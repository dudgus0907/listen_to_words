1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
idealist techie you know Stanford grad

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,279
student in the garage saying we're going

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,200
to make outcomes better those companies

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,280
all fail most early stage Founders go to

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,759
Partners and say hey like what is it

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,759
that you need like tell me and I'll just

7
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,359
deliver for you if you're looking to

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,760
them just to give me the answers they

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,400
don't know what's possible

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,160
technologically often times they're not

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,840
sure how the market trends are moving

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,720
they're not going to be able to tell you

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,960
what the answer is what they're really

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,080
really good at is telling you what the

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,640
problems are my name is p Tran I'm the

16
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,520
CEO and co-founder of FM Health FM

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,840
health is a company that is trying to

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,840
make clinical AI tools accessible to the

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,039
doctors and patients that need it we

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,800
just closed a $16 million series a round

21
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,480
we've raised a total of $31 million our

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,760
success is going to occur by enabling

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,079
big Tech big Healthcare governments AI

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,879
developers by enabling everyone in the

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,239
market to be able to collaborate and

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,239
deploy AI the way it needs to be

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,239
deployed

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
I was months away from graduating

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,439
Stanford Medical School when I actually

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,520
decided to go and leave this start my

31
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,000
first company as a medical student hudos

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,200
go stford Med for allowing us to be

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,799
extremely flexible with our time so I

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
was one of those students who kind of

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,320
had my hand in all sorts of different Pi

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
where I was doing like device work I was

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,000
working on side projects with friends

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,320
from the business school and the medical

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,439
school and atics was really at the

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,439
beginning just one of those side

41
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,960
projects as a medical student I was

42
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,000
working in the county hospital here here

43
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,920
in the barria that was a nightmare I was

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,640
there while they were transitioning from

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
paper records to electronic records

46
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,079
where doctors were losing track of

47
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,159
patients no one could figure out where

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,680
medications were people were burning out

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,719
and spending three four times as much of

50
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,640
their day on documentation as they were

51
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,759
before and actually back in the day this

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,439
was when Google Glass was still emerging

53
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,560
onto the scene everyone thought that it

54
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,079
was going to be the Advent of the

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,320
wearable era and that emerging

56
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,920
technology intersecting with the real

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,240
pain points that I was seeing in my

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,280
day-to-day Life as a medical student we

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,160
found dog Medics because we wanted to

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,039
doctor spend their day taking care of

61
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,120
patients rather than documenting patient

62
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,319
records Aug Medics and Google Glass

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,319
allow a scribe located offsite to

64
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,480
securely see and hear what the doctor

65
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,160
sees and hears during an exam in a real

66
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,680
time video we showed pretty early on

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,160
that writing the notes for the doctors

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,440
actually allows them to deliver better

69
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,440
care as well 2 3 years into my first

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,760
company I was still considering going

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,239
back and and still thinking about hey

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,760
you know what point do I maybe leave the

73
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,879
company go back to medical school become

74
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,239
a doctor but once we saw our technology

75
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,040
being used to deliver care to thousands

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,239
of additional patients a month I

77
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,280
realized wow like I have already had

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
more of an impact on healthare than I

79
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,360
would have had in my entire career as a

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,760
doctor and we went to santel Road and to

81
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,920
the The Venture Capital firms there and

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,879
we were able to raise round of funding

83
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,080
off of that idea and we spent a few

84
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,519
years probably trying to build out the

85
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,440
company prove out the idea and

86
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,080
ultimately continued to stay on leave

87
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,080
from medical school as the company

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,159
grew so a few years into the augme

89
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,280
journey I think the whole world started

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,200
to realize that Google Glass probably

91
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,680
wasn't going to be a thing and so we had

92
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,640
to figure out what are we going to do

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
with this company and with this Mission

94
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,159
if Google Glass isn't going to be a

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,920
thing and if our company's brand has

96
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,319
been built off that so far because we

97
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,519
had that really clear Mission because we

98
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,439
knew hey like you know it's not about

99
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,239
the Google Glass it's about what we

100
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,000
believed the glasses could for

101
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,360
healthcare that we were able to Pivot

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,319
and pretty rapidly launch tablet and

103
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,599
phone based versions of our software

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,439
that instead of sitting the doctor's

105
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,239
face they would bring around either card

106
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,720
around as a tablet or bring around in

107
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,879
their pocket that still did the same

108
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,239
thing I think what that taught me is

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,560
that if you go into a new technology

110
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,599
looking for a problem you're probably

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,840
going to get pretty far but ultimately

112
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,680
fail and I think the difference between

113
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,879
Aug Medics which we were able to

114
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,200
continue to grow over time and a lot of

115
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,280
those companies is that we started off

116
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,079
as a technology looking for a problem

117
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,040
but we just happened to find a really

118
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,840
really big and important problem and so

119
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,879
that allowed us to stay alive moving

120
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,479
forward from that I have become really

121
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,959
really careful around new technology

122
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,840
Trends even AI the new wave of gen AI

123
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,639
tele medicine through Co all of those

124
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,759
boom and bust Cycles they all occur

125
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,720
around emerging Technologies they never

126
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,360
occur around endemic pain points and so

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
gen today yes it it's promising yes it's

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
going to change the world is it going to

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
change the world to the scale that

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,400
everyone is saying it will at the

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,639
Timeline that everyone's saying it well

132
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,520
like guaranteed not and it's because we

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,199
always tend to overestimate these

134
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,840
Technologies in the near- term over the

135
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,120
long term they will have an impact but

136
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,320
that that long term is longer time frame

137
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,320
than any one startup is able to weather

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,199
during that journey I actually had an

139
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,240
uncle pass away from a late stage lung

140
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,360
cancer that was missed by his doctors

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,039
and it was a really frustrating

142
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
experience for myself and my family

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,680
because I already was a successful

144
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,880
entrepreneur in the digital Health space

145
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,400
when we were providing care for him and

146
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
talking to his doctors he was receiving

147
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,880
the best care in the world he was going

148
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160
regularly for his screenings you know he

149
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,520
did everything right but because his

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,800
doctors weren't using the most modern of

151
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,080
tools a lot of these AI diagnostic tools

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,280
around lung cancer that have been

153
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
launched over the past decade he wasn't

154
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,199
able to actually have his cancer time in

155
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,680
fact it was missed for almost 5 years he

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,960
would have benefited so much from

157
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,479
technology from AI tools his doctors

158
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,639
wanted to use those tools but hospitals

159
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,280
not being able to actually adopt AI

160
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,680
themselves directly like at some point

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,560
someone was going to solve it question

162
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,720
was how long will it take to solve what

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,160
we realized was if we don't start this

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,560
company it is extremely unlikely that

165
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,800
someone else will and succeed FM health

166
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,400
is our attempt at trying to solve this

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,479
disconnect between the technology that's

168
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,319
out there the need for a platform that

169
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,199
allows for the consolidation of AI

170
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,000
vendors into a single point back when we

171
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,880
first started the company I was really

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,880
skeptical about how good these AI tools

173
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
actually were some patients and some

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,000
hospitals that we worked with in Asia

175
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,039
that we launched our pilot product

176
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,960
initially and that was an open- Source

177
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,919
lung nodule tool something that was a

178
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,639
made available online for public use and

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,720
we ran it for 3 Days across their scans

180
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,840
and we basically look to see how many

181
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,120
patients does did this model find that

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,360
the doctors didn't find and 3 days later

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,440
we're like oh wow like there are almost

184
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,160
50 patients here who have very

185
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,120
significant findings it makes the

186
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,039
mission of the company just so urgent we

187
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,960
happen to have a Tailwind of AI hype

188
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
that maybe it lasts one more year maybe

189
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,879
it lasts three more years but like hype

190
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,759
Cycles come and go and so there's going

191
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,280
to be a time when that hype no longer is

192
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,560
there but for us like we solve a real

193
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,199
problem that endure over time at some

194
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,879
point you have to be solving a really

195
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,520
important problem or you will never be

196
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,759
able to claw your way out of that

197
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,879
experimentation early stage most early

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,479
stage Founders firsttime Founders that I

199
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,639
meet are overly focused on building a

200
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,520
really good technology product and not

201
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,240
enough focus on identifying the exact

202
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,840
paino and problem they're solving figure

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,919
out what matters what are the risks that

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,800
I need to drisk and proving that out

205
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
even manually right like just by doing

206
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,199
it with an Excel spreadsheet or with a

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,840
human being in the background rather

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,160
than having to launch the whole product

209
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,360
and spending all that money before

210
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,360
you've tested out those initial

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,639
assumptions Co was brutal and this is

212
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:50,479
not a super exciting kind of thing to

213
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,599
bring up but Co was absolutely brutal it

214
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,400
was especially brutal because the

215
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,919
general perspective was wow if you're a

216
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,080
Healthcare Company you should be doing

217
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,319
great but the actual reality was like

218
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,319
most companies were dying because no one

219
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,520
was able to sell unless you were very

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
specifically solving a CO problem really

221
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,120
honestly like we don't have that much to

222
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
do with global pandemic so we're solving

223
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,080
an AI deployment issue for health

224
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,599
systems and that just was not a priority

225
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,360
so keeping the team motivated keeping

226
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,680
our investors and stakeholders and

227
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,520
customers aligned and engaged and

228
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,319
excited about this problem when nobody

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,800
cared about it for years and years and

230
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,159
years was really difficult more patients

231
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,959
died due to delay in care then die from

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,039
Co we're going to keep focusing what

233
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,959
we're going to focus on and we're going

234
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,560
to try to build the best business we can

235
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,599
around this and survive until everyone

236
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,399
else kind of gets there I think that

237
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,040
easily could have led to the company

238
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,399
collapse but I think what that has

239
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,880
allowed us to do now that AI is hot now

240
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,720
that hospitales are looking at platforms

241
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,360
now that can all of our original thesis

242
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
when we founded the company have come to

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,560
bear and we've stayed focused on that

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,079
problem for the past 5 years is that we

245
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,120
are just again incredibly well

246
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:03,839
positioned and we've got such a head

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,839
start on the broader Market in order to

248
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,880
actually succeed as a Founder you've got

249
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,279
to be really comfortable with everyone

250
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,440
thinking you're wrong for a really

251
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,440
really long time I still have not seen

252
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
one example of a massive iconic company

253
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,560
where everyone didn't think that they

254
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
were completely out of their mind for

255
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,399
the first few years a human being you

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,720
usually look for societal approval as

257
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,640
Founders like you kind of have to be

258
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:33,079
comfortable um not just not having that

259
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,320
but being able to convince people who

260
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,000
otherwise didn't see it the same way you

261
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,320
did that you're right and you do have to

262
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,680
just be used to everyone either not

263
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,720
knowing what you're talking about or

264
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,800
thinking you're wrong and just

265
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,920
comfortable just over and over and over

266
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,120
convincing them of why what you're doing

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
is the right approach and why it's

268
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,519
important a lot of my classmates are now

269
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,920
you know super high-powered specialized

270
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,200
doctors that are making a ton of money

271
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,079
and so it's easy to look at hey like if

272
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,040
I just stayed as a doctor I would be

273
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,760
some you know badass surgeon doing XYZ

274
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,720
thing and especially as my friends all

275
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,959
have now Sav me a ton of lives they did

276
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,279
like it's an incredibly rewarding

277
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,720
profession that I never had a chance to

278
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,200
actually go into but that's probably one

279
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
of the sacrifices and trade-offs that I

280
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
had to make and I just have to look at

281
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,600
the hundreds and thousands of patients

282
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,959
that are technology is saving and say

283
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,440
like listen like fine like I'm not going

284
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,839
to do it directly but we're still going

285
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,200
to be able to deliver a lot of impact in

286
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,560
society and that's enough for us you

287
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,399
kind of have to start companies at a

288
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,480
young age because your risk appetite

289
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,000
goes down as you get older the downside

290
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,399
of starting a company when you're young

291
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,320
is the lack of Industry knowledge the

292
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,399
lack of Industry connections I think it

293
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,480
is much easier to solve those problems

294
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,880
just by being diligent and by networking

295
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,959
and connecting people and being

296
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,160
open-minded you can solve those problems

297
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,320
as a young person for firsttime Founders

298
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,720
it is really really easy to just go to

299
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,760
hospitals go to Partners and say hey

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
like what is it that you need like tell

301
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
me and I'll just deliver for you but the

302
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,279
real challenge is like these are

303
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,720
problems that Health Systems often times

304
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,880
don't know how to solve and so if you're

305
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,920
looking to them just to give you the

306
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,560
answers they don't know what's possible

307
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,560
technologically often times they're not

308
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,120
sure how the market trends are moving

309
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,320
and so they're not going to be able to

310
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,519
tell you what the answer is what they're

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,720
really really good at is telling you

312
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,040
what the problems are and so when we go

313
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,800
in and we work with hospitals we always

314
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,079
make sure to align around hey like what

315
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,279
are the problems they're trying to solve

316
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,040
and it's different depending on the

317
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,839
hospital some hospitals really care

318
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,160
about delivering the best care possible

319
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,880
to the patients and they want to use

320
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,279
these AI tools for that many others care

321
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,760
a lot about productivity by being really

322
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,639
clear upfront about hey we solve the

323
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,279
security problem we solve the patient

324
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,320
safety problem and if those are problems

325
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,600
that you have let us help you and if

326
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,440
they aren't great you are not the right

327
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,120
partner for us we're going to go focus

328
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,760
our time elsewhere and that's tough for

329
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,560
startups to do because you know if

330
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,279
you're looking at revenue and you

331
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,360
otherwise don't have it that can be a

332
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
really difficult decision to make but as

333
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,920
a result you know every one of our

334
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,360
customers really love the fact that we

335
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,959
solve a problem that they really care

336
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,120
about I think that's been pivotal to us

337
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,639
being able to have this trusted advisor

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,320
relationship with all of our hosital

339
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,160
Executives and faram is not going to be

340
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,680
able to be the one platform that

341
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,560
everyone everywhere in the world uses

342
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,079
for everything our success is going to

343
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,320
occur by enabling big Tech big

344
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:28,079
Healthcare governments AI developers by

345
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,600
enabling everyone in the market to be

346
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,120
able to collaborate and deploy AI the

347
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,000
way it needs to be deployed and so I

348
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,440
don't think of firm as this kind of

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,199
search bar for the internet or as Uber

350
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,480
for taxis I don't think we're going to

351
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,160
be this dominant kind of front Force I

352
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,760
think that we are building the pipelines

353
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,440
we're building the tooling the pick and

354
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,839
shovels that ideally everyone everywhere

355
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:55,320
is using and if you can make AI truly

356
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,440
fungible truly liquid um truly zero cost

357
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,760
to adopt then you end up with that

358
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,880
future state I talked about which is a

359
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,090
fundamentally transformed Healthcare

360
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,169
System

361
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,169
