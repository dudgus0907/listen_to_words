[Laughter]

292
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:31,519
okay hold on I have a new discovery okay

what's your Discovery [ __ ] I guess

294
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,199
what's your Discovery okay this it

295
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,820
sounds crazy

296
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,579
the reason why I just had to get out is

297
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,160
because you're you feel so cold and

298
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:52,380
brittle that when the ice is like

299
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,199
touching you like it like it might it

300
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,940
like hit my my knee and it just felt

301
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,579
like it was like a rock being throat

302
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,380
like it feels so like like the like the

303
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,360
ice cubes literally feel like rocks like

304
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,880
bullets yeah literally like bullets

305
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
because you're just so brittle oh my God

306
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,480
that was the worst I live once and you

307
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,680
can tell everyone

308
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,300
I think we should start with like cold

309
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,920
showers I have really dry skin so this

310
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,420
is probably bad for me hold on it's

311
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,100
