1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,640
there was a lot of fight within the

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,280
company out of 100 projects which one do

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,599
we keep it alive we should actually keep

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,440
some of it instead of dropping rest of

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,600
the 99 problems but I said no we have to

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,520
be the master of a one single product

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,439
and one single problem we don't have

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,279
resources to dilute our Focus I think I

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,679
made the right call those 99 Problems 99

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,800
products didn't matter if you have one

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,960
single killer item that's going to carry

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,960
all the way through

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:52,000
[Music]

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,199
hello my name is hin Lee I'm the captain

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,920
of Soul robotics Soul robotics is a B2B

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,519
autonomous driving company so when you

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,719
think about autonomous driving there's

18
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,760
company like Tesla and way while they

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
provide robotaxi services or a

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,040
autonomous driving service that you can

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,119
use on the public road we to be

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,200
autonomous driving is not like that we

23
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,799
provide autonomous driving Services

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,439
where there's a lot of driver shortage

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,600
we are currently focusing on two major

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,799
areas first is finished vehicle

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,880
Logistics when the car is manufactured

28
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,640
somebody has to drive these cars to the

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,880
ship or train or truck this requires 200

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,680
people perfect relocation for the car

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,119
makers currently simply there's not

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,439
enough drivers out out there who's

33
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,000
providing this type of Labor forces so

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,439
we are providing autonomous driving

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,040
system to move these cars autonomously

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,320
so that the the car can be transported

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
safely to your doorstep the Second Use

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,159
case we're focusing on as a B2B

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,759
autonomous driving company is that we

40
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,280
are focusing on the logistics centers

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,240
when you order a product that product

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,479
has to go through a large logistic

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,200
centers within this logistic centers

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,159
there is lot of manual driving needs to

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,399
be done somebody needs to move the car

46
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,200
to be charged to be cleaned to move to

47
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,360
the third floor or second floor we have

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
13 different nationality and now we've

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,880
been focusing on the B2B autonomous

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,880
driving for the last 3 4

51
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:14,560
years I went to us when I was 12 Junior

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,480
High small boarding school that's where

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,120
I spent my youth and then I went to Penn

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,720
State I guess that was my youth but

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,200
actually I want to rewind my clock L

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,080
back before I went to us until 12 I was

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,800
in Korea but my parents thought man the

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,760
robotics is going to be future well this

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
is early 2000 and when I went to Penn

60
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,239
State I studied mechanical engineering

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,760
thinking that well if I want to do

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,319
robotics I got to be able to build the

63
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,280
robots but I realized as I was studying

64
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,519
mechanical engineering the robotics is

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,560
not a hardware problem it is so much a

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,959
software problem that's where I as soon

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,440
as I graduated I started to study

68
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,200
software by myself but and then I came

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,239
back to Korea I went to Korean army cuz

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,879
I'm Korean citizen so I spent 2 years in

71
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,440
the Army as a tank mechanic so that was

72
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,040
pretty fun right after finishing my duty

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,000
as a tank tank mechanic in the Korean

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,920
army I started looking into studying Ai

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,720
and self-driving with groups of people

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,799
in 2016 I thought while the industry is

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,319
new They Don't Really teach Ai and

78
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,200
self-driving in the school yet and this

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,599
autonomous driving Market is just going

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,159
to be massive so why don't we start a

81
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,000
company to see how it can go so 2017

82
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,440
August with four of the co-founders I

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,840
started so robotics really not knowing

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,920
exactly what Market we're going to go

85
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,000
after our company started with the study

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,040
group that studied Ai and self-driving

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,920
and there was a competition the study

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,239
group attended the competition and the

89
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,519
competition member became the foundation

90
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,439
of s Robotics and I was the captain of

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,120
that study group and that title still

92
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,239
stuck with me so still today after 8

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,439
years my title is still Captain that's a

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,439
founding chapter of s

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,519
robotics so our our first business model

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,159
which was again this Sol robotics was my

97
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,519
first kick it still is we didn't a whole

98
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,599
lot we knew our computer vision

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,400
technology was pretty good so our first

100
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,120
approach was going after the oems so

101
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,480
first couple years we really chased

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,560
after that the amount of the capital

103
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,920
resource that we had we couldn't go

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,280
after kind of full autonomous driving

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,199
system and have a business model that

106
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,360
generates Revenue at the same time it

107
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,720
was going to be a very long-term just

108
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,680
purely R&D focused effort it turns out

109
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,320
that first of all the car makers

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,160
themselves moves extremely slowly and

111
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,199
they're very conservative and we

112
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,840
realized that man this trying to sell

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,360
our system to OEM is just not going to

114
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,320
work without then what else what else

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,039
can we do since then we did bunch of

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,600
different autonomous driving projects

117
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,320
there's about 100 different project that

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
we worked on sometimes we add a little

119
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,560
bit of systems Control Systems maybe

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,360
camera systems we are working as an

121
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Outsourcing company but a lot of this

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,240
project just weren't scaling I got to

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,440
feel that man this is going to be tough

124
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,000
to commercialize there is simply not

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,039
enough forerunners who have shown that

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,680
using this kind of system redu ES cost

127
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,840
or improves efficiency by significant

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,320
amount to really widely adopt this type

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,600
of technology for their B2B use cases

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,280
the first major client was BMW so they

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,080
had a very interesting problem problem

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,919
so significant that all the way to the

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,280
sea level they wanted to solve this

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,840
problem and the problem was when they

135
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,919
make the car somebody has to pick up

136
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,919
this car manually and drive them into

137
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,240
the train station and this drive was

138
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,319
anywhere 1 km 2 km or 3 km you need to

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
have three four shifts of workers

140
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,759
driving these cars and it's a large

141
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,319
Factory you need a lot of people to do

142
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,840
this in the automotive history this has

143
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,319
been never been automated so it has been

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,039
always driven by humans and that's the

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,000
problem they want to solve because

146
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,440
simply they couldn't find enough people

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,600
to drive these cars and so this was one

148
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,560
of our 100 project 99 failed and this

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,240
project succeeded that's how we had a

150
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,000
first glimpse of B2B aut autonomous

151
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,720
[Music]

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,479
driving if I were to kind of explain

153
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,240
what B2B autonomous driving is Tesla is

154
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,080
not going to provide autonomous driving

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,520
for every industry segment you can use

156
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,919
Uber app you can use Facebook app but

157
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,000
these are running on backend system of

158
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,560
AWS and AWS makes a whole lot of money

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
from all these companies AWS is a B2B

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,960
cloud system you guys might know company

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,560
like Oracle database related company or

162
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,639
Salesforce who maintains the database of

163
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,319
clients for companies and these are

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,720
purely a B2B driven backend server so to

165
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,080
say companies and B2B autonomous driving

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,960
is like that we are a specific domain

167
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,759
autonomous Driving Systems so that the

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,520
societies can operate we're the backbone

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,960
we the backend autonomous driving system

170
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,039
for the society that's how I like to

171
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,039
think of what we

172
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,080
do the difference between average and

173
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,479
the best maybe 100 to one yeah so our

174
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,000
technology is quite unique it's very

175
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,759
different from weo and Tesla first of

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,639
all we are still predominantly using lar

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,360
second of all these Lars are not on the

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,199
cars themselves these Lars are installed

179
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,840
around the infrastructures you'll be

180
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,520
able to see there's a poles and then

181
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,680
there's camera and the lighters

182
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,319
installed around the facility we have

183
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,639
embedded our robotic system into the

184
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,520
factory ground or into the building

185
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,240
itself what we have essentially done is

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,240
is along the path of this car has to

187
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,879
drive we have installed these poles

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,720
these sensors and then these cars will

189
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,280
be guided from this infrastructure

190
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,080
system the software is identical to the

191
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,560
standard self-driving which it goes into

192
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,240
the car we just have expanded on that

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,360
idea to turn the infrastructure itself

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,520
into a self-driving machine now when you

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,280
do that you can solve a lot of critical

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
issues that cannot be solved by a

197
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,919
conventional method first of all you

198
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,840
don't have to install hundreds and

199
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,520
thousands of dollars of sensors per car

200
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,520
you just need to install handful of

201
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,720
sensors around the infrastructure second

202
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,720
of all the issue with current

203
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,000
self-driving is that it cannot handle

204
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,440
heavy weather scenarios because when it

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,960
rains when it snows the sensors are are

206
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,319
blocked by precipitation but when you're

207
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,599
using infrastructure first of all you're

208
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,280
bypassing that limitation because the

209
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,440
sensors are installed lot closer to each

210
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,280
other so that firstable you can mitigate

211
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,960
just for the shortage of sensors cuz you

212
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,520
have just a lot more of them so kind of

213
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,080
brute forcing this Problem by just

214
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,240
putting more infrastructure system into

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,640
it but obviously second of all it's not

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
about the hardware it's about learning

217
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,159
how to fuse those immense amount of

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,240
sensor data processing them with the

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,440
data that you have collected for last 6

220
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,240
years to AI to figure out what is rain

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
what is snow what is noise and filter

222
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,880
all those out to exactly identify where

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,880
my fleet of cars are now this technology

224
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,440
which we call autonomy 3 infrastructure

225
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,240
gets to solve a very almost is ur

226
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,240
byproduct by doing so this was going to

227
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,079
be solving one of the critical issue for

228
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,800
the specially B2B use cases because the

229
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,760
cars needed to move in Fleet groups of

230
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,600
five groups of 10 groups of 50 groups of

231
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,200
100 cars and the current technology of

232
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,959
autonomous risings wasn't going to solve

233
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,399
that but if you're having infrastructure

234
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,640
system orchestrates fleets of car

235
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,720
simultaneously all of a sudden you can

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,240
move the fleets of cars safely we didn't

237
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,640
take the path of the least resistance we

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,079
just took the path of what kind of makes

239
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,720
sense to solve this problem at step by

240
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,920
step and it turns out that our system is

241
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,680
actually extremely cheap to deploy

242
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,959
because conventional method you need to

243
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,959
install systems for 100 cars for us it's

244
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,399
a small parking lot handful of sensors

245
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,399
then you can move hundreds of cars

246
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,240
simultaneously so CES and especially

247
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,279
Nvidia is they're looking into 10 15 20

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,160
years in the future now they're painting

249
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,320
a picture of what in is to be and they I

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,839
think they coined the term Fiscal AI

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,920
most breakthrough application is going

252
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,640
to be Robotics and fiscal AI is simply

253
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,399
AI agent going all the way to actuating

254
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,480
robotic arms and what's the difference

255
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,880
between robotic arms and engine of the

256
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,880
car it's the same it's a self-driving

257
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,800
system or you could call it humanoid

258
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,760
robotics etc etc etc and it is still few

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,800
more years away from commercialization

260
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,000
but it's slowly getting there and

261
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,320
physical AI as well eventually it's

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,760
going to get there what I admire about

263
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,720
Tesla and wayo is that they stuck to the

264
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,320
problem with the original design for

265
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,920
actually longer than anybody else with

266
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,839
extremely Talent groups of Engineers

267
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,760
this physical AI I think it just means

268
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,519
that there's more degree of Freedom

269
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,560
robotics being rolled out for many

270
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,200
different application human a robot

271
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,000
being kind of the epitome of that

272
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,959
application use cases but I think if

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,760
robotex and human is kind of similar as

274
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,720
it's like a b2c application get be

275
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,360
widely used for everybody else I think

276
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,519
it's going to be the same there's going

277
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,880
to be a lot of sectors actually that you

278
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,440
need to provide product for B2B use

279
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,560
cases for tunnel driving and there's

280
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,760
going to be a lot of Robotics for B2B

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,399
use cases as well that might not look

282
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,440
like Humanity robotics maybe somewhere

283
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,399
in between of those large industrial

284
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,560
robotics that you see in the car

285
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,959
factories and the human robotics a lot

286
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,600
of Robotics that goes into B2B sector is

287
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,600
somewhere in between it is going to be

288
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
the future it is

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,680
fixed thing that's always a big mistake

290
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,880
is going after a giant market on on day

291
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,160
one

292
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,320
I think one of the thing was a pivot

293
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,120
again we pivoted several times until we

294
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
kind of settle down on this B2B

295
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,000
autonomous driving and there was a lot

296
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,160
of fight within the company out of 100

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,040
projects which one do we keep it alive

298
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,040
we should actually keep some of it

299
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,240
instead of dropping rest of the 99

300
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,320
problems but I said no we have to be the

301
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,760
master of a one single product and one

302
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,279
single problem we don't have resources

303
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,839
to dilute our Focus I think I made the

304
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,000
right call those 9 99 Problems 99

305
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,040
products didn't matter if you have one

306
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,480
single killer item that's going to carry

307
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,320
all the way through I don't want to use

308
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,079
Samsung as a bad example but you know

309
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
Samsung and tsmc tsmc just focus on the

310
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,399
single fling you know Apple and Samsung

311
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,040
Apple focuses on a very handful of

312
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,480
products Samsung does a lot of things if

313
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,920
you look at the pure evaluation how the

314
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
market perceives those two three

315
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,160
companies tsmc and Apple has an higher

316
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,440
evaluation than Samsung I think that

317
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,560
makes sense one risk that has massive

318
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,040
upside that if I failed in this it's

319
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,079
okay because that was a massive upside

320
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,639
instead of the mediocre Market

321
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,480
distribute our focus on different

322
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,600
autonomous driving projects that was

323
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,199
just going to be mediocre all all around

324
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,560
and that's the risk of starting a

325
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,519
company if you fail we fail but if you

326
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,680
succeed in this one market segment that

327
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,760
is going to be so massive that just it

328
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,880
wouldn't be matter and that kind of

329
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,560
thing as the company grew people had a

330
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,279
different opinions about what kind of

331
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,079
product to build what kind of focus we

332
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,560
need to have multi-product strategy

333
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,440
multiple a strategy etc etc etc I didn't

334
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,720
like that I think those were some of the

335
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,720
kind of

336
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,680
learnings let's take for example Tesla

337
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,800
they started with focusing on the

338
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,880
electric motor itself they actually

339
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,760
could build a pretty good powerful

340
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,160
Efficient Electric Motor so they start

341
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,959
building that only and west of the car

342
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,839
component they just kind of Outsource it

343
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,399
battery car body or whatever the next

344
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
thing was the battery Focus on the

345
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,600
better technology was going to be very

346
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,959
important for Tesla's future and then

347
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,000
after that they were trying to sell the

348
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,639
car using the body of somebody else's

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,959
and they learned that okay you actually

350
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,399
got to build the body frame around your

351
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,199
core technology to build a solid product

352
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,800
that you can sell and Tesla actually

353
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,519
worked on Outsourcing some of their

354
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
Battery Technology and the power train

355
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,680
technology in the early days so they

356
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,519
were doing some of the Outsourcing

357
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,920
before they built their first product of

358
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,639
the model S but that is building one

359
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,079
success on top of each other to build

360
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,639
vertical Iz ation of Technology into a

361
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,000
singular solid product that outperforms

362
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,480
everybody else's so is we kind of took

363
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
the similar approach when it comes to

364
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,959
tunel driving perception was the most

365
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
important thing so we really delve

366
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,240
deeply into solving the computer vision

367
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,199
problem on top of that we were medling

368
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,360
around many different applications but

369
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,639
we found that in order to serve the B2B

370
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,759
autonomous driving problems we got to

371
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,240
build the entire product not just the

372
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,040
perception side we got to build the

373
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,040
planning and we got to build control we

374
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,600
got to build a system around that to

375
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,120
make our product work so that kind of

376
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
verticalization was extremely important

377
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,959
in order for that to work you still

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,560
actually got to own that core

379
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,880
differentiation technology for yourself

380
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,959
you can Outsource that and I think

381
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,560
that's one of the problem that a lot of

382
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,920
existing car makers are having cuz their

383
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,959
core technology is not batteries or

384
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,800
software or electrical motor it's

385
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,560
assembling parts so this core technology

386
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,000
differentiation is kind of showing the

387
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,000
impact

388
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:04,160
today we want to kind of Rebrand

389
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,440
ourselves and I thought te is just the

390
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,000
perfect domain for our website so

391
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,160
robotics. te sound perfect for our new

392
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,240
chapter that's why we chose Tech domain

393
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
if you're a hardcore tech company te

394
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,040
seems like the Just Right Choice like

395
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
hardcore robotics especially it's the

396
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,279
perfect domain autonomous driving that

397
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,360
we know is not just limited to robot

398
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:28,160
taxi there's just lot to do in the world

399
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,519
the driver shortage is severe in Korea

400
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,800
and Asia we need to provide robust

401
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,639
autonomous driving technology to the

402
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,279
backbone industry it's still in the

403
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,120
early days there's a lot to do right now

404
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,360
we are the only very few companies in

405
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,279
the world who's providing autonomous

406
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,880
driving technology to multiple car

407
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,639
makers and multiple logistics companies

408
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,440
I think we're going to be one of the

409
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,440
longlasting and very successful

410
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,120
autonomous driving company that solved

411
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
this severe societal problem we are

412
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
based in Korea if you want to solve

413
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,120
autonomous driving problems across the

414
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,360
different domains of Industry please

415
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,430
have a take a look at our website Sor

416
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,570
bar. Tech
