18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,760
flag about each other to feel better

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,620
about herself awesome I have all my red

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,399
flags written down I've not won green

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,399
flag written down

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,780
reading it from a book makes it seem

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,780
like a Bible verse

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,000
we all start eating better but then also

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,220
suggest Cane's 20 minutes after okay

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,020
that's great that's insane that's

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,360
awesome that was great a lot but you

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,860
can't be yeah see my point is when I say

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,119
oh I think we should eat better it's not

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,619
that I think we should eat better like

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
fruits and vegetables I think we just

32
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,640
need to eat a [ __ ] meal it's like the

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,500
problem is we don't go get food so I

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,060
think canes even though it's not good

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,860
for you you can think you have to eat

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,540
better until indulge in canes like you

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,340
eat canes knowing like oh I should eat

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,720
better no I eat Cane's thinking like

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,439
this you know you better if it's better

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,439
than not eating

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,380
that's not the red flag though the red

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,600
flag is that the stuffed animal has

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,820
severe privileges over the swamp in this

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,860
bed and the rules of the bed so if you

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,440
sit in the bed but the stuffed animal

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,140
Falls you have to like pick him up

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,640
apologize put him back everyone away on

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,400
the left side with the stuffed animals

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,080
there Mr pugington has to tell you oh Mr

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,660
wrinkles has to tell you whether or not

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,040
you're allowed to sit there so the red

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,420
flag is not the stuffed animal itself

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
it's the fact that this stuffed animal

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,680
is literally a tyrant up the back that's

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,459
the problem

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,680
that was great thank you Nick Mr

57
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,260
wrinkleton there it is I don't think

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,780
that's a red flag at all I think that if

59
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,340
like here's the way I look at it if I

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,319
were to go into your room

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,120
I wouldn't sleep on where you normally

62
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,519
do like on your side of the bed well

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,280
it's a stuffed animal yes I know that

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,900
but it's like don't like walk over like

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,459
yes opinion sometimes weighs more than

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,599
you like I see you go to the opposite

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,640
side of the bed because he's already

68
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,319
there that's not true at all yes it is I

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,080
just think like you shouldn't walk into

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,940
my room if you want to sleep with me and

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,500
take my stuffed animal and throw it on

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,500
the floor I don't throw it on the floor

73
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,720
never sleeps in the same bed two nights

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,000
in a row either mine his own Nicks or

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,459
the couch true I mean I like to switch

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,840
it up I don't like to be I hate that so

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,459
then I wake up and I feel really weird

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
if I'm not like where I want to wake up

79
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,300
no I like wake up and sometimes I have

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,980
no idea where I am because you switch

81
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,319
every day like you literally zero clue

82
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,180
like even back home like I have no no I

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,739
don't wake up in L.A thinking you woke

84
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,780
up in Boston and wake up in Boston

85
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,120
thinking I just I don't know man I'm all

86
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,180
over the place especially with Tor I

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,840
feel like it's your turn

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,299
oh mg that was terrifying

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,560
oh car driving by slow I'm scared Look

90
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,720
Away hey don't do that mine's for Nick

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,760
he complains and complains and complains

92
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,220
and complains about stuff and openly

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
complains about it knowing there isn't a

94
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,480
solution he just wants his point across

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,280
that he's complaining so then you like

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,680
try to find them why are you complaining

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,780
why wouldn't there be a solution you no

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,220
you have admitted it to things like oh

99
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,840
there's nothing we can do about it and

100
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,139
there's no solution better than you

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,639
[ __ ] for an hour and a half just for us

102
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:30,979
but you literally complain about things

103
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,979
that literally you admit have no sense

104
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,680
sorry I've heard Nick say like there's

105
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,639
nothing I can do about it but I'm just

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:43,020
gonna maybe like complain I have a lot

107
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,100
of strong feelings and requests and okay

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,080
I wanted to say what are you doing

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,360
feelings and requests emotions and

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,000
desires

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,500
it's rather than like keeping them it's

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,660
rather than keeping them internal I

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,340
vocalize but here's the thing we don't

114
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,380
care like we don't care

115
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,720
no you need a [ __ ]

116
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,600
like what is grabbing the chair gonna be

117
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,919
scared okay Matt will like every once in

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,320
a while me and Matt will go to the gym

119
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,080
and he will work out to the point so he

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,419
literally hurts himself like like Matt

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,660
will work out to the absolute extreme

122
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:25,440
levels like no socks on or something no

123
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,660
he had socks on and he has his ankles so

124
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,060
he ran on a treadmill till like his

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,400
we're gushing blood and he looks like he

126
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,280
was gonna pass out the whole time beat

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,280
red like

128
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,660
all confused I think he's just so like I

129
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,699
don't think you guys go often enough

130
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,880
that it's routine so his body just don't

131
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,500
know what to do he doesn't

132
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,300
like work out and then like Bill build

133
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,880
up he goes straight for like power

134
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,720
workouts

135
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,520
I just want it more than you know insane

136
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,259
Matt would like that's so true though I

137
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,820
literally works out to the point till he

138
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,199
came no it's bad like I run on the

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,020
treadmill to the point where he's like I

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,960
can't even make it back home oh you're

141
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,360
like dying iPhone for that though would

142
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,380
let an entire African Stampede Run him

143
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,300
over and then apologize to them

144
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,160
and that's the truth Matt has like a lot

145
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,900
of really really sorry I'm sorry yeah

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,520
like he says I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm

147
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,380
sorry but he like literally puts himself

148
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,860
in the way of danger nothing's worse

149
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,180
than her I'm sorry I'll stop yeah

150
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,620

152
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,280

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
like that's that works that's good

161
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,560

162
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
yeah

163
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,699

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
later he goes guys it's we're leaving at

165
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,740
five for the premiere so we should

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,960
probably get dressed and get ready soon

167
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,280
oh like he says yeah opposite of this

168
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,720
makes it seem like he came up yeah

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
that's so frustrating okay

170
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,220
okay go ahead you guys both ask me

171
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,720
questions as if I work with a plan and

172
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,819
then you're asking questions like that

173
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,160
are ridiculous like you you guys know

174
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,340
like the warranty and like the [ __ ]

175
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,400
Apple care and I'm like I do not know I

176
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,259
do not work there I've never worked

177
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
there and I don't [ __ ] know the

178
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,220
answer to your questions Chris is like

179
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
Nick why is the Wi-Fi out and I'm like I

180
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,340
don't know because I also don't have

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Wi-Fi then I use my critical thinking

182
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,440
skills and I go to the living room with

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,780
a Wi-Fi routers and Chris unplug it back

184
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,520
in and I'm like oh maybe that's the

185
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,840
solution to your Wi-Fi problem or we

186
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,180
could be like eating and Matt's like

187
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,039
watching this is like the restaurant I'm

188
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,780
like I don't work here I don't think all

189
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,120
the ingredients I'd tell you if I did

190
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,220
but I don't and it's questions that are

191
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,440
so specific to like you'd literally have

192
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,180
to work at The Establishment or for the

193
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,280
company of the questions you guys are

194
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,319
asking me also I'm still in the mood to

195
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,599
talk so I'm gonna read my next one which

196
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,880
is about you both again and you yell at

197
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,740
me for taking a long time to prepare to

198
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,080
get out of the car we're not done in the

199
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,660
car but I carry way more things than you

200
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,800
that's not true and it's always like you

201
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,000
guys are always telling me to go and

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,599
you're asking me oh where's the camera

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,460
as if our whole job isn't like it's all

204
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,319
of our jobs to bring the camera to the

205
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,240
car to film videos it's all of our jobs

206
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,979
to Vlog and you guys constantly yell at

207
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,940
me when I'm not ready to vlogger me I

208
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,680
don't have the camera when you guys

209
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,900
never have it because it's always my

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,340
responsibility for who knows God knows

211
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,200
what reason

212
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,339
that was good I do that I can keep going

213
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,080
the first one is just I feel like you're

214
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,240
a knowledgeable guy yeah and you just

215
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,979
can get it done more than I can look if

216
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,539
anyone has a chance to know it would be

217
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,680
you I know that that's true but like

218
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,560
when it's like we're at a restaurant

219
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,880
like Matt's worse than I yeah like he

220
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,339
asked me questions that you literally

221
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,160
cannot know unless you literally work

222
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,720
there or just like Insane luck okay like

223
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,720
insanity

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,720
okay

225
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,679
[Music]

226
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Nikki gets proven wrong about a

227
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,440
situation but somehow still thinks he's

228
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,000
correct because I am no you're not

229
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,880
arguable like Nick will go oh my God

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,720
I know I'm wrong but and then try to he

231
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,720
then that's true

232
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,700
that's true yes exactly I know I know

233
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,640
that I was wrong here but we'll talk

234
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,740
about it he tries to explain why he was

235
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,899
wrong so he makes you think it out from

236
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,480
his point of view on why oh my God what

237
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,660
he did I haven't really so annoying Nick

238
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,300
is very clumsy that's not true so here's

239
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,680
the red flag ready Nick will fall and

240
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,440
then be embarrassed because of how

241
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,200
clumsy he is and how badly he fell so

242
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,700
he'll blame you for him falling even

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,920
though you have nothing to do with it

244
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,680
like I put this next stumble downstairs

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,500
and then go Chris and I'm like literally

246
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,360
across the room like I have no idea what

247
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,160
to do and then he yells at you and yells

248
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,839
at you like like why would you do that

249
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,279
are you kidding me are you serious and

250
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,279
I'm like I literally am 10 feet away

251
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,019
I don't know [ __ ]

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,660
nickel trip over his own boxes all right

253
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,339

254
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,839
okay I have another one oh wait I have

255
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,360
one for Matt I have a quick one for Matt

256
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,640
Matt has an actual obsession with Liam

257
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,860
Neeson yeah I love Liam Neeson loves

258
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,779
them way too much but he's so good he's

259
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,820
such a good actor are you kidding he's

260
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,339
like two rubies that he said it doesn't

261
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,019
matter okay I have a theory on Liam

262
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,660
Neeson but I'm not gonna get into it

263
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,579
okay just go ahead no it's fine no a

264
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,560
little bit

265
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:27,420
oh I know what you mean nobody Matt has

266
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,060
a theory that he thinks Liam Neeson is

267
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,279
like an actual like trained assassin

268
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,459
killer in real life okay here's the

269
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,620
thing if he's getting all these roles to

270
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,720
be a killer and an assassin and like an

271
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,000
undercover agent or just like if you see

272
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,160
a Liam Neeson movie at this point he

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,779
might as well be one in real life yeah

274
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
because there's no you've acted out the

275
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,260
same thing 10 times that's part of your

276
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,300
personality now like I just like if I

277
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,579
meet Liam Neeson I want to feel like I'm

278
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,000
in danger of him like shooting me at any

279
00:11:53,579 --> 00:12:00,240
second oh my God

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,800

281
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,140
putting them on a plate and grabbing

282
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,899
numerous water bottles before even like

283
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,600
trying to attack

284
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,700
like if we know Matt's like we he has to

285
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,620
allocate like a half hour of time to

286
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,140
eating like spicy what does that shape

287
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,700
mean how do you spell it alligator like

288
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,200
when you allocate time you like like

289
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,480
plan it out and you like make a

290
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,820
particular like oh this time how do you

291
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,779

with that delayed like the feeling like

300

I feel like I felt it once I leaned back

301
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,160
I will agree that the water is excessive

302
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,779
but I put chips in a bowl or a plate

303
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,019
because when you all right cool we don't

304
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:54,060

305
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,100
nickel nickel asked for help when in

306
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,360
reality he just wants my company so then

307
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,220
I'll go there and then sit there and

308
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,260
I'll have nothing to do to help him but

309
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,320
then he'll just like be mad Nick will

310
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,240
drop something in his room every single

311
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,980
[ __ ] night and I'll hear it from like

312
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
the kitchen or something like he'll go

313
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,120
upstairs but oh good night and I hear

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,980
like a smash like 20 minutes later too a

315
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,660
broom like what are you doing like and

316
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,600
then another thing I have is he can't

317
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,639
hang up anything on a wall properly like

318
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,920
whenever Nick put something on a wall it

319
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,899
has like a 48 hour limit until it's like

320
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,120
collapsing to the ground yep there was a

321
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,820
night where I was sleeping on the couch

322
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,680
and it [ __ ] she had a frame or

323
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,079
something and he hung up and it smashed

324
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,760
to the ground shattered broke [ __ ]

325
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,380
like three in the morning and I

326
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,820
facetimed him and he didn't answer so I

327
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,500
like ran upstairs because I thought he

328
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,480
like fell through his [ __ ] glass

329
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,779
shower door and was like gonna be naked

330
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,420
bloody and wet so

331
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:50,279
I ran up I ran up to his room to try to

332
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,260
help him so I literally thought like the

333
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,720
worst like I thought he like got like I

334
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,399
thought an FBI agent kicked through his

335
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,680
window and like was attacking him

336
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,820
upstairs and then I and then I don't

337
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,380
even know what happened I got it halfway

338
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,320
up the stairs you like called me back or

339
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,480
something but it was just insane there's

340
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,180
a red flag for Chris he never flushes

341
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,440
the toilet yes I've been way better now

342
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,880
you have been better but you always have

343
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,620
your own bathroom so you could go full

344
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,700
day and we didn't just don't know well I

345
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,200
don't use my own bathroom really because

346
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,720
my room's all the way downstairs yeah

347
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,000
you use mine he needs to go in a hot tub

348
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,279
or craves the feeling of one at least

349
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,779
one time every two weeks that's very

350
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,279
accurate and it's really annoying

351
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,660
especially when he craves at like three

352
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,240
in the morning it's like bro nobody

353
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,820
wants to like go hunt for a hot tub with

354
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
you literally that's fine

355
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,180
but I do really enjoy it I feel like

356
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,800
with the I was telling Nick the second I

357
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,139
go in a hot tub I feel like it unlocks a

358
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,760
new window his creative portal no

359
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,440
literally like I could I cut like I'll

360
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,720
go in a hot tub and just instant ideas

361
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,160
like so many new ideas okay I'm gonna

362
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,980
read a few off because I'm almost done

363
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,720
Matt will doordash every single meal and

364
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,699
force us to spend double the amount of

365
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,500
money for food when he won't drive and

366
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,300
then we end up having way too much money

367
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,100
spent in food when we could just be

368
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,260
reducing the cost by driving down the

369
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,459
street that's true and sometimes it's

370
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,920
good to go for the drive as well

371
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,199
whenever me and Nick need Matt's opinion

372
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,000
for a new idea or a new project he'll

373
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,120
wait till both of us express ours then

374
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,279
go oh yeah I agree oh oh it makes me

375
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,600
want to just drag them on like do you

376
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,579
know when like someone has like those

377
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,560
long conference tables and you want to

378
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,420
put you on the table and drag you across

379
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,519
and then throw you into the wall once

380
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,620
you're all the way like down like

381
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,180
yeah that just means I think you have

382
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,380
great opinions on things no because it's

383
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,899
just annoying because it's like we're

384
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,459
all and then he'll and then we'll do

385
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,800
something and fully format it and then

386
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,839
like an hour later and then like an hour

387
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
later we'll complain like we're like oh

388
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,420
yeah this is what we're gonna do we're

389
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,060
gonna move forward oh I agree and then

390
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,279
we move forward yeah I'm sure about that

391
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,839
Matt couldn't quickly accurately tell

392
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,399
you one favorite color when you ask

393
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,720

another red flag where I'm at my last

410
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,779
one that I'm gonna share anyway is he

411
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,820
wants me protect not even creative but

412
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,800
is so easily distracted by his phone

413
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,779
like an iPad kid like the second he

414
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,459
opens his phone he's like sucked into

415
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,320
another dimension all right last one

443
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,500
if you don't want to and you tell him to

444
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,539
stop he never does but then he's

445
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,400
surprised if you're annoyed at the

446
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,440
volume listen Nick this is one of the

447
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,539

448
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,220
and jump and sing along with everyone in

449
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,320
the room until everyone has a headache

450
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,760
and then continue to do it yes but then

451
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,280

452
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,679
people are upset okay

453
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,480
never go ahead is he'll pick an accent

454
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,640
or a character

455
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,799
and then not drop it for like three

456
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,140
hours like he'll pick like a British

457
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,059
accent that's the cartoon character and

458
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,850
then Chris is just embodies them for

459
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,039

Chris knows what he wants in a sense of

486
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,919
like he will not let himself into a

487
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,440
situation where he will disappoint

488
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,700
himself or other people like if he feels

489
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,200
like he's gonna upset you by getting

490
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,640

thinks he is and claims that he can't do

509
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,580
certain things but he's definitely

510
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,520
capable of if he put like a little bit

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:22,640
