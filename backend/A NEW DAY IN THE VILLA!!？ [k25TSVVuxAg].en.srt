363
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,360
quantities of content and I feel like

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,279
right now we're just spitting YouTube

365
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,839
videos at you guys but we want to focus

366
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,519
more on filming better videos and just

367
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,319
having more fun and being more positive

368
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,319
people I love it yeah and also I mean

369
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:45,160
you guys have been seeing we've been

370
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,680
going live on Twitch every once and a

371
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,040
while so if you want to we're probably

372
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,519
going to start frequently Twitch

373
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,399
streaming more with the lack of actual

374
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,880
YouTube content going out so go make

375
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,759
sure you're followed to our twitch

376
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,959
stream so that you can tune in whenever

377
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,199
you want um we also have a plan to start

378
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,400
posting our twitch streams onto Stern's

379
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,199
live that YouTube channel um so that if

380
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,480
you don't miss if you miss the stream

381
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,480
and you're not actually like one of the

382
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,480
live viewers while it's happening you

383
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,959
can just re-watch it at a later time so

384
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,559
basically all we're saying is the lack

385
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
of Wednesday videos on this YouTube

386
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,959
channel does not mean you're going to

387
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,760
get any less content from us it's just

388
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,439
going to be replaced in different ways

389
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,919
like twitch streams twitch streams

390
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
