00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,299
experienced a lot with friends we

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,979
already had that I did not think we'd be

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,720
able to experience like just wild wild

34
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,159
things yeah I never expected myself to

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,380
go on a tour ever in my life and I'm

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,360
just like damn girl you really did that

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,700

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,579
be able to do that at all whatsoever I

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,040
had no idea like the like what it was

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,320
gonna all be about this and that and I'm

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,540
very happy that we did it and I will say

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,520
a lot of people were like oh tour's over

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,759
no more tour content no more of this no

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,399
more of that like Malcolm and Trill with

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,740
that tour experience with them was such

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,179
like a like keep in mind we're living

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,099
with every single people that we went on

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,360
that tour with it was such a bonding

49
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,360
experience person

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,940

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
I don't know where he went yeah I'm

52
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,360
following with what he's going I'm so

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,340
confused now I was basically trying to

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,020
say that like oh people are like oh I'm

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,459

they're going back home so it's gonna be

59
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,459
difficult to make content together but

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,020
don't fear because we will be with our

61
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,160
friends eventually and we will continue

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,599

[ __ ] Tour all right recap it Chris

75
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,379
start no I wanted to say first and

76
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,660
foremost oh yeah while we were on tour

77
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,000
oh there was a lot going on and we were

78
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,340
so busy my thoughts yeah we are all so

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,159
busy that we couldn't really do much

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,920
like and put our full effort into enough

81
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,840
no we could do a Nick I don't give a

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,700
[ __ ] well no I said first and foremost

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,280
oh yeah and then went on a crazy

84
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,920
different care go ahead I'm just telling

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,780
them basically since we are so busy on

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,640
tour and everything yes we forgot to

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,140
thank you guys for four million and like

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,519
a bunch of other stuff that we wanted to

89
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,019
just say it just didn't seem like we

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,159
were like we were very connected with

91
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,599
the people that we were meeting in

92
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,640
person obviously because we were like

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,980
meeting fans in person but like we

94
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,239
hadn't filmed the video in Forever

95
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,200
obviously because we were on a tour so

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,239
it was kind of like this weird

97
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,920
disconnect from like everyone we didn't

98
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,200
yeah like all the content we were

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,540
posting was aged content that was filmed

100
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,159
like a month prior yeah so it felt a

101
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,780
little weird but now that we're back we

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,599

112
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,560
funny reactions and like moments that we

114
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,280
every single one of our q and A's on

115
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,080
tour we were talking about our podcast

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,340
and a podcast update so I'm sure that a

117
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,600
bunch of you guys have seen clips of it

118
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,580

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,020
um Tick Tock and such of like people who

120
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,840
recorded that and posted it obviously

121
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,780
but basically me maker has been hinting

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,979
at a podcast since July

123
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,300
I've been hinting on a podcast since

124
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,340
July because I really wanted to do it

125
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,960
but our podcast did not happen obviously

126
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,120
and we went a whole different route with

127
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,520
it but it's going to be spectacular

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,560
that's a good word to use that's a great

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,699
great one but our podcast is going to be

130
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,740
amazing

131
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,800
um so when this Friday video comes out

132
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,000
we're going to already be back in La

133
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,979
hopefully if our flight goes according

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,540
to plan we're safe

135
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,580
um no I'm just saying like if we don't

136
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,919
our flight if nothing goes wrong I don't

137
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,139
like speaking like oh we'll be in La I

138
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,060
don't know the world I don't plan you

139
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,340
know the world plans me I'll see what

140
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,840
happens yeah you know what I mean

141
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,460
because then I feel like it's bad vibes

142
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm like oh well yeah okay I'm trying to

143
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,300
predict the future and I can't do that

144
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,740
go but if everything goes according to

145
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,660

like something so quick

184
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,539
no really quick Nick it's a car video

185
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,979
all right overall funniest moment that

186
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,060
you experienced yeah we can tell one

187
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,800
memory each that we should get two

188
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,440
memories each a funny and a good okay

189
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,780
funny and a good okay my favorite funny

190
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,960
memory was when Nick fell off the bed in

191
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,840
New Mexico no that was in Van Horn Texas

192
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,539
probably my favorite memory was probably

193
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,759
I want to say a formal nice thank you to

194
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,280
Mr Landing Cube for coming to the LA

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,860
show because that was a 10 out of 10

196
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,319
experience that I got to witness in my

197
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,120
life because that's another thing I want

198
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,759
to talk about for the tour recap video

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,699
is I've been a fan of Landon and skies

200
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,680
since like freshman year of high school

201
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,660
and to be able to do our own tour with

202
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,940
our fans in the crowd but then have him

203
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,100
perform for our fans and our fans know

204
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,020
the words to that song it was just a

205
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,180
very full circle yeah it was kind of

206
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,840
like the Matrix

207
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,840
not even close to the Matrix Red Bull

208
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,840
sugar-free

209
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,160
camera's gonna die any second so okay

210
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,419
that has been our recap and we hope so

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,860
that's what we're looking forward to and

212
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,960
kind of our recap on things we're gonna

213
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,539
do another podcast episode completely

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,039
separate about tour so we can't really

215
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,900

217
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,840
don't want to bore you guys because

218
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,460
these are supposed to be comical and fun

219
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,740

223
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,020

251
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,019

mine would be stir fry by Migos

258
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,860
so awful it's like uncomprehensible

259
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
that was the worst answer I've ever

260
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,940
heard in my life but you can just use

261
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,459

262
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,180

East Coast song

265
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,580
yeah people on the west coast don't know

266
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,620
about that song no if you know about it

267
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,740
it's just a good old East Coast ballpark

268
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,660
I'll probably be breathed by Lil Skies

269
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,220
your love I guess so I can just tell

270
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,300
y'all to [ __ ] breathe that's all I

271
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,300
need breathe breathe

272
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,339
why or that's I don't like this question

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,800
that's a terrible question I don't like

274
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,660
this question if you had any superpower

275
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
but it had to be completely useless what

276
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,899
would it be it could

277
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,899
like like like it'd have to eat I do my

278
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,820
vegetables through my belly button like

279
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,959
I'd be completely useless but it'd be

280
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,420
super power

281
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,860
I

282
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,540
could like

283
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,120
never mind what do you I don't want to

284
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,620
say say it sharpen sharpen pencils like

285
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,000
really quick nope because that'd be

286
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,560
useful

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,420
you need something that's completely

288
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,459
useless like you could do it anyway and

289
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,160
just like laser eyes but they only work

290
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,140
with my eyes shut

291
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,760
that's valid actually because it'd be

292
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,260
useless because you could not see the

293
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,360
what the [ __ ] your lasering that's a

294
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,279
valid answer thank you of course um I'm

295
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,420
gonna go with like

296

297
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,260
their different sizes you can get away

298
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,360
with it wrong

299
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,300
I would just repeatedly steal the same

300
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,339
okay whatever I don't know

301
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,339
it has to be useless okay I would use

302
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,200
super heroes I could only enable it when

303
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:29,060
I'm listening to music with max volume

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,760
headphones see that's so good

305
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,860

if one of my legs are broken yes yeah

312
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,240
like you just couldn't do it mine would

313
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,339
be like I'd be able to push a shopping

314
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,360
cart really really quickly but I can't

315
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,480

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,980
anything in it oh that's a good one so

317
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,779
it's like you could push a shopping cart

318
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,959
really quick like what's the point yeah

319
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,920

they call it like fire pit logs like no

322
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,959
[ __ ] obvious like I wasn't gonna put

328
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,700
that I just need to there's just a big

329
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,380
disconnect in social media world that

330
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,820
people just don't understand and I feel

331
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,800
like our podcast is going to really give

332
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,779
us the outlet to connect more to deeper

333
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
level and understanding of us see I like

334
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,399
I like keeping our car videos fun

335
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,660
humorous and a good time correct and for

336
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,220
the fans that want to see more real life

337
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,500
stereo low triplet [ __ ] where it's like

338
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,000
Amazon and it's like we don't we

339
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,920
mentally drain it yeah I want them to

340
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,300
see that too but I want to that's why

341
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,000
these are always but I also feel like

342
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,399
fun this is a good car video to watch if

343
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,720
like you want to know what our podcast

344
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,860

with the good old house

349
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,820

00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:41,459
I'm also really so it's like I'm like

365
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,040
just to have more like grown-up

366
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,660
conversations like and I'm also really

367
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,880
excited because a lot of you guys are

368
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,579
kind of like but hey we're still us oh

369
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,860
[ __ ] you let me speak a lot of a lot of

370
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,360
you guys are like or my biggest fear

371
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,160
with starting a podcast and I told Matt

372
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,560
and Chris this was like what are we

373
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,540
gonna do in an hour-long formatted video

374
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,279
that's different from the car videos

375
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,079
because the car videos are kind of like

376
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,459
they're our source of entertainment you

377
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,579
guys know that like where they're funny

378
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:10,860
and they're quick it's all quick comedy

379
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,360
in the card I feel like so oh my God

380
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,100
sorry guys what I'm saying is kind of

381
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,660
like our podcast is gonna be so

382
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,339
different because it's gonna not just be

383
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,139
that quick humor that we're making car

384
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,660
videos yeah and another reason I'm just

385
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,760
really excited Matt shut the [ __ ] up

386
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,860
another reason I'm really excited for

387
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,360
our podcast and to get like more on a

388
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,459
serious level with you guys is I feel

389
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,579
like there's kind of a skewed perception

390
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,260
of like who me Matt and Chris you did

391
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,579
whenever there's a skew that I think

392
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,639
it's just like a skill I think of a

393
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:40,380
kebab yes there's like a skewed

394
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,720
perspective of like who me Matt and

395
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,420
Chris are as people as individuals

396
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:50,820
because it's like you're only seeing us

397
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:53,339
shut the [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up leave

398
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,079
the car you guys only see us like joking

399
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,180
around like getting really angry about

400
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,040
something Nick yells at me so I feel

401
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,680
like I'm really excited for you guys to

402
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,959
like have to like you guys are gonna see

403
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,279
an hour long of me and I feel like I

404
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,740
feel like it's kind of like I'm a

405
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,060
different person a little bit nickel

406
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,519
than us I feel like I'm kind of a

407
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,800
different person like funny car videos

408
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,779
I'm excited first yes I see more I

409
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,459
actually believe it I [ __ ] hate you

410
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,500
both and I don't want to deal with this

411
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,959
little stupid little act that I'm making

412
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,180
you guys upset it's not an act

413
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,699

yourself that was weird

415
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,480

I literally thought this was all black

419
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,360

O'Reilly's Auto Parts

I feel like there's another there's a

439
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,899
few that were missing

440
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,899
um what's oh cinnamon rolls

441
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,079
that's a good one we know a thing or two

442
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,420
because we've seen that they were two

443
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,759
farmers

444
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,100
like we're not so crazy to me what every

445
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,899
single person in this world right has

446
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,000
their own experiences and has their own

447
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,919
opinion on everything and has their own

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,900
version of like a truth in a situation

449
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,760
and has their own version of like things

450
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,980
that they've been through where every

451
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,480
single person's unique experience is

452
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,839
completely different

453
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,040
so do you think there's like one defying

454
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,620
like

455
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,860
right and wrong or like the truth versus

456
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,179
the false in every situation like in

457
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,040
general I genuinely be like oh that's

458
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,660
true it's like how the [ __ ] do you know

459
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,580
you can say oh that's orange but it's

460
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,679
like what is really Orange

461
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,120
I mean I I kind of know what you were

462
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,400
saying until you said some dumb [ __ ] at

463
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,260
the end but it's like I think like it's

464
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,020
just crazy it's just crazy how different

465
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,200
everyone's life is because like me you

466
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,120
and Matt like bro we users stick

467
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,120
together so much and we're always

468
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,860
together for 19 years yet there's still

469
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,080
so many things that I've experienced

470
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,600
like that you guys won't you know what I

471
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,760
mean yeah so that just shows like if I

472
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,400
have certain feelings about someone or

473
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,500
something or something bad happens in my

474
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,260
life and I'm affected by it negatively

475
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,179
and you two aren't even like that just

476
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,160
blows my mind how everything is a

477
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,020
difference oh it's also so crazy down to

478
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,620
like everybody because bro we literally

479
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,120
I legit oh my God what's so crazy I

480
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,340
spend every moment of every day with you

481
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,919
guys what's so crazy on the same exact

482
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,780
point as you is like week the three of

483
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,020
us could be experiencing the exact same

484
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,840
thing like exact same thing but like one

485
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,480
of us is like slightly different in that

486
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,919
situation which leads to a completely

487
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,600
different feeling about it I also feel

488
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,580

489
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,860
about like what's going what happened

490

before that situation at least with the

491
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,480
helpful hardware folks I feel like how

492
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,580
you feel about us like going into a

493
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,440
situation can really affect how you

494
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,440
leave that situation for sure

495
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,500
