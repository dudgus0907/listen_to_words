parents to these little egg babies they

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,399
don't have they don't have faces or

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,360
identities yet so we're going to spend

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,840
the next few minutes stop stop you know

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,680
like the parents are like oh come

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
on like that they have no identities

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,760
right now they're just blank eggs so

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,360
we're going to customize our children

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,480
while we customize them and give them

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,879
their little personalities we're going

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,320
to go over a couple of ground rules

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,760
ground rules of and requirements of what

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,440
has to happen we're going to have to

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,199
wake up several times throughout the

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,039
night to calm our baby down in the they

25
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:07,200
cry no I'm not waking up another ground

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,920
rule if your egg cracks it dies so you

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,479
cannot kill your kid in the next 24

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,360
hours or you lose the video everyone

29
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,240
liked this video cuz Nick's gay another

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,680
thing to note is there is no sabotage so

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,840
you can't go around trying to kill other

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,680
brother's babies your nieces and nephews

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,240
right yes I can feel his yoke Mr yi yi

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,400
yi I wonder if you could pre-s scramble

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,680
eggs is that a thing

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,280
my egg kind of looks like Jeremy

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,280
fragrance no no

38
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,640
way oh my God that's the scariest thing

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
I've ever seen in my life he's kind of

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,520
ugly I kind of want to kill him and try

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,159
again no you can't that's your kid I'd

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,759
let it happen if your kid was ugly would

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,640
you kill it and try

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,759
again I'm going to kill you I'm going to

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,439

46
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,600
you him let's try again wait so

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,880
Nick lost no

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,840
St that's just really like that that one

49
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,840

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,520
another one I

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:17,519

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,400
oh look look at look at the Yoke on oh I

54
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,160
didn't think it would explode like that

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,959
I just had to get revenge Nick all right

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,560
so it looks like we're going to try

57
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:34,840
again wait look at look at my at the

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,840
camer camera get the camera Matt get the

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,360
camera and it's like D look it's

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,680
dripping off the table I if I I can't

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,840
stand up it's going to drip egg

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,599
everywhere all right we're back three

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
new eggs one two we've cleaned up the

64
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,519
crime scene that was just in front of us

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,280
we have three new eggs so we're going to

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,519
create egg identity I to fully change

67
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,159
outfits and then after we cre yeah and

68
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,120
the now you can hear the washing machine

69
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
cuz the egg is being washed off of their

70
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,000
clothes okay a couple more rules I'm

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,879
going to go over while Matt and Chris I

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
identify their eggs like real children

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,280
you don't leave them alone cuz they

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,040
could kill themselves by accident they

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,680
could get killed they get kidnapped so

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,599
you're not allowed to leave your egg

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
completely alone for more than 10

78
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,000
minutes you have to have your egg in

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,879
your hand on your bed next to you with

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,519
you if you go out no matter where we go

81
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,480
The Only Exception is we're going to

82
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,040
have crib safe zones in the middle of

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,000
the night we're going to create a little

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,280
safe Zone we just have to keep our kid

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,640

that posum was dead serious going to

223
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,000
jump in the car Chris was like record it

224
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
so I pul my window down I reach to grab

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,800
the camera I looked to the left and it

226
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,519
was in the tree did you see it I really

227
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,640
hope it's on camera it was staring at me

228
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,640
the like

229
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,120
gelatinous what the like gelatin kind of

230
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,079
Sensation that egg gives I think is like

231
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,360
pushing the embryo

232
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,079
sack because Matt's egg is like

233
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,000
reforming like tell me there wasn't a

234
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,200
bigger dent in the car I think like the

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,640
the like the egg is like pushing back

236
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,240
the shell all right so one of the

237
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,640
challenges with your egg is you have to

238
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,640
wake up and change his diaper at what

239
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,800
time like 4:30 in the morning in the

language produced eggs normally take 72

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,800
hours before reaching your Supermarket

301
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,160
that's a good amount of time

302
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,720
wait so we're talking fresh out the

303
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,800
rooster but that's kind of that's kind

304
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,959
of insane Nick I like the Hat you wore

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,519
no bro it's got the hat it's

307
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,880
honestly kind of insane to think of the

308
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:01,279
fact that three days after being egged

309
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:06,079
what if like like how high are the odds

310
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,560
of like like if like Nick like a chick

311
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,639
mhm like what if you go to the grocery

312
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,160
store and then you go to like the egg

313
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,240
aisle and there's like 20 chicks running

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,360
around that's what I was going to say is

315
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,959
like what is the difference between

316
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
there is no difference we're eating baby

317
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,920
chickens M yep okay yeah so they're just

318
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,199
non-fertilized eggs thank you if an egg

319
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,160
has been fertilized the embryo begins to

320
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:31,560
develop within it it's worth noting that

321
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,560
the eggs we typically consume are not

322
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,120
fertilized but what is the difference

323
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,920
between can a sore bought egg become a

324
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,480
chick it's unlikely but not

325
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,120
impossible oh my God so wait how can you

326
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,160
visually tell the difference in between

327
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,440
a fertilized egg and an is there like a

328
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,199
tell or do you just have to know that

329
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,199
your chickens like haven't

330
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,920
 you know what I

331
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,040
mean Nick you're taking it too far I'm

332
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,240
asking the same question as you are I'm

333
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,600
just not afraid to use massive vocab

334
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,519
wait was Humpty Dumpty just a big egg it

335
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,720
takes 24 was he really mhm I thought he

336
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,759
was just like a fragile boy

337
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,320
M wait is Humpty Dumpty an egg actually

338
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,320
why did all along I thought Humpty

339
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,160
Dumpty like had some ties to being an

340
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,839
egg like in his name no but Humpty and

341
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,360
Dumpty don't both mean

342
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,160
egg in order to protect their children

343
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,279
from the horrifying aspects of the story

344
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,199
parents made the main character an egg

345
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,160
not a human I hate people make things

346
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:31,440
easier for kids it's like no yeah just

347
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,639
tell the kid he's going to die

348
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,920
if he falls off the wall correct he goes

349
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,959
up the hill right that's C in

350
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,959
jail yeah what's that smash or pass

351
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,639
Humpty Dumpty pass pass majorly that'd

352
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,160
be a fun video smash or pass like fairy

353
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,360
tal done that that's insane no we

354
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,720
haven't oh not fables but

355
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,959

him no

357
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,160
definitely definitely a chicken will lay

358
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,199
bigger and stronger eggs if you change

359
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,120
the lighting in a way to make her think

360
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,160
a day is 28 hours long that's kind of

361
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,759
sad why are we manipulating them

362
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,079
chickens can dream research has shown

363
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,880
that chickens experience RM rapid eye

364
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,199
movement while sleeping meaning they can

365
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,199
dream just like us what if a chicken has

366
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,120
sleep paralysis and his eyes open and

367
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,160
he's like asleep and he can't move and

368
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,759
in his like sleep paralysis demon is

369
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,560
just like a big chicken like running at

370
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,120
him like a big monstrous chicken

371
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,639
can you believe that like a chicken

372
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,360
could potentially have nightmares sleep

373
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,720
paralysis mhm mhm every pop like

374
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,959
what chickens are very intelligent

375
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,800
animals Studies have shown that chickens

376
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,199
are self-aware and can distinguish

377
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,440
themselves from the others they learn

378
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,000
from one another and they such as a

379
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
chick learning from her mother which

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,399
foods are good to eat chicken can also

381
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,639
demonstrate complex problem solving

382
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,959
skills a so they do definitely think

383
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,560
like in their head like oh my God

384
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,720
there's a rope right here I have to get

385
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,480
over this rope or like this fence like I

386
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
wish this fence wasn't here like they're

387
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,639
just thinking wait is it vegan to eat

388
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,120
egg no no no eggs it comes from chickens

389
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,839
no CH but that's like a healthy way you

390
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,120
can't eat milk or cheese but that's not

391
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,240
like animal being chopped up that's like

392
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,959
just like it came from the animal still

393
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,519
not that doesn't matter you can't even

394
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,839
wear certain coats I'm thinking a

395
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,759
vegetarian right vegetarian that a

396
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,399
vegetarian with vengeance to get you

both Focus up on this 4minute video what

433
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,159
what is going on hello Nick hello Chris

434
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,280
and hello everybody watching this video

435
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,200
I know that you might be confused on why

436
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,679
I am playing you this video in the

437
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,320
middle of an egg dad video but there is

438
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,880
very good reason and it's going to start

439
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,840
with the second I knew we were filming

440
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:48,000
this video you look like a like a like a

441
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,200
villain during the first drawing attempt

442
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,799
I knew I was not going to play fair I

443
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,559
was going to win this Challenge and I

444
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,280
was going to be the best dad of my egg

445
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,559
and I was going to let see my eggs a

446
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,720
phony be the bad dads that they are so

447
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,440
the second that they cracked the eggs I

448
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,320
went to the carton and I grabbed new

449
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,960
eggs but before that I also made sure

450
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,480
that there were two eggs that looked

451
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,039
extremely similar to theirs what I put

452
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,600
them at the bottom of the carton so I

453
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:19,080
knew which two to grab when I went into

454
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,919
my plan later in the day then when we

455
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,840
were taking the videos of the eggs to

456
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,280
put on the screen when Nick told you

457
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,200
whose egg was who I calculated that I

458
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,000
would be the one to record the eggs so

459
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,120
that I had an exact image of what their

460
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,120
eggs looked like at all

461
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,640
times shut up I so be quiet and watch I

462
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,880
am like be quiet and watch wait a second

463
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,280
wait a second I am like I am bamboo this

464
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,720
is the most Rogue mat thing I've ever

465
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,919
why is the most effort he's ever put

466
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,480
into anything in his life I calculated

467
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,760
that I would be the one to record the

468
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,360
eggs that I had an exact image of what

469
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,640
their eggs like at all times the next

470
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,640
thing I did was I am always BL to clean

471
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,720
up a mess so when I picked up the

472
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,960
Sharpies and put them back no quiet no

473
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,840
quiet I made sure to take the three that

474
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,679
I was going to need at the colors that

475
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,919
they used I brought them to my room and

476
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,919
I put them in my box lucky me I did not

477
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,320
do this on purpose but Chris got caught

478
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,640
by a pretty easy distraction of his

479
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,520
wallet being in the washing machine roll

480
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,720
the clip i a my shorts your wallet is in

481
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,280
your shorts I have a fear that it is no

482
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,919
I'll just leave it wow

483
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,120
wow

484
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,720
cooked with this now new knowledge I

485
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,880
knew that Chris would be way too focused

486
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,880
on his wallet and not on his egg while

487
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,559
me and Nick already had our eggs in our

488
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,679
pocket ready to go for the rest of the

489
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,360
challenge Chris was too busy seeing if

490
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,200
the tracker in his wallet got ruined by

491
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,200
the washing machine or not so he was on

492
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,799
his phone with him being on his phone it

493
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,480
struck the perfect opportunity right in

494
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,960
my nudely

495
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,039
drawn comp it to hiset Simply see that

496
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,600
they were a carbon copy and switch them

497
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,679
out and put the real egg in my pocket

498
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,640
Chris's egg was very easy to draw I just

499
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,440
had to make sure that the lines did not

500
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,279
pass the red line of his head and make

501
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,279
sure that his eyes

502
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,960
[Applause]

503
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:29,600
had watch

504
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,400
it you watch shut up

505
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,320
Nick was a good egg dad he sat there and

506
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,360
held his egg while watching TV and doing

507
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,880
everything that he was doing I knew that

508
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,240
he was going to be the problem and he

509
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
was going to be my biggest competition

510
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,919
Not only was Nick a very attentive

511
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,760
father to his egg but he did a good

512
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,600
drawing but the only thing that he was

513
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,279
missing was the fact that he was

514
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,720
smudging it all day long in the pocket

515
00:21:53,279 --> 00:22:00,120
out of the pocket so what did I do I

516
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,919
drew his egg perfectly carbon Cy then I

517
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,640
went to my bathroom and grabbed a face

518
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,960
cloth and I simulated the motion of

519
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,799
taking the egg out of the pocket over

520
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,120
and over and over again until I realized

521
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,480
that the smudges will match and mine is

522
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,120
honestly a little more bold than his

523
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,960
then as we were eating dinner and

524
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520
cleaning the table we decided to put all

525
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,640
of our eggs on the same plate Nick went

526
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,960
upstairs before dinner and that was the

527
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,159
perfect opportunity to go back into the

528
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,080
room compare the eggs make sure they

529
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,880
were close close enough and take his and

530
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,559
put it in my pocket and walk back to my

531
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,360
room now the hard part was done the

532
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,360
false eggs were put out into the world

533
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,679
and the real ones were in my possession

534
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,400
there were only two more things that I

535
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,320
had to do one of them it was gruesome it

536
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,360
was

537
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,360
evil but your eggs were my

538
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,240
breakfast no way you watching after

539
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,320
eating them they were very delicious but

540
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,039
the hardest part after that was just

541
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,799
making sure that you didn't fall for the

542

545
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,360
too caught up to even think about the

546
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,240
