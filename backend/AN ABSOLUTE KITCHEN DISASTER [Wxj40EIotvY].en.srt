or filmy white residue then it's a sign

116
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,520
that the salmon has spoiled it's so it's

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,199
spil you bought bad salmon Matt I didn't

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,320
think that it was bad it was on the

210
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,599
freaks me out well that means it was

211
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,240
already seasoned as well yeah what's

212
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,800

frightening Nick I'm really Ser well

222
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,880
guys this was here's the thing this was

223
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,680
supposed to eat it right out of the

224
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,200
package like it's like sushi or

225
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,959
something actually I think no way dude

226
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,240
what the [ __ ] dude I hate when I feel

227
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,920
like completely dumbfounded by something

228
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,320
that someone probably finds so simple at

229
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,000
all I know but Guys Smoke Zone is

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,240
already cooked so it needs no further

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,440
cooking yeah we understand that guys in

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,519
my defense smoked salmon it's already

233
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,920

234
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,680
my

235
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,360
defense um this was the only salmon in

236
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,360
the store at the at the time

237
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,360
um that's all I really have to say I

238
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,279
just can't believe not one of us used

239
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,800
our

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,519
brain I was just honestly focused on the

241
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,560
other groceries cuz I thought head chef

242
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,800
Matt had his recipe in me too I thought

243
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,760
Matt for sure knew what he was doing

244
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,760
wait that wasn't a bad bite really yeah

245
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm sure it's not bad this [ __ ]

246
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,880
is drowning in oil by the way this

247
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,760
asparagus I've learned let me get some

248
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,240
of that yeah this shit's fine I've

249
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,240
learned the type of salmon that I like

250
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,920
and this is not it I will eat it but

251
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,440
this will be this is a learning

252
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,560
experience for me I can't believe just

253
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,200
not want to stop you and I can now say

254
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,120
that that's just good though this was

255
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
our first failure wait that tastes good

256
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
Matt I know I'm eating it it's not a

257
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
failure it tastes good it actually

258
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,440

259
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,440

260
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,800

time okay that's the thing I knew here's

361
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,560
here's your problem mat tell me you

362
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,199
would have done fabulous if you didn't

363
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,959
buy the wrong salmon that was already

364
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,680
smoking but that's the thing I'm not

365
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,079
joking that was the only salmon in the

366
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,639
in yeah like we went to the salmon

367
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,199
Seafood section and it said salmon it

368
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,320
was right there it was too late at night

369
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,240
and there was none like that were

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,959
freshly cut so it was just those on the

371
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,519
shelf and I should have known by the

372
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,399
fact that there was none freshly cut

373
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,000
that I was doing something wrong but I

374
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,440
didn't know and I was hungry yeah then

375
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,440
you had he had a recipe for like a non

376
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
prepackaged salmon I had a recipe for

377
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,639
salmon you cook yeah and it was already

378
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,560
cooked this is embarrassing this is a

379
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,680
loss this is a lot for me to handle it

380
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,759
yeah I don't know how often our viewers

381
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,399
go to top golf but they have this thing

382
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:28,120
called Dirty Dr Pepper and as you know

383
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,120
we're we're big soda drinkers over here

384
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,680
and I think I found their secret recipe

385
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,759
so what we're going to try to do is

386
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,680
recreate the HP golf Dr Pepper all right

387
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,920
so it's basically Dr Pepper and then

388
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,480
coconut put some cubes in there we have

389
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,040
ice cubes we don't have ice cubes that's

390
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,880
so embarrassing that we're filling a

391
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,839
glass with soda with no ice we don't

392
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,440
have ice I know it's just embarrassing

393
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,560
well our fridge is

394
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,639
broken I just squirted the coconut cream

395
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,079
everywhere

396
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,120
oh this is is good

397
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,240
oh I could probably not kidding on a on

398
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,120
a really sad day drink this straight up

399
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,279
you want to know what I think we should

400
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,279
do you would I that's disgusting I

401
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,399
haven't been enjoying Dr Pepper as much

402
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,120
recently that's a lot of creamer yeah

403
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,040
you don't start storying oh I love that

404
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,639
it's bubbly hold on is it bubbling

405
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,759
bubbling I really think this is the

406
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,000
secret recipe too can you get out of

407
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,040
here with that spoon in there you just

408
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,920
told me to stir it with like a

409
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,800
straw it's like milk that looks gross

410
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
you can add a little more of this

411
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,360
yeah a little more of that all right

412
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800

giant boulder in the way that's still

469
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,720
the perfect path you just have to push

470

it out of the way that's a beautiful

471
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,240
statement thank you yeah the other the
