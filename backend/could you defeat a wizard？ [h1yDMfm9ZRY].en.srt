like 2 feet I think I I don't know I

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,719

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,399
range 2T range yeah like two 2.5 ft okay

51
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,840

52
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,560
like a beard they look super old

53
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,799
anything that's like half of my size I

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280

61
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,480

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,519
leprechaun is like kind of like in my

66
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,920
like the equivalent to like a rabid like

67
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,200
Angry animal like I feel like it would

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,080

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,080
in your gut like oh I could you know I'm

your stomach for seven years okay so

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,519
let's think if it's 15 sticks per pack

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:09,080
that's disgusting and you have 15 packs

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:13,200
that's disgusting 15 * 15 15 * 15 is

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,200
25 in an hour [ __ ] no stick that has to

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,959
be more than divide that by 60 okay I

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,920
could defeat it divide that by 60 two

85
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:26,560
what 250 225 divided 60 equals 3 3.75

86
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,599
pie of g a minute yeah [ __ ] no are you

353
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,240
run see the thing that's crazy to me is

354
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,279
they just did all the other [ __ ] too

355
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,480
they're FL they're flabber no they're

356
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,160
what's it called when you're drained of

357
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,279
energy flat famished no that's hungry

358
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,639
drained no it's not it's like I was

359
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,680
going to say flabber acid but it's not

360
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
it what is

361
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,839
fatigue fatigue Fue is the word that I'm

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,199
looking for fatigue sounds like a good

363
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,800
meal it sounds like yeah like an all

364
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,199
right I got two no it's no it fatigue

365
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,120
would be a bread you I could do the warp

366
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,360
Dall I had like a 100 fet of leeway I

367
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,199
can't believe they do it from like

368
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,279
they're getting no running start it's

369
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,759
like bro what you can jump 14 ft

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,360
essentially no you can't there's a wall

371
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,399
no but like they got like no running

372
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,120
starts like that's kind of impressive

373
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,800
they can't jump no three nights in the

374
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,240
woods

375
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
I wouldn't want to do it but I think I'd

376
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,560
survive unun easily survive you got to

377
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
like find your meals though I wouldn't

378
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
eat and I wouldn't do anything you don't

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
three days is nothing because all you

380
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,360
need is like maybe one day of like clean

381
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,959
water and at that point it doesn't I

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,519
just be starving and hungry and wait it

383
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,920

384
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,079
