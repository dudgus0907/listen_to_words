00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,760
hey guys what's going on the first thing

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,080
you're going to notice about this video

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,240
is Nick is in a different seat and

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,120
that's because you're about to have a

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,920
Monumental crash out if you had to sit

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
back there to today it wasn't going to

7
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,920
be a Monumental crash out I just get so

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,920
annoyed because we used to film in a

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,279
minivan that had a row of three back

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,800
there y or no the original original

11
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:24,560
original van OG OG was two seats but it

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,039
was far enough back and cushioned nice

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,279
and I was like I was comfortable I was

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
comfortable and I always feel like in in

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,879
our original when I look back I'm like

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,079
how the [ __ ] am I stationary in a car

17
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,800
but moving so much like I like I feel

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,440
like I had so much room to like to

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,320
gather around and like to just [ __ ]

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,640
really Frolic and let loose and now when

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,440
I sit in the back of this car I'm like

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,680
literally on the edge of my seat the

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,480
entire time I'm like my my tailbone and

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,199
like I feel it go half halfway up my

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,040
spine I feel numb no yeah numb

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,280

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,479
literally 3 minutes and like it's ins

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,960
turn those lights on my taint like

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,360
lights on in the back don't talk about

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,520
your burning taint never say that to me

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,640

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,680

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,159

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,320

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,439
digital the only thing that I regret my

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,079

digital footprint the only time I ever

41
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,000

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,119

really good that's something I've just

51
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,320

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,519

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,480
him like a a full basket I feel like I

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
was just reaching over so Nick Nick was

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,720
one of the only people at the table that

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,200
wanted to use ketchup and they got and

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,879
it was like the glass bottle that you

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,800
really got to just and you know you know

80
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,640
they ask you a bunch of this is it's

81
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,560
it's not even real people there's this

82
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,680
there's this philosophy I have of

83
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,440
function versus aesthetic yeah and those

84
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,480
glass godamn hindes ketchup bottles are

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,879
purely for Aesthetics cuz people think

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,319
they're coming out with this nice fancy

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,400
little glass [ __ ] ketchup bottle

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,840
thinking they're doing something that no

89
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,200
one's ever [ __ ] done before but how

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,239
do you know how convenient it is to

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
squeeze ketchup and have it squirt out

92
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,400
so basically the plate the plate is on

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
Earth I have a glass Coke bottle I'm

94
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,879
trying to get the plate is on Earth and

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,000
in order to get ketchup on the plate you

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,680
got to put the the ketchup to the moon

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,680
and then go

98
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,560
down and Nick's doing this and for those

99
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,000
of you that don't know on on this

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
channel or and that are new uh cuz I

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,560
think the last time I talked about it

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,480
was like a year and a half ago I have a

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,959
burning passion that I hate ketchup so

104
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,720
much and Nick's doing it and I'm seeing

105
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,000
the ketchup fall from the glass hit the

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,720
table and

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,720
disperse and this this lands on my shirt

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,360
ew This lands on my shirt you can barely

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,200
even see it I was about to have the

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,799
biggest crash out of my career in that

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
restaurant I grabbed the napkin and I

112
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,280
held it there like a shield in between

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,400
me and you held it together you didn't

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,600
yell at me did you were this close to

115
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,160
getting a smack across the face I was

116
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,840
like going like this like I was beating

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,560
when I get those do you know what I want

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
to do I want to take it just smash off

120
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,360
my head and then just pour the ketchup

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,960

if you always ate Lefty for some eating

159
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,600
habit is how you're going to get your

160
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,039
toes cut off one by one cuz you're

161
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,319
drinking a bunch of fake sugar from your

162
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,360
Pepsi cans and you've been doing it for

163
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,360
six years wrong and eating habit is a a

164
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,720
like a habit you have every time you go

165
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,880
to eat like if you were like oh I have

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,280
to have like a TP tucked in napkin and

167
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,600
like my Coke halfway empty to start

168
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
eating that's like an eating habit

169
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,840
both are correct I disagree your eating

170
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
habit can be what you eat and the

171
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,520
environment which you put yourself to

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,479
eat in I think you're think of the word

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,039
have aat thinking like I'm a tiger in a

174
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,080
Lily Pond eating [ __ ] meat wrong

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,479
eating you're like eating circumstances

176
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,199
Tigers would never in a Lily Pond you

177
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,160
have no [ __ ] clue where tigers would

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
be not in a how many times have you seen

179
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,319
a tiger in the wild and how many times

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,000
like all over his face this is all lies

245
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720

246
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,920
then a unicorn bursted through the room

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,760

248
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,640

your dream your dream what I was going

251
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,920
to say is Matt always thinks I'm [ __ ]

252
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,720
around when I'm I'm talking about like

253
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,120
the matte girls are going to love this

254
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Matt put these earrings in the other day

255
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,760
and he's wearing them right now and I

256
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,920
complimented Matt like 10 times and I

257
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,360
think we finally found Matt's best pair

258
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,160
of earrings in my opinion these like

259
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
thin cuz these are usually the earrings

260
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,560
I wear but Matt had these hoops and they

261
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
were really big so he's like Nick I'm

262
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
not going to wear those you can wear

263
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
them then I put these in and I like

264
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,920
these for me and these are like kind of

265
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,839

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,839
freely fly

376
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,760
it or was she I can actually answer that

377
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,399
yeah like I'm curious

378
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,360
so since it wasn't that windy but it was

379
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,240
relatively windy M they had some slack

380
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,519
built up and she was holding the kite

381
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
and he ran and then she threw the kite

382
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,600
and the wind took it up what was that a

383
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,360
trip it was kind of starting in like a

384
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,680
paper airplane fashion like she kind of

385
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,199

386
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,680

fun story that I have to share um the

416
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,880
other day I had to build up the courage

417
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,320
to ask an Uber driver to pull over for

418
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,320
me to pee that's a

419
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,240
nightmare that's like an actual Batman

420
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,959
for those of you that don't know the LA

421
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,360
fires burnt the Pacific Coast Highway

422
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,839
and you need to be a resident along the

423
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,160
highway to take the highway currently

424
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,360
because they're like working on it so

425
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,720
like they're minimizing the amount of

426
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,079
cars on it I am not a resident

427
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,639
in that direction so I was visiting a

428
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,319
friend I'm ubering and my ETA is like 30

429
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,040
minutes and then we can't get onto the

430
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:40,440
highway so my car ride doubles and I

431
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,079
already had to pee when we were a half

432
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,240
hour away so then I'm like [ __ ] what am

433
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,920
I going to do and I asked the driver and

434
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,279
he pulled over to A Whole Foods parking

435
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,600
lot we go to the back of the Whole Foods

436
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,680
together in the produce take an elevator

437
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,399

438
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,959
back to his car and then he drives me to

439
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,319
