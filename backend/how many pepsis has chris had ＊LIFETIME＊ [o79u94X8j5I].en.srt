because you hurt yourself funerals

73
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,580
somersaults somersaults what yeah I've

74
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,800
done seven summer results in a row as a

75
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,120
child I feel like

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,720
good old Summer's I used to somersault

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,459
down a hill literally straight down

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,220
so wait is it somersault vertical or

79
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,400
horizontal regardless you can't

80
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,159
somersault yeah

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,140
I'm talking about twist or twirl it's a

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,360
twirl it's really not twist that's a

83
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,900
roll oh a roll wait so what's a summer

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,480
song straight head first oh that's yeah

85
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,459
vertical yes that's the the vertical is

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,739
like this horizontal is like this in my

87
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,360
opinion like if you're laying down or

88
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,280
staying no standing up verticals up

89
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,379
straight jump whatever you want to say

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,420
horizontal Horizons where your goal is

91
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm good with yeah what was yours going

92
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,780
to the doctor because you like need

93
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,420
stitches like an emergency room visit

94
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,340
seven seven would be accurate for me

95
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,620
okay I think you win that

96
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,860
what was yours yours was crazy funerals

97
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,620
oh no great ones I think that's number

98
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,920
one really yes seven funerals was pretty

99
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,280
accurate all right I thought so I can oh

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,379
my ear is a really good spot right there

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,720

222
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,279
purple hose afterwards like it'd

223
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,279
literally be like the wrinkles

224
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:49,740
laughed at a child falling in public oh

225
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,720
my God one I have a suit oh three five

like 200 five but I really wanted 200.

228
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,060
well every time I'm talking to think how

229
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,220
many times have I seen like so okay

230
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,220
here's the problem you said that you hit

231
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,740
on 25 times in your life but you've

232
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,800
laughed at kids falling 200 times

233
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,940
correct there's no way I see little kids

234
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,860
full constantly I think it's the

235
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,420
funniest thing they have little buoyant

236
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,980
bodies like and they don't actually get

237
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,600
hurt like you know little kids are like

238
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,339
made a [ __ ] phone I think it's so

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,779
funny

240
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,000
little kids it's just unreal how little

241
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,560
kids if you feel after like a tumble or

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
something is solely off of other

243
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,240
people's reactions yeah like if you go

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
oh

245
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,940
out of their head and they will fully

246
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,860
just come yeah like if a baby gets you

247
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,279
can punch me like oh you're good look

248
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,279
man

249
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,839
especially when

250
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,160
like they're still okay you got everyone

251
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,740
around it's like

252
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,000
the baby's like

253
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,279
every single person looked at the baby

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,339
you have to assume the baby's A-Okay

255
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,660
yeah

256
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,980
fake it till you make it situation yeah

257
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,120
