talking about a normal conversation oh

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,400
and second grade I did a project on this

132
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,280
or like like like anything well I just

133
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,120
think I was a very Hands-On learner so a

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,479
project is where I soaked in most of my

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
information we posted we posted an

136
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,320
Instagram story that said if you had to

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,800
pick between blank or blank sorry sorry

138
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm so sorry

139
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,840
Mt I you never burp in the house well no

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
it's cuz I fuel up for the videos so I

141
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,479
dra a lot of Beverage we don't care

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
water water makes you burp if I drink a

143
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,160
whole thing in the second yeah we posted

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,919
an Instagram story that said if you had

145
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,800
to pick between blank or blank what

146
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,240
would you choose so

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,960
basically we give two examples music or

148
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
movies and you have to pick between

149
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,360
let's do it let's do it man uh music or

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,960
movies had to get if you pick one the

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,319
other one is gone forever I think that

152
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,120
music makes movies better when they have

153
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,280
like songs in movies yeah I was going to

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
say keep movies just because you can

155
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
like play a movie that has a good

156
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
soundtrack and like hear the songs in

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,319
the movie uh the I was going to say

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,199
songs are gone oh yeah I was going to

159
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,000
say it the total opposite way songs are

160
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,919
gone I was going to say if if I think

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,960
that there's some movies that songs make

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,039
the movie better then I think songs are

163
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:09,240
just more important of like a thing the

164
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,960

everything no I actually would hate to

255
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,480
have all that on yeah that's what I'm

256
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:53,320
saying that's like a die or live type of

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,959
one Tootsie Pop or Blow Pop Tootsie blow

258
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,959

out of the sea I love a ninja like a spy

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,800
like a like a pirates are way cooler

266
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,519
than ninja I strongly disagree I feel

267
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,240
more influenced by Pirates every day

268
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,200
than I ever have ninjas I agree because

269
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
ninjas are be being too stealthy to have

270
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
an a um uh effect on you that's why I'm

271
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,839
saying we don't need them if they're so

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,120
stealthy and they're like they only move

273
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,760
through Darkness it's like what do we

274
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,160
really need them for the Pirates have a

275
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
much more fun story but what are pirates

276
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,959

277
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,360
