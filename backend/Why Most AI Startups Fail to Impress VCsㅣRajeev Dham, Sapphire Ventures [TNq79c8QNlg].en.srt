1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,240
it's true that at least 50% of the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,280
pitches that we hear are AI every

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,599
vertical is being touched by both

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,040
software and AI but that doesn't mean

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,639
SAS is dead it's sort of why now what's

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,039
different why does the world need

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,600
another X what's the non AI part of your

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,640
product tackle something that's a new

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,640
problem area AI is not alone AI is not a

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,520
differentiator hey I'm reie Dom I'm I am

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,360
a general partner with sapphire Ventures

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,399
Sapphire is a growth stage software B2B

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,559
focused software investor we invest in

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,079
US Europe and Israel we're managing

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,200
over10 billion in capital partnering

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,760
with companies like LinkedIn exact

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,160
target DocuSign looker moft and more

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,960
recently companies like monday.com and

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,680
glean an Enterprise AI company I started

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,680
my career actually not as an investor

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,160
but an investment banker I worked for

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,719
Goldman Sachs actually in their

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,839
financial institutions Investment

24
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,400
Banking you know your primary role is to

25
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,119
advise companies on what you think they

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,720
should be doing in response to a

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,080
particular situation whether it be

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,360
evaluating m&a or going public or

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,520
raising some financing that's your job

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,400
as an investment banker But ultimately

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,439
even after a couple of years I realized

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
instead of advising these companies what

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,920
would it feel like to actually invest in

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,759
them and then help really advise them

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
from the board level having sort of some

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,720
skin in the game and chips on the table

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,520
of investing in companies that you're

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,600
really excited about there's a lot of

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,520
uncertainty but yet it's exciting

40
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,520
because these are growth markets you're

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,159
you're redefining a market or creating a

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,759
new market feel like I'm a kid in the

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,560
candy store and learning all the time

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,040
from entrepreneurs what they're building

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,960
why they're building it what's on the

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
come and it's just really exciting to

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,159
me on the market you want to make sure

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
there's a good Market size ideally you

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,759
want to make sure the company is an

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,119
emerging especially at our stage an

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,240
emerging leader or a Next Generation

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
leader one thing we see is category

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,280
leaders there's very few markets where

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,119
there's three or four players and

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,799
they're all roughly similar size often

56
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,080
times the category leader just sucks the

57
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,879
air uh out of a market because they

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
attract the best employees they attract

59
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,200
the best investors and the most amount

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
of capital they get the best customers

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,840
who tell other customers this is the

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
only game in town and they're lead just

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,879
compounds over time so we tend to look

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,440
at not just Market size but positioning

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,000
with that market one thing we're looking

66
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,120
at recently given the saturation in this

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,319
software and SAS space is sort of why

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
now what's different okay maybe there's

69
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,760
a company that has an AI angle and

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,319
that's going to create some accelerated

71
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,440
sort of growth over the long term but

72
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,800
what else is there's something

73
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,200
inflecting or something changing I like

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,000
to say what's the energy in the market

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,760
what is the end velocity in the market

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,519
you may have a big Market size but

77
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,000
everyone's happy with what they have and

78
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,159
it's going to be hard to go sell new

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,480
software into it what is the energy of

80
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,360
adopting a new software and companies

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,840
coming up for Renewal uh in that market

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,239
I think is critical even if your

83
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,239
business is scaling nicely taking a step

84
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,599
back and understanding the context in

85
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,120
the broader Market is there an

86
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,760
underlying Trend or inflection point or

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,560
a pocket in your competitive space or

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,159
Market space that might be more

89
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,879
interesting potentially and while your

90
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,200
company's going nicely now there's

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,959
another company or another pocket of the

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
market that can lead to even higher

93
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,840
growth we call it sort of missing out a

94
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,640
little bit on the wave I think that's

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
critical for some companies which is

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,480
incredibly hard to do when your

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
company's performing well and you want

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
to just stick to that l but I think it's

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,280
also important to understand that

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,360
broader context and I've seen that

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,159
multiple times where another company has

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
a slightly different twist or approach

103
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,560
is operating in a slightly different

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,680
segment or pocket of the market that has

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,720
more velocity and you can kind of take

106
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,239
off with the whole the whole prize one

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,360
thing I look for a lot and I talked to

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,920
customers about is velocity what's the

109
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,319
velocity of product improvements what is

110
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,200
the velocity of changes that maybe a CEO

111
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,879
or a c make on the go to market team how

112
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,799
quickly are those changes made how

113
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,239
decisive is this management team in

114
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,799
making changes there there's this saying

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm sure someone said it like grow fast

116
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,079
or die and I think that's kind of true

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,799
in startup world there's something about

118
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,280
the compounding nature of sort of

119
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,720
growing fast you almost have to hit that

120
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,280
escape velocity to make it out as a

121
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,199
startup and become some sort of

122
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,479
successful company CU if you don't the

123
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,160
sort of laws of gravity of private SAS

124
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,919
just sort of catch up to you and that's

125
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,880
hard and there's a lot of pressure there

126
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,039
becomes a lot of competition because

127
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
people see your company growing fast so

128
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,960
you got to just hit hit that escape

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,199
velocity I think this velocity of

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,479
decision- making that that you do across

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
product and go to market in an

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,360
organization what do you do when a

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,000
potential client says we love your

134
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,000
product but it's way too expensive do

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,240
you give in on discounts right away or

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,600
can you confidently defend your price hi

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm Peter on with over 15 years of sales

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,320
experience at companies like Google

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,120
Dropbox and Slack I'm obsessed over how

140
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,720
to effectively answer questions like

141
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,639
this in a way that builds trust that's

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,960
why I created Peter on sales school with

143
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,479

negotiation I walk through how you could

check out the link in the description or

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,360
find me at EO

158
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,880
School recent marketing conditions are

159
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,560
interesting is highly saturated with

160
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
hundreds if not thousands I think the

161
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,560
latest that was of rather large maybe 30

162
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,360
million to kind of 300 million ARR

163
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
enterprise software assas businesses

164
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,720
from infrastructures to application

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,520
businesses there's a plethora of them

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,039
that are out there in the private

167
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,960
markets every single category is

168
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,000
saturated and also getting funded by the

169
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,800
way at the very early stages so if

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,800
you're a Founder tackling something I

171
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,120
would say really push yourself to say

172
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,680
why does the world need another X or

173
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,680
tackle something that's a new problem

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,720
area tackle something that's you know

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,400
never been done before or in a vertical

176
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,840
that hasn't been touched before because

177
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,160
by the way the other Trend I'm seeing is

178
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,960
every vertical is being touched by both

179
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,240
software and AI now ask yourself the why

180
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,560
now why is this important why does the

181
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,880
world need another one of these

182
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,880
companies because ultimately investors

183
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,280
are looking for that as well what's the

184
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,639
difference in this narrative it's true

185
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,879
that at least 50% of the pitches that we

186
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,199
hear are AI already maybe even 60 70%

187
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,639
but that doesn't mean SAS is dead to me

188
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,560
those are still SAS companies AI is not

189
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,800
alone AI is not a differentiator it may

190
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,039
use AI as a technology enabler but it's

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,639
not AI is not the product AI is just a

192
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,360
small kind of piece of the product that

193
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,680
they're leveraging in really creative

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,440
ways like I said if AI is your full

195
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,120
product there's probably something wrong

196
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,639
and we probably won't invest you have to

197
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,280
have an approach of some non-ai

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
technology and Integrations workflows

199
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,360
that are are different in and around

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,680
that that I think are critical and so

201
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,680
that's that's what people are looking

202
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,720
for I invested in monday.com in 200

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,599
maybe 189 what was interesting to me

204
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,360
about monday.com was you had two

205
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,599
Founders in Iran and Roy who really just

206
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,840
had incredible conviction in their own

207
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:54,560
Direction and vision uh well one they

208
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,639
they presented to me and a group on my

209
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,919
colleagues and it was that night

210
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,199
actually I booked a red eyee over to Tel

211
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,000
Aviv flew out there to spend the whole

212
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
day with them and they were shocked and

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,080
surprised there was a plethora of

214
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,000
companies here in Silicon Valley that

215
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,919
were attacking the same Market with

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,919
maybe more interesting Silicon Valley

217
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,599
logos as customers but Monday and Roy

218
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,879
Iran just had a different way of doing

219
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,879
things I just saw that they just just

220
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,840
had true belief in their vision and it

221
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,720
was very well thought out why they would

222
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,879
succeed it was that founder sort of

223
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,440
conviction I saw that really left an

224
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,039
impression on me that was just really

225
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,639
unique in our time together I think

226
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
people sometimes don't quite get that

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,760
they think Road stage is just very

228
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,240
formulaic everything's sort of working

229
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,240
and you price the company and you try to

230
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,519
get money in there's still a lot that

231
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,360
has to work out even at later stages and

232
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,760
at monday.com there was a lot that still

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,240
had to work out but there's something

234
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,519
that excited me there's something that

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,360
stuck with me about that company and

236
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,560
about that meeting that leaves me that

237
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,760
energized to sleep 3 four hours a night

238
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,279
for multiple nights and to me that's now

239
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,600
become a signal I thought it was used to

240
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,240
be a flaw maybe it still is but now it's

241
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,440
a signal to me and that happened with

242
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Monday and that happened with many other

243
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
other businesses since our business is

244
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
pretty simple in some ways it's

245
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,320
investing in people you like and you

246
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,640
admire that just move you in some way I

247
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,399
think every investor needs to adapt to

248
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,279
the entrepreneur and founder that

249
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,200
they're working with I think if if a VC

250
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,480
is needing to operate the business

251
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
that's not really the entrepreneur that

252
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,160
a VC even wants to back in the first

253
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,240
place we want to back an entrepreneur

254
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,399
that says kind of get out of my way I

255
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,720
know what I'm doing here but hey can you

256
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,360
tell me how much I should compensate

257
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
this sales person and can you tell me

258
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,240
how many companies of yours operates in

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,200
three different distinct go to market

260
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
segments are there metrics or kpis can

261
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,560
you introduce me to a CTO and your

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
portfolio can you sit down with me talk

263
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,920
about usage based pricing models versus

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,040
seat-based pricing models and how that's

265
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,560
evolving across your portfolio or what

266
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,120
you think how would you think it appli

267
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,800
those are the questions that VC should

268
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,880
be there to answer versus going in

269
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,040
deeply and really trying to operate the

270
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,880
business dictate strategy too deeply uh

271
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,920
themselves so again I try to adapt to

272
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,800
the company and situation one thing I've

273
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,640
realized from glean to Mondays an

274
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,680
entrepreneur really wants to to walk

275
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,600
with you similarly as an investor and a

276
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,480
potential board member and just just

277
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,360
ensure that you really are bought in to

278
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,720
their Vision have true passion and

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,519
conviction for their companies I think

280
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,240
that's still um Paramount in terms of

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,959
you know winning a deal and figuring out

282
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,959
what you want to invest in
