39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Apes last night and we were like like I

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,360
was getting drinks from the bottom shelf

41
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,840
of a fridge and I felt like one of the

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,280
Apes because I was like I didn't bend my

43
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,439
knees at all but I put my entire like

44
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,000
hips and up bent over like but my legs

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,079
were perfectly straight like I've never

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,119
been able to touch my feet standing up

47
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,439
straight but I think I did it I think I

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,360
did it getting food last night last

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,119
night I had Nick text me this cuz I was

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,439
like no way you just said this this is a

51
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,000
quote from Nick the second he laid down

52
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,479
in bed next to me last night after all

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,880
those eight movies I just want to drag

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,520
my Knuckles on the ground do you know

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,360
what I mean though I do like I'm like

56
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,240
they're going through rough terrain

57
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,560
constantly with their bare knuckles in

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,079
the ground like I don't feel like I'm

59
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,399
getting somewhere unless I feel the

60
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,599
gravel on my Knuckles like that's how I

61
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,319
know I'm I want to like I want to just

62
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,440
climb a mountain going to start going

63
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,040
somewhere he's going to get there and

64
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,000
he's going to go I I just want to like

65
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,400
drag my fist on okay this is what I I

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
watched the movie and then I thought

67
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,840
this to myself and I was like you know

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
what we have to film a car video soon

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,080
I'll save it I wrote down and it's a

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
full paragraph after watching Planet of

71
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,760
the Apes and seeing the monkeys drag

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,160
their Knuckles on the ground and how

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,760
they don't speak unless super provoked

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
to speak you know what I mean I think we

75
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,959
should speak to each other and

76
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,760
communicate via like a side eye or a

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,080
nudge but only yell or speak in like

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,519
demanding words or phrases like if we

79
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,080
limited our speech in a day to like if I

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,640
needed something I was just like Matt

81
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,560
like or like like side eyes and like

82
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,879
phrases and stuff and then like after

83
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,760
like three hours not talking I was like

84
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,519
you did that I was like no snacks I fear

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,560
dinner like just random like aggressive

86
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,920
words I fear that's how I live my life

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,200
yeah it is that does do that he only

88
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,159
speaks if like super provoke especially

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,879
first thing in the morning when we're

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,959
getting ready to go somewhere you're

91
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,720

get to the car and we're already going

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,280
somewhere I'm like Hello nice to see you

106
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,159
um speaking of me not being able to see

107
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,040
the TV I genuinely believe if I went to

108
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,720
the eye doctors today and they said like

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
if I went to the eye doctors today

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,560
they'd prescribe me contacts for daily

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,079
use you said this like probably I can't

112
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,599
read anything that's why go can you go

113
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,040
and get the things I have to I'll be

114
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,160
drive if I drove down a street and the

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,160
sign was like like you know how signs

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,000
usually like the the color matches the

117
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,759
vibe like yield is definitely yellow

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,120
stop is definitely like red like hold

119
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,280
off what yield signs are not yellow what

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,080
they definitely are Google definitely

121
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,840
are they definitely are Mr driver take a

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,680
Google search no it's a it's a red

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,280
outline with a white triangle that says

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,039
yield in Black East Coast yield sign no

125
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,880
but anyways no what I was saying is like

126
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,639
there could be a sign that says like

127
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,520
extreme danger do not enter and I'd have

128
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,039
to like get really close to it to see

129
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,280
like I'd be in danger by the time I read

130
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,320
the sign which is oh yeah when I'm

131
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,039
driving by the danger low clearance and

132
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,520
you only read danger the other day oh my

133
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,160
God we were on the way there was a

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,600
tunnel and like it's a it said

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,759
like the direction M was going it's a

136
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,759
danger so I looked I looked up and I

137
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800
said danger he was like shut up I'm

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,520
giving them perspective you know how

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,600
when you drive through a drive-thru and

140
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,160
it's or like yeah a drivethru is the

141
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,319
perfect example and above it says like

142
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,080
clearance 9 ft like can't take a semiu

143
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,039
correct there's one of those under a

144
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,120
tunnel because the tunnel we headed into

145
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
Boston and it was a sign that literally

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,280
said d

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,840
clear I danger was more bold on the

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,120
thing danger and I thought mat was going

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,479
on the offramp of a highway yeah and he

150
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,000
started freaking out back there and he's

151
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,240
like Matt you're driving into danger

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,960
stop stop and we're like all like yeah

153
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,880
but then Chris tried to Gaslight me

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,520
Chris did gas he goes he read just the

155
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,080
low clearance and he goes Nick the sign

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,960
doesn't even say danger I didn't read

157
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,319
anything I just new with my head I see a

158
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
big pole I'm like assuming it's a

159
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,600
clearance thing yeah but he goes Nick it

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,440
didn't even say Danger did say danger in

161
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,720

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,880
should just shut your

166
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,440
mouth in my opinion that's fine what

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,199
about when I saved you from murdering a

168
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,840
bicyclist the other day then you can

170
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,560
pedestrian if it's not important first

171
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,199
of all it was the Biker's fault no not

172
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,759
no it was not cuz you almost hit him

173
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,160

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,720
would

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,680
have side of the front not really kind

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,599

186
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,199

memorize her name because of her ID and

193
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,560
we like use her name on a regular we use

194
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
her name as a [ __ ] adjective or a

195
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,680

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,279
that if if I knew that I wouldn't be an

259
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,160
alcoholic I'd be such a fun casual drunk

260
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,320

261
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,240
alcoholic in one second okay for our

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,240

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,040
the internet comment what would be our

266
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,760
favorite drink you're weird where would

267
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,760
be your nightmare place to get blacked

268
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
out drunk for the first time like your

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,240

271
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,800

273
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,279

275
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,720
think when people say wait hold on do

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,959
you think people that drive by like I

277
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,360
always do they gota like they got to

278
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,320
look over and be like why

279
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,200
that whole car fully illuminated yeah in

280
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
the camera they got to know what we're

281
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,040
doing though right filming a por do you

282
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
think when a [ __ ] says that we

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,920
like look alike they think they're like

284
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,160
the first person to do it 100% like when

285
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,399
someone comments they're like Nick looks

286
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,320
like Matt Matt looks like

287
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,399
Nick well yeah I do I think like the

288
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,519
people I think people make triplet jokes

289
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,120
and they think that they're so original

290
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,200
but they don't realize I've Pro I

291
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,560
probably heard that for the first time

292
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,440
when I was six there's a [ __ ] rat

293
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,560
right there look at it I think Tik talk

294
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,000
just the app and being chronically

295
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,639
internet has ruined normal

296
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,040
moments for people I said like why am I

297
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,399
seeing at least two people dead and two

for me I'm dead serious listen it's like

366
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,240
I think the text just gets so confusing

367
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,160
and I'm like sometimes I need just pick

368
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,639
up the phone and talk to this person

369
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,199
right cuz I'm like I just need to talk

370
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,440
and get my point across right and then

371
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,480

375
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,279
like if I delete all these apps and I

376
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,240
start like just calling people when I

377
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,120
need them and not like texting or

378
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,920

379
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,199

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,880

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,759
name a song that we want to get edited

387
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,279
to this is the most chronically internet

388
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,680
thing this is bad this is bad and then

389
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,880
we each get like 10 seconds to pose and

390
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,199
like do your one like big one like for

391
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,199

392
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,720
like I say my song like I say my song

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,279
I'm like okay Airbnb by Ian right now

394
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,759
now you say a song and then you say his

395
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,800
song and then whoever gets the hardest

396
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:01,040
edit after this video wins I think I'd

397
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,040
rather shoot myself in the face

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,560
know what I

399
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,279
mean I think I'd rather just like I

400
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,759
think it's like crazy to turn it into

401
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,399
like a CL you've said like an like oh

402
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,920

404
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,920
don't you don't like all right all right

405
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,800
let's all right let's each pick a song

406
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,199
for this video who was I with one time

407
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm giving who was I with one time and I

408
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,000
had this Skittles Littles thing and I

409
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,839
went like this and they and they like

410
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,600
had like a flashback do you remember

411
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,360
that who was I with you guys no idea I

412
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
was with a friend I I'm like totally

413
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,360
forgetting who it was right now and I

414
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
really wish I remembered but I was with

415
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,040
a friend and I went like this and they

416
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,720
were like oh my God and I was like what

417
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,800
and like that exact noise is like the

418
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,399
scariest point in like a horror movie

419
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,319
that they had like recently seen and

420
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,279
they were like don't do it again my

421
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,720
favorite thing ever to do is Express

422
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,360
like an extreme amount of emotion or

423
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,959
aggression toward one topic and then

424
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,040
when someone like confronts me about it

425
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,079
being like I don't really care yeah I

426
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,360
agree like I love doing that like is

427
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,160
being like super strongly speaking about

428
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,959
something I really don't I don't care

429
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,600
yeah I don't care yeah what's the time

430
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,360
where you are Troy ofan why would I say

431
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,079
a song that I want them to edit me to I

432
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,360
think he just showed them he just showed

433
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,639
them you would never say like for

434
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:23,319
example like you'd never say like [ __ ]

435
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,800
Power by like future yeah it's terrible

436
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,839
G I took a good guess that like go of

437
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,839
the raapers you know Nick would we be

438
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,319
friends if I wasn't your brother [ __ ] no

439
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,160

like moveed it if I had a hair on me

443
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,480
that whole time and you altered it in

444
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,600
the beginning I'm going to shoot you oh

445
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,360

448
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,160

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,440
this girl is on Tik Tok and and she I

450
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,759
just found her she does the videos like

451
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,240
ideas for the stola triplets you know

452
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,160
what I'm talking about you just found

453
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,480
how would I know what you're talking

454
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,959
about you might know already I don't

455
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,360
know if you've seen it I've seen I've

456
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,000
seen nothing on the Internet it's so

457
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,959
funny though but okay so listen we just

458
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,799
I just want to clar I want to clarify

459
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,079
this and this this alone quickly a lot

460
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,559
of people whenever we post like the

461
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,120
stories on Instagram like oh help us

462
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,640
with video ideas that's something we've

463
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,720
been doing since the start of our career

464
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,720
and when we had no fans way at the

465
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,600
beginning and only like 30 people were

466
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,000
responding they were coming up like with

467
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,600
insanely creative ideas so it was always

468
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,240
something we continued to do was ask

469
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,360
fans for um advice on content or what

470
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,760
they want to see us talk about or ideas

471
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,840
but it's gotten to the point of

472
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,320
popularity of us on the internet where a

473
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,799
good majority of the responses are good

474
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,840
but a vast majority of them are like um

475
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,200
hi who's going to sleep with me um I

476
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,840
love you guys so much can you come to my

477
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,600
graduation party my mom and dad are

478
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,960
getting a divorce blah blah blah all

479
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,520
this all this crazy [ __ ] so there's just

480
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,559
like not a lot that we can talk about

481
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,440
but when people post videos of

482
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,120
themselves giving us video ideas or

483
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,679
topics they're not going to post

484
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,600
themselves saying crazy [ __ ] so they're

485
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,360
usually way better which leads me to

486
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,240
this fan had questions for us and we're

487
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,720
going to answer them and if you guys

488
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,400
post good questions on Tik Tok we may

489
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,240
possibly respond to them in a video one

490
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
day in the future I'm so curious for her

491
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,400
question they're really good Nick was

492
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,720
show me the other day okay if there was

493
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,760
a ster University what would the mascot

494
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,919
in colors be and what classes would be

495
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,440
taught there ooh that's a really good I

496
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,760
do kind of feel like we should wait I do

497
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,240
feel like we should kind of wait till

498
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,919
next video yeah cuz then we could maybe

499
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,320
see other people's responses are and I

500
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,600
feel like I could go on like longer

501
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,080
tangents we've already filmed for so

502
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,039
long well shout out her that was a good

503
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,280
question okay yeah we'll we'll answer

504
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,919
that next video yeah we're going to

505
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,200
answer that and do other stuff next me

506
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,440
alive hate to say it again bring it up

507
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,159
again but if we do cut out Wednesday

508
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
videos and I know we bring that up every

509
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,880
video no I know we bring it up every

510
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,720
video to the point where it's like

511
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,000
annoying now but it's like we've

512
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,240
seriously been contemplating this and

513
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,200
the reason we bring it up so much is

514
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,559
it's been a year of our or two years of

515
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,240
our life where we've been posting two

516
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,960
videos a week I just want to make it

517
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,600
clear to everyone that it wouldn't be

518
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,000
like eliminating car videos or

519
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,159
eliminating Vlogs it would simply be

520
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,280
like it would just be like random and

521
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,760
who knows what we're going to do you

522
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,640
guys always bring up um pretty good

523
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,640
points and I do think that I wouldn't be

524
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,320
opposed to a break as opposed to cutting

525
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
them out so we'll just see what happens

526
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,360
no my thing is we're never going to not

527
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
be on the internet and sharing content

528
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,240
to yeah a lot of people constantly talk

529
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,840
about like us quitting which is never

530
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,679
going to happen cuz the internet is our

531
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,039
just more of like it's just more of like

532
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,240
we kind of hit a wall where it's like if

533
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,440
we're if I'm sleeping until 2: and then

534
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,600
doing nothing at home the Vlog is not

535
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,480
going to be interesting come Wednesday

536
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,799
because I sat at home on my [ __ ] ass

537
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,679
all day but it's not even that it's

538
