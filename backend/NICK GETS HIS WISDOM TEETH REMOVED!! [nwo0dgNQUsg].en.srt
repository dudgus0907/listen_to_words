43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,399
to

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,000
sleep right for the first time in my

45
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,159
life I don't want to do it so I have

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,640
zero [ __ ] sleep and in order for the

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
anesthesia to work you want to know what

48
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,799
you can't eat 12 hours before the

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,320
procedure I woke up at 4 [ __ ] p.m.

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,439
yesterday and I had to cut off my time

51
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,840
of eating at 1 p.m. do you know how much

52
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,719
I eat do you know how much I eat at

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,319
dusk I also yeah I also couldn't drink a

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,759
[ __ ] thing past 10 p.m. so you're

55
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,480
thirsty and hungry which is like it

56
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,760
makes sense yeah cuz the anesthesia has

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,400
to work but I'm [ __ ] starving I'm

58
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,239
thirsty all I wanted last night was a

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,160
[ __ ] lemonade and we have a fridge

60
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,200
full and I can't I can't have a [ __ ]

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,640
n want a lemonade so bad we have like a

62
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,480
ton of lyrical lemonade it's hilarious

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,480
[ __ ] pisses me off I just can't

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,239
believe this is happening to me here do

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
you want to know my process I've been

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
thinking about it a lot and I'm like wow

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,879
I'm so happy that it's Nick getting

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,519
sated and not me this morning so

69
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,800
basically what I was thinking is like

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
whenever I have like tried like like

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,720
horrible things that I have to do in the

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,760
near future or like something I don't

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,280
want to do I'm just going to pretend

74
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,760
that it's you or Matt that have to deal

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,519
with it and then just be totally

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,560
blindsided when it's me like be like

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
wait it's me that has to get sedated in

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,879
my Wiz te Bel so like if I were you I

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,280
would just pretend that it's actually me

80
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,720
and then it's not going to [ __ ] work

81
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,440
it would work flawlessly and then just

82
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,680
get there that seems like a horrible

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,680
idea how are you feeling upset and

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
annoyed

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,280
a last night I couldn't sleep at all cuz

86
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,959
of how nervous I was and literally just

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,400

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,560
my arm my whole arm has just been numb

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,319

when you have your wisdom teeth out they

143
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,919
give you four fake teeth to put under

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
for the tooth fairy but like the Tooth

145
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,680
Fairy knows the whole gist what yeah she

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
gets it cuz but she needs the real teeth

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,000
not

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,080
for no it's not not for wisdom teeth

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,039
wisdom teeth is like a okay that's like

150
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,800

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,840
fake wisdom teeth that the dentist gives

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,960
