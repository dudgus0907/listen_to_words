1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
There is this sort of psychological

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,200
fallacy as a founder where at one point

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,120
your logical brain needs to be switched

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
off because obviously you're working on

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,719
a problem that nobody else sees. I was

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,400
working on the proof of existence

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,560
protocol where we worked with an

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,960
Ethereum node and I told people that I

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
believe in a world where there will be

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
100,000 nodes that will be run by

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
institutions by 2020. That's what I

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
said. And people were laughing at me. I

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
knew one thing for certain that if I

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
hold on and deliver this, it'll be a

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
massive win. And when I told other

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,040
people about it, they didn't believe it

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
at all. They were telling me we won't do

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,719
that. And then Block Demon itself now

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,280
runs 250,000 nodes, you know, and so you

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,840
need to be stupid enough to also hold on

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,840
to an idea that most smart people around

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
you will tell you is a very bad idea.

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,399
I'm Constantine Richtor. I'm the founder

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,400
and CEO of Blog Demon. Blockdemon is the

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,240
leading institutional gateway for

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,720
institutions to connect to really

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,200
blockchains and the web 3 ecosystem. And

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,680
so we're one of the market leaders and

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,159
staples of the crypto industry that it

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
has JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and City

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,680
Bank as investors and customers. Out of

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,400
the top 500 companies active in crypto,

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
70% are customers of block demon for

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,360
infrastructure. Ultimately, what we do

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,159
is the purest form of infrastructure we

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
run in a decentralized network. One easy

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
way to think about it is that the

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,759
internet ultimately functions via

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,759
different gateways and so do

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,640
blockchains. And so one way I used to

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,600
describe blockchains to people was you

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
have ultimately nodes. A node are the

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,159
different members of the network that

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,479
contain a copy of the ledger. Nodes are

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
actually like cell towers. It's these

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,799
groupings of individual ledgers that

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,600
make a blockchain. And Block Demon

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,040
manages the individual ledgers. We

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,600
basically run these cell towers for

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,920
blockchains for institutions. We assume

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,399
that we run around 10% of the global

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,560
institutional volume of nodes around the

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,760
world. Block Demon has raised around

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,959
$430 million. The last valuation we've

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,959
had was $3.3

56
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,120
billion. One memory I always have is

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,520
when the wall came down in Germany. I

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,319
was a teenager at the time. I remember

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,840
the cold war ending when the world

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,920
somehow got a lot closer and also in the

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
context of the history of Germany from

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,480
the second world war being very aware

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,360
that it's important to have systems that

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,040
are uncorruptible in order to establish

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,040
truth. And so I remember that time as a

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
really important moment to think about

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,879
how do we become closer as humanity? How

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,280
do we communicate and then how do we

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,080
ensure that the forms of communications

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,480
are uncorruptible. What I found really

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,440
exciting about Bitcoin specifically was

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,159
one the immaculate conception story of

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,800
Satoshi ultimately a value system that

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,640
basically gets birthed by itself and

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,959
then the people who can control it

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,879
vanish in the background and leave it

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
for the community. And I like the

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,280
encryption and a little bit the sort of

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,680
hackery nature of it. I did like that it

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,519
was a currency of the underdog. Bitcoin

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
was started as a result to the financial

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,519
crisis in 2008. And the whole idea was

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,319
to basically take control of money away

84
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,640
from banks into a system that's

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,680
transparent and fair and accessible to

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
anyone. And um that excited me and I

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,200
felt I can actually contribute to it

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
because I know how to build and scale

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,280
software companies and I know how to

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,280
corral capital together to work on

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
succinct problems and belief is

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
important. I believed Bitcoin is one way

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
to make the world better, but you also

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
have to be an active part in creating

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,080
that world. I didn't just want to make

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
money. I also wanted to change the world

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
a little bit. And I understand there's

98
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,439
also lots of concerns and some of it

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
might be bad, some of it might be good,

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,439
but the system in itself I really hold

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,599
very dearly. And so I was thinking what

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,840
company in cryptocurrency can you build

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,159
that is part of it but not so

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,479
susceptible to the short-term velocity

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,720
of tokens. And so that's why we started

106
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,720
with

107
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,759
infrastructure when I was working on the

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,919
proof of existence protocol where we

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
worked with an Ethereum node and saw

110
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
that the physical node and

111
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,680
infrastructure was very unstable and

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
there weren't any tools available. When

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,720
I started researching that subject and

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,720
talking to my friends about it, I saw an

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,560
opportunity and I got really excited

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,080
about it. You know, it feels so great

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,240
when you see a gap in the current

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
product landscape. What was very

119
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
apparent was like you couldn't go

120
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,479
anywhere online and say, "Hey, is there

121
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
a tool that helps me to run an Ethereum

122
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
node really efficiently? Okay, if this

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,560
is hard for us people who are really

124
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,880
passionate about crypto and blockchain,

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,040
how are institutions and banks going to

126
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,360
engage in this if there's no tooling,

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,680
nothing available?" What I saw is a

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,639
world in which institutions would want

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
to run these Ethereum nodes. And when I

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,880
told other people about it, they didn't

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,120
believe it at all. They were telling me

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,440
we won't do that. But the more I learned

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,800
about the structure of transactions, the

134
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,280
cost of transactions, the more I saw the

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,440
future in which blockchains become an

136
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
integral part at this, I knew one thing

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,479
for certain that if I hold on and

138
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,800
deliver this, it'll be a massive win. I

139
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,720
believed in the vision of the company to

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
a point where nobody else believed it

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
because obviously you're working on a

142
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,560
problem that nobody else sees. I think

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
that's the resilient part is then to

144
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
continue to work on it while people are

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
telling you this is not a problem. Why

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,919
are you working on this? I remember

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,000
raising money in 2017 2018. I told

148
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,360
people that I believe in a world where

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,320
there will be 100,000 nodes that will be

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,080
run by institutions by 2020. That's what

151
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,600
I said. and people were laughing at me.

152
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,080
And then Block Demon itself now runs

153
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,199
250,000 nodes. Uh you need to be stupid

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,280
enough to also hold on to an idea that

155
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,479
most smart people around you will tell

156
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,479
you is a very bad idea.

157
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,680
Within 6 months of starting the company,

158
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,840
the markets of crypto fell down a cliff

159
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
which we call the crypto winter which is

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,919
like when the tokens that drive a lot of

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
the momentum in blockchain suddenly

162
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,800
devalue by like 80 90%. Everybody

163
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,039
stopped investing. Banks started

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
exploding. We had two banks at the time.

165
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,520
One bank went bankrupt and so a lot of

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,759
the inherent growth for the business

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,000
dried up right when I started the

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,919
company. You know, quite frankly, at

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
that point in time, everything was so

170
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,639
bad. We ran out of money a few times.

171
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
Uh, I had to subsidize payroll, for

172
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,000
example. The only way for Block Demon to

173
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,479
survive is if I put in everything I have

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,080
without a clear promise of a better

175
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,639
market environment, and I just have to

176
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,400
make it last as long as I can with as

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,479
much output as I can. And so there were

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,720
a lot of moments where it felt like wow

179
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,680
I don't really have a believable path

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
forward but still I have to convince

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,199
people that there is one. As an

182
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
entrepreneur that's your job ultimately

183
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
you have to find resources where other

184
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
people can't. You have to keep people

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,960
motivated and inspired when uh it looks

186
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,759
very bleak and uh you just have to keep

187
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,759
on leading by example.

[Music]

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,880
The first one was block demon was very

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
small. I think the second time around

191
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,639
was unique because at that point we

192
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,479
raised a lot of money. So we had a lot

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,440
of capital. What was difficult is that

194
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,520
we started 2022 by raising a lot of

195
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,000
money buying companies to build a sort

196
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,800
of really cohesive product suite that we

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,199
thought we could sell within the year to

198
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,080
institutions. And what happened is that

199
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,879
market just died. There was suddenly a

200
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,680
lot of pressure on ultimately scaling

201
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,599
down the projects we worked on that

202
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,759
created operational pressure on the

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,319
company to how do we rightsize the

204
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
company? How do we losing money in

205
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
developing products that currently have

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,120
no market? It was a lot harder because

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,120
we had to make the hard choice to also

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
let go of a lot of block demons and

209
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
people that worked with us in order to

210
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,319
um ultimately be operational efficient.

211
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,360
changing strategies and letting go of

212
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,080
people in order to adjust for a longer

213
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,120
period of time without any growth of a

214
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,000
more mature company. And so I'd say that

215
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,360
crypto winter felt harder to me because

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,680
obviously um losing people from your

217
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
team because of that is really really

218
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,480
hard. The way I describe it to people,

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,399
it actually just felt like another

220
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,920
Wednesday. You just take it on the chin

221
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,600
and are like, "Okay, now I need to solve

222
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,760
this problem." So you have to maintain

223
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,519
an illusion of um competence and vision

224
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
where like hey this is not a problem.

225
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,480
This is just a little bump on the road.

226
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
I know exactly how we're going to solve

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,200
it. It's challenging because as a

228
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,839
founder you know that a lot of the plans

229
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,440
and thoughts I had very early on are

230
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
assumptions. I don't know if they're

231
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,760
right or wrong but I have to pretend I

232
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,720
do. But you know I mean like anything

233
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,480
else you just try to not tell yourself

234
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,279
it's so bad and you just keep moving.

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,120
and we found solutions for it. You know,

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,640
um having a really strong team and

237
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,320
people who uh have good integrity is

238
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,240
really important in moments like that.

239
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
And I'm very lucky that I do have a

240
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,880
great team and people who stuck it out

241
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,880
with me

242
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,760
basically in a world where it's so hard

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,160
for us to develop consensus between

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,279
human beings when news and social media

245
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,440
and everything is so um polarized and

246
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,320
it's hard to know what's true and what's

247
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,360
not that systems that are I want to air

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,000
quote infallible and always true are

249
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
really important. When the internet was

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,360
created, people scammed people on the

251
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,959
internet. I never thought the internet

252
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839
shouldn't exist. I thought there should

253
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,760
be regulation and rules and education to

254
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
protect people from scammers, but that

255
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,320
the benefit of the technology of open

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,279
access and trade outweighs the downside.

257
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,800
If done correctly, crypto is the

258
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,959
antithesis to scamming. It's fully

259
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
transparent. It's traceable. You can see

260
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,160
every wallet that's active on the

261
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,440
network. And so it's actually the most

262
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,240
scam resilient system at its core. I

263
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,880
think it took us 3 years before

264
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,200
institutions started engaging with us in

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,800
order to engage with institutions. I

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
think we also made the decision at the

267
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,720
time that the only way institutions are

268
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,120
going to engage with us is if they also

269
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,120
own part of blockdemon are part of the

270
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,040
governance of block demon. And so JP

271
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,040
Morgan and Goldman Sachs for example

272
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,120
have uh participate in the board of

273
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,440
blockdemon. So they're basically also my

274
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
bosses which means that they get to see

275
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,920
the inside of the company. They get to

276
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,640
question my choices. They're not just

277
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
outside customers. They also in are

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,240
parts of creating the company. And so I

279
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,920
think that gave them a lot of

280
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,279
confidence, right? And so that was an

281
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,680
important initial step for the first

282
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,079
customers. And the US has uh started to

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,680
look very very different than it did in

284
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,360
2024. We see a huge shift that's uh

285
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
materializing very quickly. The

286
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,399
landscape of crypto will look really

287
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,800
really different in the US with a lot

288
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,079
more enterprises and institutions

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,399
actively launching services uh for their

290
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,880
respective customers around crypto. Uh I

291
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,560
think in a complicated convoluted world

292
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,640
that we live in transparency and

293
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,200
efficiency are really really important.

294
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,519
They're not a luxury. They're

295
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,519
requirement for fair governance and

296
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,839
efficiency. And so I think it is indeed

297
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,200
a golden age for cryptocurrencies. Yes,

298
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,800
I've seen it from it being the underdog

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,040
to now becoming basically the not the

300
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
main dog, but the standard, right? And

301
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,440
so I think we're halfway there. And it's

302
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,040
so exciting to be a fundamental part of

303
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,040
something that I want to see it through.
