just standing there waving it's yellow

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,540
thing like we don't need to see that

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,959
anyway Nick can go first oh my God I got

65
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,940
my biggest ear Nick say it say it I feel

66
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,160
like one of my bed Nick's not gonna want

67
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,080
this one in the video go

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,099
when Nick gets out of the shower and

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,099
walks around the house

70
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,560
they don't pull it up that high I guess

71
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,659
you do bro I actually everything and I'm

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,640
just like oh my God that's your own

73
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,980
fault because it's like I'm wearing I'm

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,620
casually wearing large underwear that

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,420
fits me well incorrect I just like to be

76
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,220
secure and that's your problem it's like

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,379
to hang loose and that's not my I do

78
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
like the Hang lows so whatever I just

79
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,260
think if you're gonna wanna if you want

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
to keep it tight then wear some pants

81
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,159
you know amen we don't want to know we

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
all don't want to keep it tight yeah

83
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,480
it's like you guys complain but it's not

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,879
like I I'm never the Casual sitting

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,099
around underwear wear wearer I always am

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,040
going straight to my room to put pants

87
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,560
on no no no no no the sight of my

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,239
traveling to my room to get clothes no

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,799
because sometimes you just stand there

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,560
and start different activities in your

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
underwear right not true yes I don't

92
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,799
spend more than five minutes in just

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,580
underwear

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,019
like 10 maybe like ever I don't know but

95
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,760
even when I'm like sleeping in your room

96
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm just like wow like

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,439
I think you just need to invest in

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,140
better fitting underwear investing and

99
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,060
putting some pants on what this is this

100
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,280
one's actually not about either of you

101
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,739
well that's the point of the video well

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,560
shut the [ __ ] up okay I think my biggest

103
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,660
ick is the fact that people have turned

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,040
the word ick into pet peeve like these

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,440
are all just pet peeves this isn't like

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,759
an ick and ick is like a different thing

107
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,340
you know do you have any do you have any

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,259
like relevant things to say wow okay I

109
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,180
have one written down actually go ahead

110
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,400
let me go find it

111
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,500
okay oh my one of my biggest pet peeves

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,180
is when Chris is wrong like he knows

113
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,979
he's wrong he's a hundred percent wrong

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,900
he's been proven by fact he's been

115
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,460
proven by me and Matt he's been proven

116
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,320
by Google and then he goes and he will

117
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,380
still speak and create like an interview

118
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,580
no here we go he'll go

119
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,400
backing himself okay but like whatever

120
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,199
yeah and like nobody backs himself up

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,560
for like two minutes straight like this

122
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,080
is 100 the truth and he knows he's wrong

123
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,419
deep down he just wants to keep egging

124
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,419
on his false thing forever

125
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,780
okay like forever got me there okay next

126
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,520

127
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,960

135
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,699

141
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,020
room two hours later and I go hey Nick

remember them when I have to go log in

457
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,240
again

458
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,980
when I figure out the [ __ ] Netflix

459
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,260
password because he's trying to log in

460
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,020

462
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,880

the password I figure it out I tell

469
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,200
everyone we're all a part of this

470
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,600
conversation and I have the [ __ ]

471
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,340
bright idea oh someone might want to log

472
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
into this Netflix so I save it in my

473
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,880
notes do you wanna know what Matt does

474
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,039
forget until he needs it again so it's

475
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,780
sitting in my notes that I know when I

476
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,340
want to login gentle reminder I'll be

477
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,580
able to he doesn't write [ __ ] down for

478
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,580
himself

479
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,160
oh God

480
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,020
my password's created and he doesn't

481
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,580
remember I hate when I can't even get

482
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,280
through a doorway or a stairwell because

483
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,200
Nick won't get the [ __ ] out of my way he

484
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,600
happens to always be standing in my way

485
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,160
more like doesn't realize he's in the

486
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,320
way like he'll be in the doorway and

487
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,120
I'll obviously be trying to pass him for

488
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,179
like five seconds which in a doorway

489
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,960
interaction shouldn't be a problem and I

490
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,160
end up standing at that doorway

491
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,360
I remember vividly the other day I had

492
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,860
something in my hands and something in

493
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,059
my mouth because I was carrying a ton of

494
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,620
[ __ ] and I'm like biting on something

495
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,419
like this and I'm like trying to get in

496
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,620
the doorway and I can't even speak to be

497
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,480
