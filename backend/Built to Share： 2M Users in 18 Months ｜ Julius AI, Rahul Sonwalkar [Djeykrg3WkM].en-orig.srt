1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
I quit my job and then it took a year

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,160
and a half for me to launch Julius after

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,240
that. When I when I went all in, I was

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,639
nervous to be honest. I was scared, but

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,480
it's being a little scared is good. I

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,639
think fear is good. You It keeps you

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,199
sharp. It keeps you on your toes. You're

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,920
able to see through things. When you're

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,240
in a comfortable place, it it breeds

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
complacency and you're often, you know,

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,279
fooling yourself into believing that

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,519
your ideas are going to work one day.

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
But then when all the bridges are burned

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,320
and you really have to make a thing

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,200
work, you start thinking, you start

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,000
taking risks, taking shots at goal. But

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,960
having no other boats, you know, no life

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,360
boats, it it was a little scary, but I

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,360
think it was good.

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm Rahul, founder and CEO of Julius AI.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Julius is an AI data analyst. If you

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
have data on your hands, Julius will

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,800
help you get insights from your data

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
within seconds and help you make charts

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,680
and data visualizations. Since launching

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,199
in 2023, our users have used Julius to

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
make over 10 million data

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,280
visualizations. Every day, Julius writes

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,200
over 4 million lines of analysis code. 4

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,840
million lines of code is more than an

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,520
army of data scientists can write every

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,240
day. It took about a year and a half to

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,240
get to 2 million users.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,759
For AI startups, I'll say focus. Don't

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,000
build a general purpose tool. Startups

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,520
win because of focus. That's the only

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,159
advantage you have as a startup. Now,

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,720
Chad GBD is like all-in-one tool. Making

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
videos, making images, doing internet

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,119
search, writing essays, and it's just

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
allin-one tool. And it's not focused on

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
data analysis. So, the experience is

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,720
much worse. A lot of our users they

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,560
start with using Chad GPT and they

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,640
realize that to analyze any kind of real

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,119
data to get any kind of meaningful

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
insights Chad GPD falls short. The

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,200
quality of insights you get aren't that

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
deep. It cannot handle any kind of real

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
data. The charts don't look good. You

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,440
can't collaborate with your colleagues

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,440
on the analysis. So all these problems

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,239
people run into after using it for a day

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,920
for analysis and they all go to Google

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,280
and they look up AI data analysis and

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,080
the number one search result on Google

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
for that is Julius.

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
It's kind of like think about hiring

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,640
humans. Would you want to hire one human

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
that can do everything? You you can and

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,040
that will help you get decent results.

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,519
But then there's comes a point where you

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,599
want someone with deep expertise,

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,560
someone who's really really good at one

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,800
function like a marketer, finance prof,

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,239
finance person, an engineer. I think

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,760
focus agents for a task have much more

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,400
competitive advantage than like the

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,400
general purpose agent.

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,599
You know, there's this like conventional

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,040
meme like Google just killed your

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,120
startup, OpenAI just killed your

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
startup, XYZ just killed this all

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,440
startup. I think all that is very

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,800
overblown. As long as your users don't

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
care about that stuff, it shouldn't

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
matter. If you're building something

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
that solves a problem for people, if

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
you're doing that good job at that

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,319
better than everyone else, that all

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
that's all that matters. So, this is

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,360
back in college when I got into the

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
hackathon scene. I would go to these

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,400
hackathons. The big problem I noticed is

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,720
you have 48 hours to build and launch

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,680
idea. A lot of the time people would

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,159
spend on setting up a backend service,

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
setting up their database and I thought

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,159
that was a waste of time. So water

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
review was this, you know, managed

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,239
service. You would get out of box like a

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
backend server or database that just

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
kind of worked. It got a lot of users

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
and I would go to these hackathons, give

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
it to people and they would try it. It

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,400
would save them time. But problem was

97
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,000
none of the people that built their

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
hackathon projects, their weekend

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,840
projects on waterview continued to work

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,360
on those projects after that weekend.

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,959
You know, it was like a weekend thing.

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,560
The big lesson there was you can solve

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
the right problem. You can solve a

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
painoint for people, but if they don't

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
have that pain point daily or weekly,

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,239
they're not going to retain. They're not

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,680
going to come back to the product. You

108
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
you have to solve a problem people have.

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,799
If they have it only once a year or once

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,239
every 6 months or once a month, they're

111
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
not going to retain to your product.

112
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,280
That's the reason why water we failed.

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,280
And that was a very valuable lesson.

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,360
I worked as an engineer at Uber and

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,759
Facebook. When you're at a big company

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
and you have an idea, one no can kill

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
that idea. Get a yes from your manager.

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
You have to get a yes from your

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,800
manager's manager, design manager,

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,919
product manager. You have to get all

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,080
these yeses and even one no can kill

122
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,320
your idea. So innovation doesn't really

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,400
happen in big companies. And then at a

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,639
startup it's complete opposite. All you

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
need is one yes. Looking for customers

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,880
you know you can get 50 nos but one yes

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
your first customer that's all that

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,560
matters. Instead of one no killing your

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
idea. One yes can really make your

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
company work. So, one of the problems I

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,199
was trying to solve at Uber is people

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,000
book Uber rides usually for things that

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,800
they can't drive to, like uh like an

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,360
airport or from an airport or when

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,720
they're out going out at night to bars

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,080
or restaurants. That sporadic usage is

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
not good for Uber. One of the things I

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,960
wanted to solve for is how could we get

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,479
people to use Uber on a daily and weekly

140
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
basis? So, I wanted to launch this

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,960
commuter product at Uber. How can we

142
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,120
help people use you know Uber's

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,520
offerings Uber transit Uber X Uber um

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,280
Uber mobility like bikes as scooters all

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,639
that as a part of a commuter package

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
that companies could offer their

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,440
employees. So I wanted to pitch the

148
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,800
idea. I was pushing it really really

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,560
hard and you know I got buy in from a

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
lot of cross functional management. I

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
couldn't get behind from our um

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,000
engineering leader and I couldn't get in

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,919
from the engineering leader and that

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
crush idea but at the same time I was

155
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,400
building apps and different ideas on the

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,120
side on the weekends and that motivated

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:08,199
me to just like quit my job and spend a

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,199
year exploring my ideas full-time.

159
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,479
Every failure is is is good. Failing is

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,120
good because you know what's what's not

161
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,280
working. I I I talk to founders and they

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,199
they're too scared to launch, too scared

163
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
to tell people what their idea is.

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
They're too scared to put the product

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,400
out there. I'm the opposite. You know,

166
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
at Julius, we launch things when they're

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
barely working because you want to get

168
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
early feedback from our users, our

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
customers. We want them to try it out.

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,440
We want to learn from our users and

171
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,960
customers on what they actually want and

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
how the things should work. So, I'll

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,240
give you one of the examples. We were

174
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,120
building in you know data and AI and

175
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
insights and we thought you know one of

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,520
the one of the group of people that want

177
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
insights from data but don't have the

178
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,919
expertise to go do data science on their

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,160
own is is sports fans. We built this

180
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,560
thing called NBA GPD was called hoops

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,120
GPD could help you query NBA data

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,919
playby-play data but just asking simple

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,800
questions. We had to build the UI, the

184
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,280
interface, figure out how this text to

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
querying engine is going to work and

186
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,759
ship the whole thing in like two weeks

187
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,960
because if you were too late, the NBA

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,599
season would be over. It was no point to

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,400
wait a year to try the idea again. And

190
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,319
turns out like sports fans aren't that

191
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,319
savvy about data. Turns out it's only

192
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
the people that want to do betting. Yep.

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,960
Really aren't the users you want to

194
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,319
serve. So we learn very quickly know

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
whether it's something people want or

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
don't want. We don't want to build

197
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,599
something that no one will ever want to

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
use. I think failing is important.

199
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,960
Failing fast is really really important.

200
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
Paul Graham talks about this in his

201
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,199
essays all the time. It's like failing

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,199
fast is super important.

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,000
This is months after launching Julius.

204
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,160
We had about 10 15,000 users and most of

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,560
our users at that point were actually

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,360
coming from Chad GPT. Chad GP is this

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,000
plug-in store where users would discover

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Julius and they would come to Julius,

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,879
stay with Julius and use Julius over and

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,360
over and it's going great and it's going

211
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,879
great. We're growing overnight. Open

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,400
announces that the plug-in store is

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,520
going to get shut down and our biggest

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,039
source of users disappeared overnight.

215
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,960
So we had to scramble and figure out how

216
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,039
we're going to get more users and where

217
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,080
we're going to get users from. So that

218
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,719
was an existential moment and that is

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,640
what really got us to move fast and

220
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,760
figure out okay how do we get our users

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,880
to become champions of Julius. Then we

222
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,560
realized that when people analyze data

223
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
they want to tell their colleagues about

224
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,360
it. When you get an insight you don't

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
keep it to yourself. You want to tell

226
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
your colleagues you want to tell your

227
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,040
team. And so we build sharing into the

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,880
product. If you solve a problem that

229
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
people have, they will come to you.

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,560
They'll come to you and they will use

231
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,600
your product and they'll tell their

232
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,279
friends about it. So word of mouth is a

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,360
free way to grow your product.

234
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,000
If I were to start from scratch today,

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,000
what would I do differently?

236
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,560
Nothing. I think you know all the things

237
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,399
I would consider as like missteps things

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,519
um I could have avoided I think those

239
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,920
are valuable lessons you know all the

240
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
features we tried and didn't work out

241
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,000
all that is really valuable lesson

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,800
that's helpful data you can if you have

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
only data from successes then that's

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,720
very skewed you know what doesn't work

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,040
so it's really important to try a lot of

246
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,320
things things that don't work also

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
important because now you know what

248
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,080
doesn't work honestly like I would not

249
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,080
do anything differently.
