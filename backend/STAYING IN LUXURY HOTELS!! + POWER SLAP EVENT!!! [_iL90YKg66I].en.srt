77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,720

156
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,759
good time I can't believe I'm walking

157
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,319
the Las Vegas Strip I was walking in

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,039
this Las Vegas trip when I was 14 years

159
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,080
old right here's the the picture to

160
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,039

that age than it is right now and I

163
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,319
can't believe how far we've come in

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,319
YouTube and how far Justin has come

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
playing poker out here it's crazy to

166
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,240

167
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,440

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,039
impossible

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,000
because we're not 21 we're not on it was

219
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,440

226
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,839
it's so weird like being in Vegas with

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
Justin cuz we used to visit Justin when

228
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,680
we were like like freshman and

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,440
sophomores in high school and we would

230
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,279

287
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,600
again I

288
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,760

289
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,079

290
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,959

291
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,519
these ones are like like look there's 1

292
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,839
2 3 4 5 6 7 eight holes in that one and

293
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,360
there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 holes

294
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,519
in this one kid you're making [ __ ] up

295
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,560
again no I'm not look at the difference

296
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,040
oh yeah well maybe we I have your other

297
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,360
half maybe I don't know if that's like a

298
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,519
if that's a plating if that's like a PL

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,680
but here's here's the other question

300
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,959
that I had yeah do you feel like that

301
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,800
experience oh is look at this I love

302
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,079
little spoons just to get some butter is

303
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,880
equal to or less

304
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,760
than your usual experience like do you

305
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,600
think that will outweigh I did feel a

306
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,800
little like iffy about it m but I think

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,040
if it was like a regular

308
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,360
motion for me I could get up and walk

309
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,240
about my day just

310
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,639
fine okay yeah definitely something that

311
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,320
would need so like it it could it could

312
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,440
become the daily occurrence 100% yeah

313
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,680
but the thing is I really think that the

314
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,120
world needs to invest in higher class

315
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,320
and fancier toilets in public restrooms

316
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,440
and just more public restrooms MH

317
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,720
everywhere cuz I feel like some of the

318
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,320
most uncomforting feeling is like having

319
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
to use a bathroom like somewhere super

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,160
public mhm the ladies get it all figured

321
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,880
out oh yeah with all the Stalls get rid

322
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,079
of urals guys can pee in toilets why do

323
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,360
we

324
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:43,240
got seven rows just piss yeah you're

325
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,639
right make that four extra stalls you

326
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,800
got to walk into a stall to pee your

327
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,120
[ __ ] figure it out this is unbelievable

328
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,440
you got have to Waffle really yeah cuz I

329
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,320
feel like part of it's like a walk of

330
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,360
shame walking to the walk to the stall

331
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,240
in public especially when you can see in

332
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
the stall like through the crack yeah I

333
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,720
hate it tonight we're going to go to

334
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,199
Power slap

335
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,920
yep the the reason why we're here

336
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,399
actually is the power slap event they

337
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,320
got they put us on to everything that's

338
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,560
why we're in the room we in everything

339
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,240
is because of them so shout out power

340
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,160
slot it was just very convenient timing

341
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,399
that Justin also was placed at a final

342
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,320
table in his poker game the day and like

343
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,560
the LA flight to Vegas is nothing it's

344
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,560
literally like 30 minutes yeah so if

345
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,120
Justin was playing at a final table in

346
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,120
Vegas I would fly out here to support

347
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,120
him anyway for sure it just happens to

348
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,959
be it was like outstand standing timing

349
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,760
yeah it was awesome all right guys we're

350
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,120

to people getting smacked across the

358
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,839
[ __ ] SL is the whole reason we're

359
