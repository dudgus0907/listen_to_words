[Music]

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
When you get dressed, you should think a

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,920
little longer. Next, the gay son and

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
you're the daughter. When you get

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,680
dressed, you should think a little

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
longer. Put down all the soda. You

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,680
should go and drink a water. I'm the

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
favorite child. You can go and ask your

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
father. Me and Nico give you bars.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
That's a guarantee. Competition for the

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,520
worst. Brother, you're the nominee. Now

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
you hit him up, but I don't even

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,640
disagree. Yeah, I had to tell him cuz he

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
want to be like me. Yeah, he want to be

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,200
just like me. Yeah, he want to be just

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,120
like me. Yeah, he want to be just like

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,280
me. Yeah, he want to be like me. Looking

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,920
at me thinking that's something I should

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
do. I'm the gay triplet, but I get more

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
girls than you. Me and Matt hold this

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,239
 together. We the triplet glue.

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
Haven't thought of a good video since

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,199
the zoo. I'm the favorite child. You can

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,960
go and ask Mary Lou. Pepsi said no. You

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,560
should probably climb Mountain Dew.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,320
After all these bars, I can't believe

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
you still don't have a clue. Can't get

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,600
back to the hook. Somebody's got to tell

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:23,520
you. Yeah. You want to be? Yeah. You

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:26,400
want to be Yeah. You want to be Yeah.

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,640
You want to be an army? Make a case on

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
it. You're the hot daughter. When you

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,720
get dressed, you should think a little

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
longer. Look at all the soda. You should

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,640
go and drink a water. I'm the favorite

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,680
child. You can go and ask your father.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,880
Yeah. You want to be just like me? Yeah.

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,079
You want to be just like me? Yeah. You

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,479
want to be just like me? Yeah. You want

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,479
to be just

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,479
like me?
