path we decide to follow it sometimes

415
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,680
usually when you say swiper might swipe

416
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,759

gorilla in the cage what's the cage

444
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,040
let's talk about like the survival rate

445
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
if either of those things happen you

446
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,959
think you're more likely to survive in a

447
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,440
cage for 8 hours with sharks swimming

448
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,160
circling around you sleep you can't even

449
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600

505
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,440
likeliness of being built one with the

506
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,600
gorilla than the shark and that's family

there's like documentaries where these

515
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
people go into the jungle and just

516
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,960
