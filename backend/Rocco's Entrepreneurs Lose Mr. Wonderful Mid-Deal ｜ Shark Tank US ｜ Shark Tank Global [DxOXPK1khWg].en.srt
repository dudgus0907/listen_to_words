00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,759
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,270
Next into the tank is a stylish upgrade

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,160
to an everyday appliance.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,160
[Music]

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,600
Hi Sharks. I'm Elise. And I'm Sam. And

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
we're seeking $600,000 for 3% of our

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,400
company, Rocco. Actually, Sam, before we

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,920
get started, I'm a little thirsty. Why

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,359
don't you just go grab a drink from my

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,920
kitchen fridge over there? One second,

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,440
Sharks. I'm so sorry. There should be a

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,920
soda in there. You might just have to

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,840
dig dig a little bit. Oh. Oh,

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
I hate it when that happens. I can't

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
find anything in here. There's

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
leftovers. There's produce. Where's the

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,039
drinks? I think it should be behind the

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,440
lasagna or or the pizza box, maybe.

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,760
That's embarrassing.

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,520
Sharks, as you can see, kitchen fridges

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
are crowded. They're cluttered. They're

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
just plain chaotic. That's why we

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
created the Roco Super Smart Drinks

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
fridge. It's designed as furniture so

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,640
you can keep all of your favorite drinks

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,880
away from those leftovers. And where you

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
actually drink them, in the living room.

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,200
You might be thinking, "This is just

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
another wine fridge." Sorry, Mr.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
Wonderful, but nobody just drinks wine

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,280
anymore. We created a one-of-a-kind

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,080
shelving system that accommodates all

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,439
sizes of bottles and cans. Everything

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,320
from ginger shots to champagne. The top

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,960
doubles as a pour serve store station,

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
aka it's also a bar cart. And with our

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
patent pending site system, you can even

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
see inside your fridge right from your

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
phone. Imagine you're at the grocery

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,759
store. You're having friends over later

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,680
and you can't remember if you have

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,280
enough beer. Now, all you have to do is

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
look at the app and you'll know exactly

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
how much you need. So, Sharks, who's

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
ready to do a deal and pop some

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
champagne?

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
All right. I know what's coming. All

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,200
right. You know what's coming. You know

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,200
what's coming.

50
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,780
[Applause]

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,079
And in front of you are the um trays

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
that come with the fridge to kind of

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,960
turn it into a bar cart. How much is the

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,119
fridge? The fridge is $14.95 and we

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,959
currently offer early access pricing of

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,640
$12.95. Is that a lot for a basic? As a

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,400
matter of fact, I just bought two not of

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
yours. I didn't know about yours, but of

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
a different one. And I will tell you,

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,920
yours is the right price and what the

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,160
guy was trying to sell me was three

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,560
times as much. How does the app work? Do

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,080
I actually see into the fridge? So,

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
every time you put something in or take

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
it out, it automatically images it. No

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,040
scanning whatsoever. And your app will

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,879
update. So, so I see shelf. Shelf by

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
shelf. That's an innovation I haven't

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,440
seen. Now, tell us about the two of you.

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
Yes. So, Sam and I have a combined 20

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,040
years of experience in startups. I cold

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
emailed Casper, the mattress company,

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,920
and I helped build the brand from the

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
ground up. Then I went to Billy, the

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
women's razor brand, which sold a few

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
years ago to one of the biggest CPG

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
companies. Sam spent many years at Away

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,480
leading supply chain and product

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,920
development. And while he was at Away,

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,599
the suitcase brand, his work actually

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
took him to fridge factories because,

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
believe it or not, there are

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,319
manufacturing similarities between

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
fridges and suitcases. You sell it for

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,480
$12.95 or $14.95. What does it cost you

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,840
to make? So, our landed costs are

87
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,640
$575 and then after shipping, which is

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,239
another $130 to $160 depending on where

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,720
you are in the country, it gets to

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,480
around 750 to 775. So, you don't have

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,040
much margin. No. How do you how do you

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,519
sell it today? Director, how many have

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,000
you sold? Just over 3,000. Sam, have you

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,760
guys raised a lot of money? We raised a

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
million dollars about a about 2 years

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,400
ago. At what valuation? That was at $10

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
million on a post money save. Why are

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
you telling us you're worth 20 now? So

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
that was 2 years ago before we even had

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,040
a prototype. We've been in market for 8

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
months. We've done $4 million of

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,120
revenue. We're profitable in 8 months.

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,640
In 8 months that

104
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,480
ready that's shipped and we've ordered

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
enough units to be able to do a $12

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
million year this year, which is what

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
we're forecast. And on that $4 million,

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,040
how much have you spent to create the

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,000
buzz? So we have a return on ad spend of

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,239
five times. So, we spend about

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,920
$250 per fridge or 20% of our revenue.

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
Look, I like it. I like the story. I

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,879
like the pitch. I like the whole direct.

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,239
You guys are great. I I I just don't

115
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,000
like the valuation. So, here's what I'll

116
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,000
do. I'll give you the 600,000 for 10%.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Well, they're going to jump at that. I

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,720
think they should. I think they I think

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,040
they should. Wow, that was a very loud

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
laugh. That's why I laugh all the time.

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
Look, I don't think you're worth more

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,199
than six million bucks. I'm sorry, guys.

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,199
I think it's a beautiful product. I'm

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,759
not sure I see the vision. I just don't

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,919
see it. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you.

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,120
Appreciate guys. Here here's where I'm

127
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,600
at. Look, great product, great company.

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,400
Problem is a math problem. When you

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,440
price it at a $20 million valuation in

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,759
order for me to get my $600,000 back,

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,400
you have to do $20 million in net cash

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,680
flow profits. $20 million cash flow

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,600
profits. 3% of that is my $600,000 back.

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,440
If I want to get a multiple return since

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
it's a risky environment, let's just say

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,800
three or four times, you need to do 60

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,720
$80 million in free cash flow to give me

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,639
a return. That's the challenge of making

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,960
this investment. So, for those reasons,

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm out. Yeah. And I'm kind of in a

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,840
similar place. It's very hard to imagine

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that things could pan out in a way that

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,680
would be good for you and for us. I also

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,320
was thinking about how I could add value

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
to you and I probably could find a few

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
ways, but I don't know that I would be

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
the best shark for you for this deal.

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,600
So, for those reasons, I'm out. Thank

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,960
you, Lori. You know, listen, I love you

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,560
both. The real problem for me is your

151
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,919
valuation. I mean, it's rough. Mark said

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
it all. I'm not even going to try to

153
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,600
repeat it cuz he really said it all

154
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,560
quite squarely. What would you consider

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
to be reasonable? Yeah, we're open. Oh,

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,199
you guys would not want to even know.

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Kevin was at 10. I I'm going to be

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,039
honest. Like to me, you're so startup. I

159
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,880
would have been at 20, which you're

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,320
never going to consider. It just doesn't

161
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,960
feel like the right deal. So, I'm sorry.

162
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm out.

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,600
All roads lead to Mr. Wonder.

164
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,759
Well, I I I really think you heard it

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,759
from everybody in the same succinct way.

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
Valuation is a huge problem. Mhm. I

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
actually think your offer is generous. I

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,840
do. I gave him a 6 million valuation

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
with no path to liquidity. So, there's a

170
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,199
lot of risk in it. I just happen to

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,360
think my social would blow this up so

172
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,000
huge if you were able to figure out a

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,000
way to fulfill and I also think I can

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,520
reduce your CAC. Do you mind if we talk

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,759
about your offer for a second and speak

176
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,360
amongst yourselves? Thank you.

177
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,400
Sorry. Do you want to bring I want to

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,400
bring someone else back in.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,639
Sorry.

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah. Lot of whispering going on. No,

181
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,319
I've actually been thinking about your

182
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,840
free cash flow comment, but this is a

183
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
category where the free cash flows of

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,880
say Whirlpool, it's a billion dollars.

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
Her who bought out GE, it's $2 billion.

186
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
How many products do they have? They

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
have five. How long did it take him to

188
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,360
get there? 100 years. What's happening

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,840
here? Kevin has an offer on the table,

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,280
which doesn't always stay there.

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,479
Actually, I have to be honest with you

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,880
guys. I'm out.

193
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,720
All five sharks are out. Sam and Elise

194
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,800
had an offer on the table from Kevin for

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
their designer beverage fridge, Rocco,

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,680
but their hesitation led to a change of

197
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,840
heart. The only offer you had was me.

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,880
And then you're talking to Cuban again.

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,199
You know, Mr. Wonderful doesn't feel

200
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,199
good about that. You hurt his feelings.

201
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
I now will forget who you are tomorrow

202
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,720
morning because there's going to be five

203
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,680
more deals coming through that door. I'm

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,759
out. See you guys later. Ciao. We wanted

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,440
to offer a royalty. I'm not sure if

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,199
there's a way to get you back in. What's

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,360
your offer? What is it?

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
We want to We can be a little flexible

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,919
on the valuation. So, let's let's do a

210
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,240
royalty particularly tied to your

211
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,560
channels. No, I'm not doing that. The

212
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,479
minute my name is on this, it's every

213
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
unit gets a royalty because all of a

214
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,360
sudden it's a Mr. Wonderful deal. If you

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,800
don't believe that, talk to my 54 CEOs.

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
See what they say. What's the royalty

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
you would give? Yeah, but only on what

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,000
Kevin generates. I'm not doing that. I'm

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
not either. Yeah. I'm not making up a

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
commission saleserson. I'm an investor

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
with a huge curious what's the royalty

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,319
you would give. What would you give? You

223
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,720
do the marketing numbers.

224
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm not doing that deal. I I'm not for

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,759
I'm the one asking.

226
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,639
Where's the fridge? It was 50. $50 a

227
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,919
fridge. Until you get your money back. I

228
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,640
just want to throw something back at

229
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,440
you. Okay. No qualifiers, but

230
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,440
$600,000. $50 a fridge. That's it. If we

231
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,959
can keep the regular equity ask, we'll

232
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,760
do $50 every fridge back. $50 every

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:53,200
fridge. Would you do it till five at 5%?

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,440
4%. 5%. 4% 5%. Can we talk about that

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,440
for one sec? I do it at 3% in

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
perpetuity,

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
which is forever.

238
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,760
Take the deal. I mean, you're going to

239
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,760
We plan to be around for a long time.

240
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,279
So, a long time. As long as we're all

241
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,839
full.

242
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,680
4% and until you get your money back.

243
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,760
We'll meet you in the middle. How about

244
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,959
4% until I get my money back plus

245
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,360
another 300,000? Done. Done. There you

246
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,320
go. Wonderful.

247
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
Boom. Oo. Who knew? Now I bought that

248
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,880
other fridge. Oh my. Well, we're going

249
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,959
to have to replace them. I

250
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,959
mean, good deal. Good idea. Thank you.

251
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,920
Congratulations, guys. Thank you. Thank

252
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,920
you, everyone.
