You can wear this one tonight. First

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,480
into the tank tonight, a savvy young

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,279
businesswoman who's not letting age

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
stand in her way. My name is Briella.

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm just like any other 20-year-old

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,920
girl. I love hanging out with my

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,400
friends, going to the beach, and most of

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,480
all, I love shopping. What do you think?

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
I like them. I have always wanted to run

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,200
my own business, even from a very early

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,120
age. I came up with this business idea

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
from personal experience. So, it's

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
helped me, my friends, and hopefully

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
lots of other women in Australia. This

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,800
20-year-old is ready to take on the

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
world.

Hello, my name is Bela and I am the

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,799
founder and director of Your Closet. I

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,119
am here today seeking an $80,000

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,520
investment for a 20% stake in my

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,520
business. Please let me introduce my

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,200
gorgeous models who will be modeling

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,840
some of my gorgeous dresses.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,799
Your Closet is an online service that

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,799
allows women to rent high-end designer

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
fashion from Australia's leading

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,920
designers, including Camila Mark,

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,360
Nicholas, and Josh Goo for a fraction of

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,640
the purchase

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,600
price. Let me take you back to the

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,560
beginning. 2 years ago, I was invited to

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,439
four formals in 4 weeks. First world

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,680
problems, I know. And I'm sure you are

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,159
all very aware formal dresses are

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,680
extremely expensive. And the craziest

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,799
thing is we often only wear them once.

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,240
It was driving my mom crazy and my dad

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,239
broke and he didn't even know the full

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,160
story. I launched the business in August

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,920
2014. And since launching, I quickly

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,599
realized, hey, this business has some

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,760
legs. And it's not just applicable to

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,160
young girls renting for formal. It's

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,640
applicable to all women who want to look

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,800
fabulous when it matters most. This

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,239
includes going to the races, New Year's

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,080
Eve, red carpet galas, cocktail events,

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,400
birthdays, work functions, and

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,560
everything in

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,400
between. My vision for your closet is to

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,959
revolutionize the way women look at

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,440
special occasion wear and to normalize

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,760
the option of renting. I've got the

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,840
business to where it is today by myself,

60
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,200
but I need one of you to help me

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,920
supercharge your closet. Sharks, are you

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,400
ready to dress for success? Ah, well

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,720
done. Great job. Great presentation. A

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,239
Bella, was it? Yes. Great. So, a woman

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,720
can rent a dress for a fraction of a

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,200
cost, a fraction of $1,000. Tell us

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,519
about that. We rent our dresses out

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,159
based on a percentage of the retail

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
price. So, it's roughly about 18 to 20%

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,239
of the retail price of the dress. So if

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,760
a dress is $1,000, you rent it out for

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,000
about 180 to 200. So just quickly how it

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,640
works is you jump onto the your closet

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
website. You view our big range of

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
dresses and from the latest designers.

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,480
You pick one that you love. You then

77
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
choose a delivery date. The dress

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,040
arrives to you in a pristine box looking

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
amazing. You then wear it to your event

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,519
and then on the fourth day you simply

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
slip it into a prepaid pre-addressed

82
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
satchel and drop it off to Australia

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Post. Sounds pretty good. We take care

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
of the dry cleaning. That's fantastic,

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,159
Bella.

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,920
Very clever, creative idea. Thank you.

87
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,680
How long do I have to wait? I've I've

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
suddenly been invited to an event. It

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
was very short notice and I need the

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,000
dress quickly. What's my minimum wait

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
time? If you're in Sydney, 3 hours, get

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
it straight away. And then other capital

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,680
cities, one day, so we can send express

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
to ride the next morning for you. What's

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,560
your size range? At the moment, it's 6

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,480
to 12. Now, the average women is is a

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
bit bigger than that. the sort of 12 to

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
14. Are you cutting a lot of your market

99
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,280
at the moment? Yeah. And I'm looking to

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,280
expand this over the next 12 months.

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Good. Sorry, I'm Steve. Where are you

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,040
from, Briella? I'm from Manley in the

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,919
Northern Beaches. Oh, nice. Sydney.

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
Okay, great. Hey. Um, uh, so I imagine

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
some of these functions you go to like

106
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
races and formals for example, there may

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,880
be some especially the races, there may

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
be some damage to the to the dresses.

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,880
How's that handled? How does bonds or

110
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,440
insuranceances work? What happens there?

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,320
Roughly one in 200 dresses, so half a

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,720
percent of dresses come back damaged.

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,440
Women appreciate that these are gorgeous

114
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
gowns and they treat they treat them

115
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,360
well. So what happens to the one and 200

116
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,360
that are damaged?

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
In that case, the customer is asked to

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,520
pay a small fee and then takes on full

119
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
ownership of that dress. So that asked

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,840
to pay the other 90 80 sorry 80 odd

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
percent. Is that right? Yes. And then we

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,479
just send them that dress to enjoy. Oh

123
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,400
hand. So, you said a small fee. So, if

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,840
it's if you're only paying 20% of the

125
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,540
dress and it's $1,000 dress, small fee

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,800
is $800.

127
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:23,479
[Music]

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,479
I guess that's one way of looking at it.

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,560
You damage it, you own it. Is that it?

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Basically, yeah, that's essentially in.

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,880
Do you own the dresses? Yes. How did you

132
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
get the stock? I actually took out a

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,800
personal loan to fund the business. How

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,360
much of $82,000? $82,000. How old are

135
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,880
you? I'm 20. You're doing a great job.

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,919
Well done. Thank you. What's What's your

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
value in dresses you have in the

138
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,560
business, please? Around $200,000. Where

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,320
are you warehousing these? Uh, this has

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
run out of my house at the moment. You

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
must have an extraordinary large

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,680
wardrobe. I've converted nearly every

143
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
room in my house to somehow store some.

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,880
Your parents must be very accommodating.

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,199
Oh, they're incredibly supportive. So,

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,560
let's talk about the revenue so far. So

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,080
just say the last three or four months,

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,720
month by month, what's your revenue

149
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,100
been? 35, 35, and 36,000.

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,289
Yes.

151
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,289
[Music]

152
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,800
And what's your costs against that? A

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,160
cost, our profit, it runs at around 55%

154
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,919
of revenue. Did you take a wage? Not at

155
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,520
the moment. No wage. Okay. So the

156
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,240
revenue that is coming in is reinvested

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,240
back into the business.

158
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
I have two daughters going to formals.

159
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
Tell you I have felt your dad's pain

160
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,479
this year. For me, um I I don't think I

161
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
add a lot of value as a partner to you

162
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,240
and that's what you need. Someone who

163
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
understands the fashion industry um and

164
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,479
will partner with you to help scale this

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,520
up quickly and own this space in in the

166
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,639
Australian market. And uh I I think what

167
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,160
you've done to date is sensational. Uh

168
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,160
but I'm out. Thank you for your

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
feedback.

170
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,199
Reala. Wow. 20 years old. I'm

171
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,880
embarrassed. I can't recall I was doing

172
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,440
it 20. It wasn't this. Um, that's 35,000

173
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,599
bucks a month is incredible. Um, I've

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,039
had a lot of similar dress marketplaces,

175
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,720
shoe marketplaces, god knows what

176
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
fashion market places presented to me,

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
and that they they have a lot of trouble

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
answering the questions that you've

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,960
actually proved probably aren't issues,

180
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,960
at least in your model anyway.

Um

182
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,039
um I'm just going to take a break on

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,039
that and have a think

184
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,960
actually. See what else is going to

185
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,840
happen. Ladies, you're the experts in

186
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,080
this

area. Look, normally if it's something

189
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,440
like $80,000, it's hardly worth

190
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,599
splitting it with um someone, you know,

191
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,080
40 40 is not worth it. In this case,

192
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,280
however, um I'm strong in digital

193
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,520
marketing, but I'm not strong in

194
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,120
logistics. I will actually go if if

195
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
Steve will have me, I will actually do a

196
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,280
deal with Steve with you on it if he'll

197
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:15,479
if he'll take it. Uh the deal will be

198
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,479
$80,000 for 30% split.

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Are you going into that ste?

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,320
made an offer, but it's on the condition

207
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
that Steve joins her. Are you going into

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680

if I want to get into the fashion game.

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,910
All right. Well, hold that thought.

If I was to make an offer, it would be

214
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,440
dependent on really um making sure that

215
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,080
we do have sign off on the logistics

216
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640

homebased business and your family and

218
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,839
you will implode if that doesn't get

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,810
sorted really quickly. You've asked for

220
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,880
$80,000. I'd be looking

221

[Music]

222
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,839

Wow.

224
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,839
Okay. So, $80,000 for

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,959
40%. Janine, a provisional $80,000 for

226
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,000
30%, assuming Steve may go with her. Are

227
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,160
you an 80 or Look, I think you are

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
amazing and you're incredible. You what

229
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,399
you've done. You've got a great front

230
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
end. The the the idea is great. The

231
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,880
website's great, but you're a bit like

232
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,720
Amazon, a tiny Amazon. you've got a huge

233
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
logistics back end and that's going to

234
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,839
need a lot of management time and it

235
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,320
will also really damage your margins as

236
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,920
you grow. For those reasons, I'm out.

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,920
But I really wish you well. Thank you.

238
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,640
Bit like Andy, I think that you're the

239
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
you're the gem in this business. One of

240
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
the big issues I've got is fashion

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
doesn't do it for me. If I were you, I

242
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,279
would try to get those two to go

243
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,399
together on

244
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,600
35%. That's the deal you want out of

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,800
this entire tank. Uh I'm out. If you

246
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,040
want, I can help you negotiate with

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,560

So, Janine, would you go in with me, but

250
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,800
I I want 40%. Yeah, I I would. Um, yep,

251
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,519
certainly love to. You want two sharks

252
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,760
at 20% each? Can I please have a minute

253
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,760
to discuss with my dad? Of course. Thank

254
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,760
you.

255
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,360
How are you? Good. Good. So, it all went

256
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,000
all right. Great. Good. Yes. And the

257
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,120
offers I've got so far is Janine and Ni,

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,880
the two women, right, have offered 40%

259
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,040
20% each for $80,000. Right.

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,200
What an amazing young lady. I mean, far

261
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
out. I wonder if my children surely she

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,519
can date one of them. If you felt

263
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,079
confident that they can both add

264
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,079
significant value to that business over

265
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,880
the course of the next of the future.

266
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,279
You go 15% each for 30% for that same

267
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,200
money. I can see the house now, can't

268
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,200
you? Bedrooms full of clothes. Oh yeah.

[Music]

270
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,360
You spoke to your dad. Yes. And what did

271
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:49,920
he say? What do you think? I'm proposing

272
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,560
30% so 1515 for the $80,000.

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,399
I'm confident in the business growth, in

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,079
the idea, in my passion, and I think the

275
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,360
skill sets that I may bring. So that's

276
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,560
your counter offer? Yes, that's my

277
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,399
counter offer. 30% 80,000 for 30%. Yes.

278
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,320
The the reality is also we've got to go

279
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,079
backwards, go forward because right now

280
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
you're you're in your home. So we've got

281
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
to get there's got to be a warehouse.

282
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,560
there got to be more staff. So there's a

283
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,200
there's quite a big execution risk as in

284
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,320
loss making. The other thing is that we

285
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
actually know we're going to have to put

286
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
more money into the business, whatever

287
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,160
that looks like in terms of loans or

288
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,800
what have you, because you're going to

289
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
need dry cleaning on site at the

290
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,120
warehousing so that you don't have that

291
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
as a cost. And that logistics is

292
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
actually critical to your growth. And

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
unless you get that right and you know

294
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,440
what your life is like right now, don't

295
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,279
you? Yes. I know. and that is not

296
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,519
sustainable. So the investment that's

297
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
going to need to be made to set that up,

298
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,519
there's going to be more capital

299
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,959
required. And you've got, you know, two

300
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,079
business women who have been there, done

301
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,120
that, and there's a hell of a lot of

302
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,970
experience that we're bringing to the

303
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,879

[Music]

305
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,399
cash. What I'd like to suggest as well

306
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,079
is, you know, sweat for equity. As you

307
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,480
said, you're not taking a wage, but

308
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,320
let's actually calculate it as we go and

309
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,720
then you can get equity for your sweat

310
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
as we go. So, you understand they're

311
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
saying because you're working in the

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
business, they'll give you the

313
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,079
opportunity to get some equity, some

314
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,839
shares back based on your service as the

315
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,639
CEO driving the business and that's what

316
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,639

320
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,279
rest of my equity 2 years from now if I

321
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,030
go with these people or whether I do my

Morgan was born when I was 13 years old

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
and I started supplying a cafe with

358
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
local goods. From there, things just

359
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,199
kind of blew up. I was featured in

360
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,680
numerous media outlets and a whole

361
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,279
whirlwind of opportunities came at me. I

362
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,639
ended up supplying around 20 cafes

363
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,120
around Melbourne until I was absolutely

364
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
desperate on a permanent store. And my

365
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
parents being, you know, parents, they

366
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,399
were like, "No, you're not allowed a

367
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,000
permanent store till you're out of

368
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,720
school." So, we came to a compromise

369
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,079
that how about we do a pop-up store? And

370
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,519
before they knew, I was on the phone to

371
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,959
real estate agents and had already

372
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,720
sorted out a location for my store. And

373
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,720
the 8 days went so well, we ended up

374
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,199
selling over 10,000 donuts in those 8

375
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,279
days. Goodness. So, from there, store

376
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,120
came up for permanent lease. I

377
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,160
eventually convinced my parents after

378
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,920
many arguments at the dinner

379
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,639
table and the store's been open around

380
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,680
15 months now. We continue to supply

381
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,600
around 10 to 20 cafes and dessert bars

382
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
around Melbourne. So yeah, it's, you

383
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,120
know, keeps me busy as well as being in

384
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,759
year 12 in high school. So I'm in my

385
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,759
final year of school. So I think now is

386
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
a good time to maybe try some of the

387
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,480
dough.

388
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,320
Well done. Thank you. Excellent job.

389
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,320
Amazing. First up the good. Yeah.

390
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,959
So we got our cookie monster which is

391
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,480

392
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,040

393
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,839

then our gay time crunch which is based

400
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,079
off the ice cream the golden gay time

401
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,360
and made into a donut. My favorite. I'll

402
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,360

Well, you're going to knock yourself

408
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
out. Knock yourself out. Right. You sell

409
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,640
it with a syringe, too. Exactly. Right.

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,640
Tastes really good.

411
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,640
And who comes up with recipes?

412
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,240
So, you were asking for 200,000 for 20%

413
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
valuing your business at $1 million.

414
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,320
That's right. That's not a bad ask for a

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,720
17y old. When you do that $10,000 worth

416
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
of sales, how 10,000 donuts? 10,000

417
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,300
donuts. Yeah. And the donuts are 550

418
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,679
each for retail.

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,600
travel for.

449
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,679
Listen, uh, Morgan, I'm already a

450
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,240
shareholder in a pretty substantial

451
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,000
national donut business, and I'm I'm not

452
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,320

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,080
this product. Dangerous, eh? That's a

460
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,400
good answer. What I notice about my

461
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,400

462
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,640

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,880

538
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,880
you consulted the board. I get that. We

539
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,080
did. So, just to remind you, Janine's

540
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,400
offered you 200,000 for 42% of your

541
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:42,760
business. Yeah. And Steve has offered

542
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,760

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,120
So, what are you going to do? So, we've

544
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,320
had a bit of a chat. My dad's pretty

545
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,480
firm, so he thinks that I'm a worthwhile

546
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,559
investment as such.

547
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,120
So would any of you be willing to do

548
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,120
anything for 20?

549
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,760
20% said

550
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,760

554
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,640

555
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240

If you walk away from here, I will still

570
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,679
spend time with you. I don't want you to

571
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,600
feel that it's bad. I actually know that

572
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,679
what I've offered is actually a good

573
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,400
deal, but I don't want you feeling that.

574
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,080
So, you've got me either way, but you

575
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,460
can have me as an equity holder. Yeah.

576

feel comfortable going above the 20%

mark at this point in time.

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,640
I I can't go below. That's okay. But I

582
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,440
will still spend time with you. Yeah. We

583
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,000

who knows, I might be an equity partner.

586
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,159
Yeah. Somewhere down the track. But I

587
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,600
will definitely definitely definitely be

588
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,320

Hi, my name is Kane. I'm the CEO of

621
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:32,159
Icapsulate. 13 years ago, I made a clear

622
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,000
and conscious decision to turn my life

623
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,360
around and build a strong and successful

624
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,279
company.

625
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,440
I'm here today to ask you for $2.5

626
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:43,360
million

627
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,600
for 15% of my company. So that was 2.5.

628
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,080
It is. Wow.

629
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,679
For 15%.

630
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,720
I'll go hard or go home. All right. Get

631
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,039
into it. Okay.

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,200
A capsulate um is a coffee company

633
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,360
specializing in capsules, pods, and

634
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,360
roasted beans. We're the largest in the

635
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,320
Southern Hemisphere.

636
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,799
We produce currently 35 million capsules

637
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,799
and pods

638
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,520
peranom. Uh we have contracts with

639
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,720
Australia and New Zealand's largest

640
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,559
coffee companies. Uh I'm expanding the

641
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,640
formats of I capsulate next year which

642
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,880
will increase that another 20 million

643
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,240
pieces and I'm still to execute two

644
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,840
contracts by the end of this year which

645
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
will also add another 20 million pieces

646
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,440
to the business.

647
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,440
The thing with I capsulate is in June

648
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,600
we'll launch a world first biodegradable

649
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,640
hermetically sealed capsule. The

650
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
difference between this and other

651
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,679
capsules is ours is biodegradable so we

652
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,360
can drop it straight in the garden. The

653
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,360
other thing with our capsules we we

654
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
produce the best. We're 35% higher

655
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,640
coffee solids than any other

656
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,240
manufacturer in Australia. We have the

657
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
lowest oxygen residual, meaning the

658
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,520
freshest coffee capsule as well. So what

659
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,960
I would like to do is let you taste the

660
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,039
difference between a crap and a good cup

661
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,320
of coffee. I capate being a good one.

662
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:02,360
Okay, Kane. And that was

663
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:06,399
$2.5 million for 15% of your value at

664
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,760
$16.6 million. Yes.

665
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,600
How long ago did you start this

666
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,840
business? Uh, one and a half years ago.

667
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,480
Wow. Well, what a great result that is.

668
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,360
Wow.

669
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,720
This is the first lot. What's this one?

670
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,360
This is the one that you don't want to

671
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,760
drink. Just have a smell first, just so

672
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,159
you know. Um, as a as a point of

673
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,600
difference, smells revoling. Okay, so

674
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,520
this is the bad one. This is evil

675
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,799
coffee. Evil coffee. Yeah, it's bitter.

676
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,919
Um, you'll notice the capsules slightly

677
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,120
different. And I'll bring some capsules

678
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,240
around for you to have a look. Thank

679
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,080
you. Thank you. So, first thing you'll

680
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,080
notice is the crema difference and the

681
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,399
color and I should hope the flavor. Oh,

682
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,399
thank you. Oh, yeah. You can see it.

683
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,080
Yeah, it's massive. What was your past

684
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,159
life? Cuz you only been going 18 months.

685
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,679
Yeah. So, always coffee. My mom was a

686
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,080
chef. So instead of working in the

687
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,919
kitchen with her, um I said I I'll stay

688
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,679
out and do the bar and coffee. Through

689
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,559
school and everything, I continued doing

690
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,760
coffee and I set up a coffee roasting

691
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:03,600
company. Did that for a couple of years

692
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,679
and I was offered um the technical

693
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,440
position for Daoberts. So I ran all

694
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,279
their technical division for them and

695
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,120
then Gloria Jeans poached me from there

696
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,120
and I ran Gloria Jeans Worldwide for

697
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,720
their coffee and technical. Wow. So I

698
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,799
launched Cafe Italy for Gloria Jeans

699
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,320
into Woolworth. Um and seeing the

700
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,840
success of that I decided to start my

701
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,039
own company.

702
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,360
What are you most proud of? This is um

703
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,039
my partners and my life. Like we we've

704
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,640
invested everything into it. We've lived

705
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,120
and breathed the factory. We installed

706
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,880
the machinery ourself. There's $16

707
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,039
million worth of machinery currently on

708
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
the

709
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,799
floor. Coffee is our life.

710
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,799
So your business is not just putting

711
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,399
your own coffee in capsules. It's

712
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,320
putting other people's coffee in

713
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,320
capsules as well. So are you like the

714
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,159
tetra pack of capsules? Yes. So our

715
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,600
customers we can say all of Australia's

716
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,360
leading manufacturers or coffee

717
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,039
companies. All the big coffee brands

718
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,600
that we would know. Y So what are your

719
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,600
sales? So $ 37.5 million at the moment

720
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,159
pieces peranom. Talk your revenues

721
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,640
please. So um last year was 4 million.

722
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,440
$4 million. That is very impressive.

723
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,440
That's very nice. Okay. You've been

724
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,039
going for 18 months and you got $4

725
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,039
million in sales. Well done.

726
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,159
Clearly, you've got everything you need

727
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,880
to run a good business. What extra do

728
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,880
you need from a shark type investor? I

729
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,960
was offered $25 million for the business

730
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,559
probably 6 months ago and I said no

731
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,760
because I I I believe there's a lot more

732
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,240
in it. Marketed correctly, taken through

733
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,840
the right fields and like to to apply

734
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,159
put a different application to it to fit

735
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,279
coffee into it there. I think that's

736
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,279
exactly what a shark could offer.

737
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,519
Kane, you are um very brave. Um also

738
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,720
you've got courage and courage to

739
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,799
actually be allin. So I admire your

740
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,440
passion, your courage, and your bravery.

741
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,039
Thank you. Unfortunately, I own a coffee

742
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,320
business and we sell coffee. I have a

743
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,240
conflict of interest. I'm out. Okay.

744
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,080
Thank you.

745
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,799
Well, I like the space. I think you're

746
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,799
amazing. I'll make you an offer.

747
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,640
I don't like the valuation. I think

748
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,880
there's a risk involved. So, I'm going

749
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:25,240
to offer you $2.5 million for 25% of

750
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,240
your company. Okay?

751
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,919
And I'm going to work on making the

752
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,919
other 75% very valuable. Okay?

753
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:40,000
So, Kane, off to the uh up front with

754
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,559
you. Um, I cannot see even where Andrew

755
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,640
is sitting and and my offer seriously is

756
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,240
2.5 million for 40% based on the work

757
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,159
and the numbers you've told me about.

758
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,480
Okay. I will give you the mentoring and

759
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,279
the coaching support you need to go

760
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,960
exponential with this business.

761
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,559
Thank you. I'm buying your growth rate.

762
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,399
You've started from nothing and in 18

763
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,679
months you got to a phenomenal space.

764
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,519
But I will counter that little

765
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,919
conversation there by saying I am the

766
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,480
scaleup guy. I I am so experienced in

767
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,679
taking companies from small to large. So

768
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,840
it is a dream Australianbased mentor

769
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,840
which is what you need. I'd be there for

770
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,840
you.

771
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,919
So So if you want to take a business

772
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,279
that sells pigs ears and have it sell

773
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,120
more pigs ears, mate, Glenn's your

774
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,480
bloke, right? What?

775
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,399
Um I'm I'm exceptionally curious and

776
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,679
these are these inferior coffee pods you

777
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,440
were selling against. What is it their

778
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,279
cost of manufacturing? The cost of

779
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,880
manufacturing is slightly higher, not a

780
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,440
licensed system and not protected by

781
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,080
patents. So the inferior one which does

782
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,399
things in an inferior way. Yeah. Is more

783
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,080
expensive. Yeah. And that doesn't make

784
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,600
any sense, right? I'll explain. We have

785
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,000
the ability to roast the coffee in

786
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,279
house. So one, you save the GST because

787
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,200
they can buy the green coffee office.

788
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,559
There's no GST on the product and sold.

789
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,640
But it's also the road cost of getting

790
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,480
the coffee there, getting it back to DC

791
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,840
where we can keep it all in house. I I

792
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,679
don't believe you because someone has

793
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,120
the inferior product pods thing and does

794
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,879
exactly everything the way you do it

795
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,320
now. Okay. But anyway,

796
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,079
please I'm speaking. Are you in or out?

797
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,440
I'm speaking. Are you in or out? For

798
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,520
Christ sakes, it's my money. We're here

799
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,520
to talk to the

800
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,599
BL. We're talking about Glenn and

801
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,240
somewhere else. Do you do you need to go

802
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,520
somewhere? Right. You you've actually

803
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,879
identified this as a $2 million

804
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,879
investment. Right. So, and two and a

805
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,440
half. I've made a two and a half.

806
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,879
These do require appropriate

807
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,119
questioning. So if you're trying to rush

808
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,320
the process, why are you trying to rush

809
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,879
the process? And we're talking about

810
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,000
$16.6 million valuation. For God's sake,

811
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,839
it's money, people, and this is

812
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,200
business. So I'm on the I'm on the

813
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,480
fence. I'm going to continue to think,

814
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,679
but it's 2 and a half million bucks. I'm

815
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,639
going to take as much bloody time as I

816
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,520
want. Excuse me.

817
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,879
Okay, Naomi, let's go.

818
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I was going to come in with a different

819
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,639
offer than you've already got from Glenn

820
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,640
and from Andrew because I do know that

821
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,800
you do need the marketing and I value my

822
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,760
marketing skills. So, the offer that I'm

823
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:11,160
going to put you is $2.5

824
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,160
million for 33 and a3% of your business.

825
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,280
Steve,

826
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,359
um I'm having trouble making the

827
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,400
numbers. Okay. I am. I think you you you

828
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,079
we've all said it. You've done

829
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,599
fantastically, right? I've got so much

830
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,040
admiration. You've got a just an

831
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,720
absolute pair between your legs to go

832
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,960
out there and put 16 something million

833
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,200
bucks worth of gear in a confirm in a

834
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,560
factory to to start roasting to attack

835
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,440
the market and to take the market share

836
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,960
you have is is is really fantastic.

837
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,359
So, I'm trying to understand how we can

838
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,200
take this from the the size it is now. I

839
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,720
have a real real trouble with that.

840
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,760
Okay. So, on that, you've got three

841
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,880
offers there. I actually think they're

842
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
terrible offers and you should ditch

843
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,160
them all, but there there's three offers

844
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
on the table. I wish you all the best,

845
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,720
mate, but I'm out. Thank you. See, all

846
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,320
of that and he's out.

847
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,280
Is there someone you want to talk to?

848
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,430
Uh, Beyonce. Yeah. Thank you, guys. Go

849
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,510

A little bit nervous as

852
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,280
I can see. Uh, so yeah, it's difficult.

853
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,440
Like it's

854
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,000
it's they're all they all have really

855
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,160
really good attributes and like I'm sort

856
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,560
of stuck between um them. Can we get the

857
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,560
percentage lower?

858
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:40,580
Um okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Go

859
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,710

Hello. Hi. So, this is Allesia. Um, my

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,760
better half and and the boss of the

864
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,440
boss. Allesia. Beautiful name. Thank

865
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,440
you. Well, you must be very proud of

866
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,400
him, huh? Building a business like that

867
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,040
so quickly. Well, being a better half, I

868
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,800
know I could do better. You mean you

869
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,440
mean you you mean you work just as hard

870
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,800
as he did? Probably harder. Trying to do

871
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,320
my best. Yeah. Fantastic. Kane, you've

872
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,760
had three offers and that's the biggest

873
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,720
amount of money ever been offered in

874
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,839
Shark Tank. 2 and 1/2 million bucks.

875
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,320
That's a first. It's a first. So, where

876
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,920
do you land?

877
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,079
Um Naomi came with with basically the

878
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,160
ability to market with us and also being

879
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,359
local. Glenn with the ability to upscale

880
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,920
um and yourself Andrew you have the

881
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,880
ability for the US and it was really

882
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,200
difficult um where we've come to one um

883
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,200
I I had to still see

884
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:57,079
was we're sitting with Andrew

885
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,119
um I spoke to Allesia and it was to see

886
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,119
if you could do 20% for the 2.5

887
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,440
So, they're out and I'm in and you want

888
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,120

889
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,199

891
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,440
It's $2.5 million. Yes, it is.

892
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:31,320
I'm buying a big growth

893
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:31,320
story. How about 22 and A2?

894
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,440
Let's go. Let's take it to the world.

895
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,000
Well done. Thank you.

896
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,560
Well done. Thank you. Lovely to meet

897
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,079
you. Thank you guys. What an awesome

898
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,720
deal. I know. Great. Well, I'm going to

899
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,160
have the best coffee in town. You are.

900
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,599
You know, at the end of the day, what's

901
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,560
what's important is what the business is

902
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,440
worth in 2 or 3 years. Oh my god, that's

903
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,760
the biggest deal in Shark Tank history.

904
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
I know. It's It's crazy. And I think by

905
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,960
the time it died digest and we're in the

906
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
car and we're heading home, I think it's

907
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
just going to all sort of hit you at

908
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,520
once. I think she's going to have to

909
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,480
drive. How you going to celebrate after

910
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,520
making history? No. Maybe an espresso

911
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,200
martini. A few of them. Yeah, very much

912
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,599
so. Congratulations, guys. Thank you

913
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,920
very much. See you later. See you.

914
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,480
That's awesome. That is the record deal

915
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,720
in Shark Tank history. And it's a risk,

916
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,720
but you know, I just love his competence

917
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,400
and I love his growth rate. And that's

918
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,640
the blue sky I'm buying and I think he

919
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,640
can do it.
