00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
Pinocchio ass [ __ ] if people started

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,200
sure and I know and I know that yeah and

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,360
I know that if Tik Tok actually gets

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,519
erased I haven't talked to Nick and Matt

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,920
about this but I want to film and film

58
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,280
and film and post YouTube video every

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,160
day of the week for one okay yes yeah I

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,640
hear you we'll post some YouTube content

61
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,239
but you're was saying if you guys are

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
making consistent Tik Tok fan edits I

63
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,480
love to see them I I'm not going to be

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,640
sad about Tik Tok being gone but I'm

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,440
going to be sad about the community that

66
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,200
we built over there but M and Chris are

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,760
on Instagram probably more than Tik Tok

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,360
so if Tik Tok does get banned come on

69
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,959
over to Instagram I'm sure that we will

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,519
find you back no matter what happens I'm

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
very very happy with the community we

72
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,440
have here on YouTube me m and Chris have

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
said to since the beginning of our

74
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,400
career that YouTube is our favorite

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,680
platform to post on because we feel that

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,360
you guys actually get to know us and who

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,599
we are and we feel like it's the best

78
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,879
platform for us to be able to

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,840
communicate to you guys talk directly to

80
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,200
you and build a sense of community so as

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
as much as I'll be sad that Tik Tok is

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,760
gone I'm very very happy with what we

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,120
have here just don't touch my

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,080
YouTube I was thinking at some point I

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,879
don't know if you want to do it this

86
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,280
video we should share things that feel

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,920
illegal that isn't like for example I

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
just full sprinted down the street at

89
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,879
3:00 a.m. and I felt like I was going to

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,640
get tackled and arrested by who the

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,360

just changing initials and names yeah

104
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,159

a Ferrari and

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,480

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,640
it that's the craziest thing who do you

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,760

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,560
the three of us I'm not getting into

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,680
that yeah like what that's absolutely

112
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,959
not happening on our YouTube channel

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,880

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,280
with old friends we hadn't seen in

118
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,199
Forever here in Boston Massachusetts I

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
had a

120
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,720
girlfriend in middle school that I

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,639
completely forgot about

122
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,960
yeah and I really think that changes

123
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,479
everything in my life I no cuz nothing

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,639
happened with a girlfriend of course

125
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,400
well we were like 10 and best friends of

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,280
course Nick but that doesn't mean

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,800
anything what the [ __ ]

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,199
okay it's just like really crazy cuz

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,400
like I've so confidently been like oh no

130
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,960

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,120
a girlfriend I had a girlfriend at some

132
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,280
point in like fourth grade for probably

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,680
2 weeks I think that that's actually

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
like a bigger deal than we're making it

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,160
right now that's insane yeah that is

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,919
crazy I was it fully like it like we

137
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,680
were best friends and like we didn't

138
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,680
kiss or touch her fourth graders yeah

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,000
but did you ask her to be your

140
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,800
girlfriend I guess I I didn't remember

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,319

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
blocked it I remember I know but I love

143
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,360
I remembered it and then you would

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
always just say no so I was like I

145
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,360
wasn't saying trauma blonded bonded

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,879
real thing that I fully believe it if I

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,120
had the option at the top of the month

190
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,319

up getting my blood drawn and I would

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,520
choose the Huntsman okay anytime because

203
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,680

keys you paid for a big token you enter

416
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,680

417
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,920
car like like now we're talking now

418
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,440

plastic cards you don't even know the

420
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,160
value of the coin you're putting in the

421
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
machine when you're a kid and you have a

422
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,319
bucket full of [ __ ] coins going to

423
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,000
the arcade and you see each one go and

424
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:52,639
invest into every game you play you know

425
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,680

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,399
card swiping your card you don't know

427
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,959
how much value that has and then you run

428
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,399
out and then you think it's like life

429
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,920
dad put more money on my mom put more

430
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,319

431
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,959
then you go to the store and you start

432
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,039
swiping swiping swiping like it's

433
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,720
nothing cuz then when you go get a prize

434
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,799
and you get that Chinese finger trap

435
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,880
even though it was only 75 tickets you

436
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,799
put that work in you know like I earned

437
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,079
this I feeling like a oh my God I just

438
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,720
had a nostalgic item flood my body with

439
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:29,120
joy wow yes

440
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:32,160
okay a kazoo oh my God top three us

441
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,160
States Maine Maine is up there Maine's

442
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,400
in my Maine might be in my I feel like I

443
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,240
got to go Boston California that's not a

444
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,919
state idiot Massachusetts Sorry God

445
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,280
forbid I got to say Massachusetts no I

446
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,039
think I'm Massachusetts Vermont Maine I

447
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,400
think those are my three New England or

448
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,440
to the day it's so hard I feel like I

449
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,120
have to pick Massachusetts and

450
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,640
California cuz those are where we

451
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,679
reside but it's tough between like

452
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,720
Hawaii Maine Vermont I completely agree

453
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,400
those are my those are are all my third

454
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,679
St I feel like you can find a little bit

455
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,679
of Vermont New Hampshire if you go to

456
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,080
the right place in Massachusetts you can

457
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,280
find a little bit of it all in Maine

458
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,799
plus Beach life you're so true and the

459
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,360
reason I don't want to say Hawaii is

460
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,480
because as much as Hawaii is beautiful

461
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,760
and gorgeous and amazing it just feels

462
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,880
so Co it's so tropical that I feel like

463
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,000
I could find that in other places even

464
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
though I've never really been yeah I

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,760
think I got to give Maine my third slot

466
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,799
top three most annoying things to hear

467
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,760
as a triplet where's Nick where's Chris

468
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,799
if I punched you could Chris feel it or

469
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,520
could Nick feel it those are my top

470
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,520

473
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,840

this I think my vocabulary if I'm see my

495
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,240
vocab comes out best when I'm provoked

496
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,120
if you provoke a [ __ ] good word I'd

497
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,679
be I'd be like oh this is a posterous

498
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,039
but I'm never going to say that but if

499
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,480
