1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
being a Founder is very very stressful

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,520
should I keep going do you have a job do

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,480
you have a career that's going to going

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,200
to work out my suggestion is frankly if

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,920
you feel like you should stop going you

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
should probably stop going and if you

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,639
can't not continue then you should

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,600
continue hey you know this is what you

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,640
need to be doing you need to keep trying

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,720
and all you need is one thing to work

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
out and then that'll you know blow away

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,199
all the failures in the past I have

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
considered giving up many times but

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,359
there was just something nagging inside

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
of me that wouldn't let me interviews

16
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,199
like this is that hey I'm someone who

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,840
already gone through it maybe you can

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
learn from some of my mistakes instead

19
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,360
of going through the same two years of

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,399
pain that I did as well I think you

21
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,239
should stop being lazy and learn how to

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,399
build yourself my name is Marie I the

23
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,920
co-founder and CEO of pylon we're

24
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,760
building the first customer support

25
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,280
platform built for B2B companies we're

26
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,600
going to consolidate all the products

27
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,239
that you would get from a customer

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,320
support platform customer success

29
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,320
platform product marketing I'm tooling

30
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,640
for Solutions and Professional Services

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,000
teams and combine them all into one our

32
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,960
initial Insight was that a lot of people

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
are talking to their customers not over

34
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,199
email anymore but they're starting to

35
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,840
open up shared slack channels Microsoft

36
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,880
teams channels WhatsApp we got to 120k

37
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,720
in AR within 3 months of having the idea

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,880
got our first customer in 14 days we've

39
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,520
raised $20 million from investors like

40
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,280
injuries and Horwitz General Catalyst

41
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,720
and white combinator frankly the vision

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,479
is shaping up so fast um because of

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,479
what's evolving with

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
AI might sound stupid but I was

45
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,560
definitely inspired by movies like The

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,920
Social Network or Pirates of Silicon

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Valley kind of learning about how those

48
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,280
companies got started I guess I could

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,960
relate a little bit to the characters in

50
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,840
the movies where like oh I'm kind of

51
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,640
nerdy too I like computers I like

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,399
programming and maybe this could be a

53
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,280
path I could go on too YouTube videos

54
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,840
were an early teacher for me and then

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,600
started making games and high school

56
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,399
building website then it was only kind

57
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,079
of sophomore year of high school where I

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,920
joined our robotics team where I got

59
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
really excited about after leaving high

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,680
school I went to Purdue to study

61
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,399
computer science I immediately fell in

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,560
love with hacker culture there was this

63
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,719
club prod hackers where every weekend

64
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,280
they would spend time just writing code

65
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,119
and just trying to build games or

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,319
applications while I was in college I

67
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,959
started to do internships of course so I

68
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,319
worked at places like Qualcomm and San

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,519
Diego I worked at Yelp as an intern and

70
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,239
then airb B at airb B and I joined the

71
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,040
payments team there and so I was working

72
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,959
on back in infrastructure helping

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,360
basically money move around the world to

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,879
be honest I don't feel like it prepared

75
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,640
me that much for startups I actually

76
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,000
think it probably was not helpful it was

77
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,840
anti- helpful I learned all the things

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,760
not to do because big companies operate

79
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,239
so differently and so slow compared to

80
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,280
Startup while I was at Airbnb I really

81
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,640
was not enjoying the work I was doing I

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,239
was like looking at all these other

83
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
Founders who were starting companies on

84
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,480
the side even the ones who were failing

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
I was more excited about what they were

86
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,760
doing and the pot they were on than what

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
I was doing at airb be when I left airb

88
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,720
B I started working on one idea which

89
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
was a health Tech idea we were trying to

90
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,599
build an app for people with Parkinson's

91
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,159
disease to better understand their

92
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
condition it was a terrible idea for a

93
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,200
lot of reasons and we spent a whole year

94
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,200
on it the end I decided to Pivot not

95
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,080
only away from the idea and the industry

96
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
of Health Tech in general but also the

97
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,879
co-founder I was working with even when

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
I started working with my now

99
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,840
co-founders adith and Robert we spent

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,640
months pivoting together until we

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
finally came up with

102
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,080
pylon what we were interested in doing

103
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,040
was building a really big fast growing

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,400
company I have considered giving up many

105
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,680
times I think in the back of your head

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,640
you're always questioning okay should I

107
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,200
keep going but there was just something

108
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,799
nagging inside of me that wouldn't let

109
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,040
me hey you know this is what you need to

110
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,000
be doing you need to keep trying and all

111
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,959
you need is one thing to work out and

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,599
then that'll you know blow away all the

113
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,280
failures in the past pivoting is really

114
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,080
really hard you are going to Pivot a lot

115
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,680
and you're going to Pivot so much that

116
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,080
my co-founders and I we call it pivot

117
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,599
hell now once you actually get into

118
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,239
pivot hell and you start working with

119
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,799
people and every week you might be

120
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,439
switching ideas it becomes really really

121
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,760
hard to keep going your parents are

122
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,319
going to ask you what you're doing with

123
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,319
your life your girlfriend or boyfriend

124
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,319
are going to question hey like should

125
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,799
you maybe start looking for a real job

126
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,840
and you're also going to have this like

127
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,439
creeping doubt that hey maybe I'm not

128
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
actually good at this and uh should I

129
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,159
keep going my suggestion is frankly if

130
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
you feel like you should stop going you

131
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,000
should probably stop going and if you

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,040
can't not continue then you should

133
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,400
continue and that was the case for me I

134
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,199
basically didn't feel like I had a

135
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,959
choice I had to keep going because

136
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,720
that's just how my brain is wired one of

137
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,400
the learnings for us was you just have

138
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
to start in a really really big Market

139
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,600
what type of idea you want to be working

140
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,240
on to make something really big that can

141
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,520
grow really fast what we did was we kind

142
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,280
of like observed the biggest software

143
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,320
companies in the world and turns out

144
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,919
there aren't that many public SAS

145
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,680
companies if you look at them like

146
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,680
they're probably 76 uh Billion Dollar

147
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,880
Plus public software companies that are

148
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,759
B2B and of them almost all of them are

149
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,680
horizontal SAS products meaning hey

150
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,560
they're selling uh products that can be

151
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,520
sold into almost any industry so think

152
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,080
like payroll it sales marketing customer

153
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,080
support Etc we decided okay let's to

154
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,720
make sure we don't get stuck in a market

155
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,600
let's go after something really big so

156
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,160
we chose kind of post sales customer

157
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,199
support as a category to go explore what

158
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,520
we did was we went on LinkedIn And We

159
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,600
messaged uh 40 people a day that's what

160
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,320
LinkedIn would let you do let's say 7%

161
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,960
of those people respond you know would

162
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,120
create a cycle of us just cold

163
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,000
interviewing people in Customer Support

164
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,160
roles that we wanted to learn from I

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,840
think you need to be very clear with

166
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,199
yourself what type of company you want

167
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,280
to build we wanted to build something

168
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,919
explicitly very big and for us that

169
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,600
meant a $10 billion market cap public

170
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,479
company that was making let's say a

171
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,199
billion dollars in revenues and also

172
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,840
fast growing meant that usually there's

173
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,039
some sort of emerging Trend that's

174
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
happening in the world where you can

175
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,360
capture that and grow with it so where

176
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,520
we saw this emerging trend of B2B

177
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,479
communication moving away from email to

178
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,280
kind of new channels if I were going

179
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,120
through and trying to find ideas now the

180
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,919
strategy we used I think can be

181
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
effective for other people we basically

182
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,880
decided okay we're going to explore the

183
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,520
customer support and success space um

184
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,400
you know kind of horizontal category and

185
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,880
then within it we said we're going to go

186
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,680
and cold interview people also at the

187
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,759
same time a was popping up and turns out

188
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
all the data is flowing through pylon is

189
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
conversational so now for the first time

190
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,720
ever There's an opportunity to structure

191
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,400
it who have newer types of roles so like

192
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,919
new job titles that didn't exist let's

193
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,479
say 10 years ago a lot of customer

194
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,759
success managers support Engineers

195
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,720
Solutions Engineers those people didn't

196
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,599
exist 5 years ago now they did so we

197
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,599
thought hey new roles might mean new

198
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,520
workflows which means new software and

199
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,520
maybe there's opportunity

200
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,280
there the best time to raise a series a

201
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
is when you're going to get the terms if

202
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,039
investors are pounding on your door even

203
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,880
if you haven't hit a certain Revenue

204
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,560
Milestone it might be the right time to

205
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,520
just go and take that we raised our $3.2

206
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
million seed rone from General Catalyst

207
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,479
in 6 days that's a catchy headline and

208
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
and it did really feel like we were

209
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,360
living in an episode of Silicon Valley

210
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,280
the story is we were 2 months into our

211
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,680
YC batch 3 months old as a company

212
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,479
overall we were probably around like

213
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,000
60,000 in annual revenue at the time 2

214
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,639
months into YC that's when people start

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
to think about fundraising bring on

216
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,879
investors before the end of the batch

217
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,120
well we did was we scheduled as many

218
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,599
calls with VC's in the course of one

219
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,360
week tried to create some sort of like

220
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,039
time pressure between the investors

221
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,080
themselves spreading it out basically

222
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,199
going in with the mentality and kind of

223
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,000
signaling to every investor hey yeah

224
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
we're fundraising really hard this week

225
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,479
and there might not be time for

226
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,759
conversations next week so we kind of

227
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,120
need to knock everything out uh right

228
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,520
now all at once every time we got in

229
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,080
touch with an investor it was important

230
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,759
how they heard about us so instead of

231
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,919
just like cold emailing investors

232
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
directly saying hey we're pil on like

233
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,319
you should invest in us we instead got

234
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,800
Founders that they respected and knew um

235
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,879
some that were even our customers

236
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,680
already go message them and say hey VC I

237
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,120
know this founder the founder pylon

238
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,199
they're going to YC right now are you

239
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,800
talking to them yet you should because

240
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,120
they're a hot company I think what

241
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,000
they're working on is really good we got

242
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,280
a bunch of really great introductions

243
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,159
through that and that just meant that

244
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,400
the investors were coming directly to us

245
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,000
like basically ready uh to have serious

246
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,599
conversations and we'd skip straight to

247
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,479
partner meetings the social proof was

248
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,120
just already there and at seed round

249
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,599
social proof is everything your business

250
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,520
is still so nent it's so hard to kind of

251
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,919
understand you know where you're going

252
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,759
to go so having Founders vouch for you

253
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,280
who the investor trust is is really

254
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,039
really important to give you a sense of

255
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,360
the timeline here so we start our

256
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,680
initial conversations with investors on

257
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,039
I guess it was a Monday Wednesday is

258
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,560
when we had our first discussion with

259
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,479
General Catalyst who eventually let our

260
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,560
seed Dr Friday we had in-person partner

261
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,560
meeting with General Catalyst uh

262
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,360
investors and then Saturday went to the

263
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,120
apartment of one of the investors uh

264
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,120
went to the roof had like kind of a

265
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,560
social conversation and by night time

266
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,719
that same day they gave us uh a verbal

267
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,959
offer that they wanted to invest the

268
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,279
general advice that we got was hey find

269
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,560
people who are good partners for the

270
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,080
long term who have a reputable brand um

271
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,839
that brand then helps you bring on

272
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,519
employees because you have that social

273
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,720
proof and then we'll also help you you

274
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,320
know close customers they can help you

275
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,120
get investors for the next round so

276
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,800
General Catalyst was basically the top

277
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,240
of our list and so we were going after

278
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,480
funds like them to for for the seed run

279
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,680
the whole process took around 14 days at

280
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,600
the end of 14 days we ended up closing

281
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,800
with andreon um who led a $17 million

282
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,640
series a run the process of like talking

283
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,399
to all those investors was not easy they

284
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,839
actually tried to fill your calendar as

285
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,279
much as possible to make sure that you

286
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,880
don't talk to other people once they

287
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,399
express interest because there's only

288
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,800
downside for them to wait if they

289
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,040
express interest then they know that

290
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,640
other investors will suddenly get

291
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,279
interested just because of that like

292
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,959
social Dynamic low dilution was the

293
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,120
thing that was really important for us

294
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,200
we just didn't want to sell 25% of the

295
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,920
company the only way to get low dilution

296
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,240
is to have a competitive round we want

297
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,880
INRI into better terms then you have to

298
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,440
go to someone else they respect so you

299
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,519
have to go to like a benchmark or

300
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,160
Sequoia and andri has to feel like

301
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,959
they're going to lose you if they do not

302
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,480
lower the dilution amount it's kind of

303
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,839
this like social game where they need to

304
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,440
make the terms better for you and the

305
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,839
company when he was trying to figure out

306
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,079
how to have a good fundraise he

307
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,240
basically was like okay how do you have

308
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,640
a fundraise fast like the Twitter guys

309
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,160
that was the example he gave and so he

310
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,079
asked investors he's like why did the

311
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,519
Twitter guys have such a fast fundraise

312
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,399
there are actually no secrets it's you

313
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,079
have to have a really good team building

314
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,880
in a really big Market with a really

315
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,440
good product that people love and you

316
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,000
know high potential for growth you have

317
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
all those things you've kind of already

318
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,040
done all the work here are the numbers

319
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
here's the growth rate here's you know

320
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,920
what customers are saying and they're

321
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,880
just going to be convinced based off of

322
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,480
that so really just the fundamentals are

323
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,480
what's actually

324
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,920
important basically riding a big wave

325
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,320
and then we have the founder SL compan

326
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,680
that's a a great Surfer and so as a

327
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,600
result you can surf the the big wave hi

328
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,079

Ventures and also co-author of uh

330
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,360
survival to thrival I started working in

331
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,200
Silicon Valley in 1985 and then uh

332
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,320
started storm in 2000 we've invested in

333
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,880
uh over 200 B2B software companies since

334
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,360
then of which 12 have become unicorns

335
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,399
probably the best knowns are like

336
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,000
maretto we also have uh unicorns like

337
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:01,160
Vado techon algolia pipe drive and so

338
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,399
forth want to talk to you about what

339
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,120
happens after you unlock growth in other

340
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,440
words you've spent all this effort to

341
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,680
catch the wave and how do you stay on

342
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,680
the

343
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,079
way I hope that everyone that's in a

344
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,399
startup recognizes that it's a an

345
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,000
emotional roller coaster where you can

346
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,680
go from the highest of highs the lowest

347
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
of lows in 5 minutes and so in those

348
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,240
moments I hope you realize life is never

349
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,280
so bad or never were so good and at the

350
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:40,539
end uh enjoy the

351
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,539
[Music]

352
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
journey when you're competing against

353
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,399
incumbent you're not actually competing

354
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,760
with all the employees there most of

355
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,600
them are not working on R&D most of them

356
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,040
actually do not care because you know

357
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,639
they're just getting a paycheck we were

358
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,959
at the time especially living in the

359
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,440
office working 14-hour days the number

360
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,720
of people grinding at Zenda trying to

361
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,519
accomplish the same thing is very few I

362
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,480
think at this stage what has worked for

363
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,000
us in terms of what the founder should

364
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,440
be doing and what leader should look

365
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,440
like is just doing the work yourself so

366
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,000
leadership at pylon is very much just

367
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,880
doing the work yourself and other people

368
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,560
kind of following by example so like 6

369
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
months ago we were actually living at

370
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,440
the office it was like Robert had a bed

371
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,120
in the living room and that you know

372
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,079
everyone just had desk surrounding or

373
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,639
our salesperson his desk that he would

374
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,440
take sales calls out was literally like

375
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,839
5T away from had this bed I was like

376
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,800
sleeping in a meeting room for us

377
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,480
leadership just meant doing the work and

378
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,519
then people kind of seeing that kind of

379
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,959
being motivated and excited by by that

380
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,360
being a Founder is very very stressful

381
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,120
at the end of every month that's when we

382
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,040
do our reporting on how much revenue and

383
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,839
how quickly we've grown we keep doing it

384
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,440
and part of me feels like oh my God this

385
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,839
is magical it just keeps happening but

386
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,920
it's very stressful I think the only way

387
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,839
through the stress is by just addressing

388
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,560
the problems and grinding really really

389
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,160
hard so you can more consistently

390
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,760
maintain growth and you know hiring

391
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,399
Pipeline and building great product both

392
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,519
myself and and I think my co-founders

393
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,240
feel very similarly where we just want

394
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,199
to win we want to build a company and so

395
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,560
we just didn't let ourselves give

396
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:14,079
up I think the really important thing is

397
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,000
to be able to build and solve problems

398
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,560
yourself say heyy I'm just going to go

399
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
find let's say a technical co-founder

400
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,240
who will build the product for me I

401
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,600
think you should stop being lazy and

402
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,120
learn how to build yourself there are

403
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,240
lots of resources on how to do it you

404
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,360
could go watch YouTube like I did go to

405
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,880
a boot camp or any free courses that

406
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
exists around the world at this point

407
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,440
just learn how to build for yourself

408
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
especially with AI it's becoming so easy

409
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,920
then the world is your oyster you can

410
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,839
have an idea make it and then just try

411
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,120
it and see what happens so first off if

412
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,800
you're not like purely set on starting a

413
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,120
company immediately I do actually

414
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
recommend just trying to get a job at a

415
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,240
startup you can create a network and

416
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
kind of like be immersed in the startup

417
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,839
community so for example you work at

418
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,079
pylon we have events here all the time

419
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,880
for Founders and um other startups that

420
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,320
are coming through so you just have an

421
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,639
opportunity to mingle with a bunch of

422
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
people if you are just set on starting a

423
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,199
company immediately I would probably go

424
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,680
live in a hacker House of some sort I

425
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:06,120
would probably just attend a lot of

426
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,800
Meetup YC has meetups now and events I

427
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,639
would just go to as many of those as you

428
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,320
could find the best people and then try

429
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,519
to get into their networks I would

430
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,399
probably tell myself learn from others

431
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,279
more I think I'm one of those people

432
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,759
that often likes to just go figure

433
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,240
things out on my own which I think is

434
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,199
really helpful but I think there's also

435
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,199
a lot of advice for example I could have

436
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,720
gone to successful entrepreneurs and

437
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,560
been like hey what do you think of my

438
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,720
idea like is this good what do you think

439
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,959
are the risks whatever and I gotten to

440
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,880
the same point 2 years later in months

441
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,519
had I just like listened to their advice

442
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,079
taken that instead of just trying to

443
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,720
like discover everything on my own

444
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,880
interviews like this is that hey I'm

445
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,240
someone who's already gone through it

446
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,680
maybe you can learn from some of my

447
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,600
mistakes instead of going through the

448
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,360
same two years of pain that I did as

449
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,000
well so that would be one piece of

450
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,079
advice is just go learn from other

451
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
people who have done it before and are a

452
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,000
couple years ahead of you
