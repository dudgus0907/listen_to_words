1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
If you're not embarrassed by your first

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,759
version, you shipped to late in AI. I

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,680
would even go as far as to say like if

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,240
your first version works, you're not

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,160
thinking big enough. You should build

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
for the future generations of the model

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
so much and the models are improving so

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,840
rapidly that the current generation of

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,520
models should barely support your

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
vision. Just barely. If you spend any

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,199
time on Twitter, you feel like there is

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,640
so much competition in AI agents. You

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,000
feel like there is a new a new company

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
coming out every week. And yet when

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,080
you're out in the market like us, you

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,599
don't run into competitors that often.

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,360
So I sometimes compare it to like

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,120
there's like trillions of trillions of

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,760
stars in the universe and yet the

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,120
universe is 99.9% empty space. It's the

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
same, right? There's a lot of us

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
nominally, but somehow it feels empty.

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
And I think because the market is just

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,039
so enormously huge. These people have

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
gone about their entire life hearing

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
everyone tell them the reason why they

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
couldn't do things. But actually, if you

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,520
do it, you're going to be very, very

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
successful. You're going to make a lot

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,680
of money. you're going to build

31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
something very impactful with the twof

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,719
world. It becomes addictive. It's like a

33
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,359
ha like tell me you can't I can't do it.

34
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,359
I'll show you I can.

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
I'm Flo Killo. I'm the CEO of Lindy

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,560
which is the world's easiest way to

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,799
build AI agents with no code. Lindy is a

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,200
setup of building blocks that you can

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,880
put together to build your own AI agents

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,720
and to get them to do anything. One big

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
use case that we have is a customer

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
support. Step one, customer support

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
ticket arrives by email. Step two, you

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
can have a condition building block that

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,400
basically branches up the agent. So you

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
can be like, hey, is this a customer

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
asking a question or is this a customer

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,119
asking for a refund? Step three, for

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,040
example, if they're asking a question,

50
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,360
you can use our knowledge base building

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,439
block, your FAQ, your website, a PDF,

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,520
your notion, whatever you want. Then you

53
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,000
can ask maybe finally step four to

54
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
answer the support ticket based on the

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,759
knowledge that it extracted in the

56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
knowledge base. We have quintupled uh in

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,960
revenue over the last 6 months and

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,200
roughly doubled the size of the team

59
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,200
since then.

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
I think it's Jeff Bezos who said

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
something like people always comment

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
about how fast everything is always

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
changing like he likes to focus on what

64
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
doesn't change right in a world thing is

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,239
always changing it finds these pillars

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
of stability to hang on to and I think

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
what doesn't change is the user and a

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,440
lot of preferences of the user will just

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
immutable that really surprised us. We

70
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,760
released the platform and we started to

71
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
have quite a few users ask us for HIPPA

72
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,920
compliance which is this regulatory

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,760
standard in the US that allows you to

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,200
work with sensitive health information.

75
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,319
So people started to be like can you be

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,520
HIPPA compliant? Can you be HIPPA

77
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,200
compliant? I want to use legal for

78
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,800
healthcare use cases. And we were like

79
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,160
why like what do what do you want us to

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
be HIPPA compliant for? And that's when

81
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
we we understood the use case which is

82
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,120
turns out it's huge and it's a big

83
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
industry today. There's a lot of really

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
big companies dedicated solely to this

85
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
use case where doctors spend a lot of

86
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,480
time taking notes during patient visits.

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
They call it charting because there's

88
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,239
like a very specific standard of notes

89
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,080
that they call soap notes. Some of them

90
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,319
started building Lindy's to help them

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
build get their soap notes. So they use

92
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,680
Lindy on a mobile phone and they

93
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
recorded the conversation using the

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
record feature that we have and then

95
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
they would prompt Lindy to give them the

96
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
format of notes. In the case of AI

97
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,120
agents, the user wants something that's

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,319
easy to use. We want something that's

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,599
effective, something that works,

100
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
something that's simple to use,

101
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,080
something that's affordable, something

102
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
that's fast. These things are always

103
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
going to be the case. And the problem

104
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,239
that the user is trying to solve is is

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,239
fairly constant as well.

106
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
LinkedIn's founder Hoffman, who said

107
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
this famous thing, if you're not

108
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
embarrassed by your first version, you

109
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
shipped too late in AI. I would even go

110
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
as far as to say like if your first

111
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,480
version works, you're not thinking big

112
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
enough. You should build for the future

113
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,319
generations of the model. so much and

114
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,319
the models are improving so rapidly that

115
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
the current generation of models should

116
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,239
barely support your vision just barely.

117
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,319
That was very much our case at Lindy

118
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
like for a long time the product simply

119
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,239
did not work because the models were not

120
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
good enough. The very first version of

121
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
the product was just a prompt. So

122
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
instead of building this AI agent using

123
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
these building blocks that I mentioned,

124
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,920
it was literally just writing text.

125
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
Because it's just a prompt, you're just

126
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
trusting this AI model to basically

127
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
follow your instructions. It may not

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,680
follow the instructions. You're you're

129
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,519
like praying the LM gods. Even to this

130
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,439
day, even to the frontier models, like

131
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,200
fast forward two or three years, to this

132
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,040
day, Claude Opus 4 or OpenAI, I use the

133
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,040
very most frontier models right now,

134
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,639
even they very often struggle. We are

135
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
building for the next generation of

136
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,919
models. The current product doesn't work

137
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
and yet we keep building because we

138
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
expect that the next generation of

139
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
models will make it work. And the way I

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
characterize it today is it's it's sort

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,880
of AI in turn. It can perform simple

142
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
enough tasks. Anything that you can

143
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,800
describe in a step-by-step uh fashion is

144
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
something that that Lindy can do. Over

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
the long term, the vision is to build a

146
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
full-blown AI employees, an AI agent

147
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
that can do anything that the human

148
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
employee can do on a computer. So,

149
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
that's my piece of advice is like skate

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
for the puck is going to be in in Steve

151
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
Jobs world and skate for where the the

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,400
next generation of models is going to be

153
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,400
and build with that in mind.

154
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
Don't build a mine until you've you've

155
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
found gold. I really identified these

156
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,520
two different distinct phases in a

157
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
startup life cycle. One, you prospect.

158
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
You look for the right mining site where

159
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,440
you can find gold. And once you've

160
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
struck gold, but only then do you build

161
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
a mine. And building a mine is basically

162
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
hiring a team and raising money and all

163
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,280
of that stuff. It is really hard to move

164
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
a mine. And so if if you build too large

165
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
a mine and you haven't found gold, what

166
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
you need to do is you need to destroy

167
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,759
your mine. You need to fire your team.

168
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
So I started at Uber as a software

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,840
engineer. I took a six months break

170
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
after Uber. So COVID breakout, everybody

171
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
was stuck at home. So I was just on my

172
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
computer at home and I I read a blog

173
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,600
post by John Palmer called the spatial

174
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
interfaces sort of extolling the virtues

175
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
of of spatial design. And there's almost

176
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
a call to action in that blog post

177
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,759
that's like I wonder what a special zoom

178
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,960
would look like. I was like oh it's a

179
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,720
good question like I started like

180
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
hacking it together and in the span of a

181
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,840
couple of hours they just had like a

182
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,520
prototype of like a special zoom. It's

183
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,960
like you see your video in a bubble. You

184
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,560
can move the bubble around on like a two

185
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
dimensional canvas and you can only hear

186
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
and be held by people around you. And

187
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
again, this coincided perfectly with

188
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
COVID. And so I started hosting virtual

189
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
happy hours in there with my friends

190
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,759
like, "Hey, join me in that space. I I

191
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,600
built and I sort of got sucked in little

192
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
by little. I just kept adding features

193
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
and I realized it could be like a

194
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
collaboration space. I added a

195
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
whiteboard and so forth. And then I

196
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
realized like oh my god, like

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
everybody's working remotely right now.

198
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
Like you know this could be a virtual

199
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
office. Like there is a market here." I

200
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
released it. It got traction. like bunch

201
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,800
of users started sagging up, raised some

202
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,400
money and then like the company was just

203
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,560
after the races. When COVID subsided and

204
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,479
when people returned to the office, Team

205
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,039
Flow started not going so well and the

206
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,560
growth stalled completely. What finally

207
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,720
convinced me that there was simply no

208
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,880
market anymore was like looking around

209
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,520
and seeing all the competitors of which

210
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,039
we had many like good teams like really

211
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
good people and they had raised a lot of

212
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
money and none of them were taking off.

213
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
So that's when I just realized like

214
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
there is no there is no market. That's

215
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,960
what I did. It was extremely painful,

216
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,759
but I fired twothirds of the team and it

217
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,160
coincided with the release of the GPT3

218
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,440
API. So, it was before the GPT. It was

219
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,680
like mid 2022 and we built a meeting

220
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,160
recorder in team flow and we were very

221
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,000
interested in the GP3 API and so we were

222
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
like what can we do with it? So, we we

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
did what now a lot of applications do

224
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,759
which is a meeting summarization. And

225
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
then sales team came to me and they were

226
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
like flow can this thing also update our

227
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
sales force after sales calls and we

228
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
were like sure I don't see why not. And

229
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,880
so we basically kept building and kept

230
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
fleshing out that like Salesforce

231
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
integration and then HubSpot integration

232
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
and and that's when it clicked for us

233
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
like we realized like wait a minute we

234
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,880
can get the LLM to not just generate

235
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,800
text for us but generate API calls like

236
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
generate actual actions for us and so

237
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
that's when we were like wait a minute

238
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,240
like this can be like an an entire AI

239
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,720
employee basically we got sucked in to

240
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,120
that and again it coincided with first

241
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
team flow stalling out we got excited

242
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
about this AI thing jp came about in the

243
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
middle exploded and like oh my god like

244
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,479
AI is real it's happening and so we just

245
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
decided in 2023 to completely fool the

246
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,400
team flow and just focus on the AI

247
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,759
opportunity and and I I did that very

248
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
deliberately and it's painful as a

249
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,840
founder you need to deliberately

250
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
mismanage your team you need to let them

251
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
alone and they're going to hate you like

252
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
where is our CEO what's he doing all day

253
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm looking for gold like the mind

254
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
doesn't matter the mind is so very

255
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,720
mismanaged right now and you guys are

256
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
lost at sea and I decide not to care

257
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
because I'm going to spend my time

258
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
digging for gold um that's that's what I

259
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't don't don't build a mind before

260
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,000
you you found the gold.

261
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
My leadership philosophy is the job of a

262
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
CEO is to win. And so that that's my

263
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
guiding light. Epistemologically that is

264
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,519
how I will define what is right or

265
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
wrong. Perhaps I would compare it to

266
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,719
gardening. You know it starts with like

267
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,159
selecting the seeds. So I really do

268
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,760
believe like half the job is just

269
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,360
recruiting like getting the right people

270
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,440
into the door. Like again I think it's

271
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,880
Kra Boy who said the people you hire is

272
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
the company you build. and I'm reminded

273
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
every day of how true that is. It's half

274
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,680
the job. So just getting the right

275
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,200
seeds. If you don't have that, the plant

276
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
won't be good. And then giving a

277
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
direction to the team and to the seed

278
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
like that's the sign. You grow in this

279
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
direction, you know. So that's that's

280
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,920
the second big part of the job is just

281
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
setting the vision and guiding the plant

282
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,240
as it grows, but you can't grow for the

283
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,680
plant. Plant won't grow the way you want

284
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,279
it to. So you've got to fire people.

285
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,959
There's this amazing book by Bill Walsh

286
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,240
called The School Takes of Itself,

287
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,160
right? And so the philosophy of Bill

288
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Walsh is like success consists of just

289
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
two things. one, identifying the right

290
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
inputs that lead to success. And two,

291
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
nailing each and every one of these

292
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,800
inputs perfectly, right? If you do these

293
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,920
two things, you will win. If you don't

294
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
win, it means you either don't

295
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
understand what it takes to win or

296
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
you're not doing what it takes to win.

297
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,519
That's just one of these two things. And

298
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
so, it's actually funny. We on boarded a

299
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,880
new employee this morning. He's the

300
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
first one of his function. And I spent

301
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,640
the day yesterday, Sunday, like

302
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,279
literally seven plus hours just writing

303
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,040
an 18 pages long document about this is

304
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,720
precisely exactly we we call it a

305
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,200
standard of excellence. Step by step by

306
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
step. This is the job. Again, that's the

307
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
plan. It's like if you if you see them

308
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
doing something wrong, it's like no.

309
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
It's like your guard is like, "No, this

310
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
is not what you this is not what this is

311
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,480
what you do." And you just keep putting

312
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
these guardrails and you refer back to

313
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
the dock that you wrote. Absolutely, you

314
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,519
should micromanage. The reason why you

315
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,080
are in a position of of of authority is

316
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,080
because someone with capital most likely

317
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
trusted you and your taste. So you you

318
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,440
are entitled, you are in fact obligated

319
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,959
to micromanage. That that's why you're

320
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
in your seat. You exercise your taste.

321
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,760
You exercise your judgment. You exercise

322
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
your your knowledge about your business,

323
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,959
your industry, your user, your product,

324
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,959
and you guide the plant. That's my

325
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,959
philosophy.

326
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,440
I view building a company as a way to

327
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,320
bring an ambitious bold vision to

328
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,120
reality. I don't think the Lin startup

329
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,120
model leads you there. I'm a huge fan of

330
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,360
Peter Thiel's thinking on this. He calls

331
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,880
it definite optimism. It's like a 2x2.

332
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,800
You've got a definite and indefinite and

333
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,640
optimism and pessimism. And so definite

334
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,920
or indefinite is like do you know or do

335
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,399
you not know? There's a lot of

336
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,880
indefinite optimists in tech. I view

337
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,800
crypto as the the eternal indefinite

338
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
optimist industry. It's like we don't

339
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
know what's going to happen. We don't

340
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,560
know why things are going to go well,

341
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,680
but wag me, we're all going to make it.

342
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,200
You know, everything's going to go so

343
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,200
well, but we we can't exactly tell you

344
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,360
half. Instead, Peter Tiel pushes for

345
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,480
this vision of a definite optimism.

346
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,399
Like, you must have a crisp opinion, a

347
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
well-defined opinion of what the world

348
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,040
will look like in the future, what it

349
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,360
should look like, what it must look

350
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,720
like, and bring that vision to life.

351
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
What percent of your time did you spend

352
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,200
in 2022 speaking to an AI? It was 0%.

353
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,640
Today in 2025, it's it's a lot more than

354
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
that. And I think the trend is going to

355
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
continue and continue and continue. AI

356
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
agents are basically in the short term

357
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,079
going to turn us all into managers.

358
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,640
Instead of doing individual contributor

359
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,040
work, you're going to manage a swoop of

360
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,320
AI agents doing your work. I sometimes

361
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,560
describe it as like imagine if any

362
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,200
random 25year-old could have the same

363
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,279
impact in the world as Google. And so I

364
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,519
I think that AI agents are going to do

365
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,360
to the world of business at large what

366
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,480
the internet has done to media. It's

367
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,079
going to be a very powerful leveling of

368
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
the playing field. It's going to unlock

369
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,959
opportunity to for everyone regardless

370
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,120
of their network or their capital or

371
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,360
their access or their geography. It's

372
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
just really going to come down to their

373
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,720
vision and the ideas they have and their

374
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,720
ability to leverage AI agents.
