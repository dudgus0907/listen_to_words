00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,659
like 2011. so we just said that I got

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,100
major flashbacks all right go ahead if

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,740
I'll give you my blueberry little bites

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,740

23
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,799

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,299

can I get a sip of the Pepsi please I

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
think next time you go on a tour we

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,440
should manipulate one of the mics to be

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,120
like super different voice like imagine

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,280
if Matt went out and he was like just

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,780
sound like a little girl

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,580
I thought we were gonna manipulate the

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,560
mics to sound like different voices no

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,580
like that's what it would be that was my

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,020
joke

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,480

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
by all his hands no like do you know how

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,900

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,540
like the green yeah

99
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,620
I'm trying to think about it and I

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,600
really can't

101
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,240
you wanna know what what's a little

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,979
funny to me what you know how like Apple

103
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,180
products are always changing their their

104
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,740
Chargers and stuff so that when you

105
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,360
upgrade your phone and you gotta look at

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,520
the different wire you know like drills

107
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,020
and screwdrivers and stuff yeah why why

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,020
didn't they make all one drill

109
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,440
because like why maybe they did why so

110
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,340
why make funny why make I don't find

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,620
this funny but why make some of them

112
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,780
they're all all drills change

113
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,400
why make some flat heads though like

114
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,840
screwdrivers like why make some of the

115
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,280
screws flatheads and then some Phillips

116
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,440
heads because at the end of the day

117
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,880
you're screwing in no matter what so

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,740
what does it matter the grid they should

119
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,900
have just made one universal

120
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,199
thing

a Target okay they'd be Pop-Tarts or

172
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,220
Pop-Tart but is it like a strudel or is

173
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840

193
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,240
I feel like there's only one

194
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,060
circumstance where you're allowed to

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,039
judge somebody and and it's whatever

196
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,820

that's the only way you could judge

212
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,580
people I think there's far we can judge

213
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,700
people about other than their contacts

214
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,959

same time you're so stupid but no I

218

genuinely do think that that's the

219
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,600
second time I hurt myself in the car

220
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,600
um

221
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,160
okay how long would you have to be

222
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,459
dating somebody to just drop a [ __ ]

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,720
right in front of them in front yeah I

224
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,160
don't think I could I don't think my

225
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,420
body would let me look they're in the

226
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
bathroom with you and you dropped a

227
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,839
stinky like wait like in a relationship

228
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
wise is that what you're saying so I

229
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,779
didn't get that would be the whole

230
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,640
question yeah

231
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,640
God oh man

232
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,580
ew Chris that's such a mad thing oh man

233
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,180
crazy one

234
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,500
it's crazy

235
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,899
I said this in a car video before but I

236
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,519
think it's so important though it wasn't

237
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,399
gonna be in a plane crash it needs to

238
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,260
happen right during takeoff I agree like

239
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,060
imagine you seamlessly get through an

240
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,399
entire flight and it's like a 12 hour

241
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,260
flight to like a foreign country and as

242
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,519
the plane is landing it crashes well

243
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,740
most of the time I'm playing crashes

244
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,820
it's on takeoff or Landing so it's a 50.

245
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,260
yeah but it's like bro it's like you

246
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,519
never really we're gonna crash once

247
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,720
you're in the middle of the air it's

248
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,279
like really bro she's like imagine

249
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,779
you're in like first class and like you

250
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,180
just got served your drinks and then the

251
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,279
plane crash and there's like drinks I

252
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,079
think natural disasters are crazy that's

253
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,720
what I say I think it's crazy that like

254
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:00,480
an earthquake can just like Rumble like

255
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,860
if you see a drink like like my first

256
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,860
initials who's tapping their foot

257
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,279
foreign

258
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,600
have to like take a second and be like

259
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,220
okay like I'm a person watching this

260
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,220
movie like I'm not a part of this at all

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,700
oh well that would mean they're doing a

262
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,700
good job backing it out

263
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,800
okay whatever

264
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,079
just can't believe that stuck around

316
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,579
usually Abracadabra something someone

317
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:15,180
they like lose it you know what is

319
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,380

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,839
they should use it in court then what is

325
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,220

the snap attack yeah it doesn't

391
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,420

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,420
head they're like what are you doing

393
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,699

[Applause]

401
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,880
I don't like that like do we only have a

402
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,340
term for dozen is 12. do you all know

403
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,799

404
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,820
six stupid yeah and then [ __ ] two

405
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,919
dozens a Baker's dozens 12.

406
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,559
it's gonna still be 12. oh I don't think

407
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,360
so it's not a Baker's Dozen still 12.

408
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,360
what's a baker's dozen

13. 13

410
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,620
