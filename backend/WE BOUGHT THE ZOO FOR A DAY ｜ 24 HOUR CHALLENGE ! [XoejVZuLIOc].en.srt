All right, y'all. Welcome to the car

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,600
video section of this video. We're going

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
to pop in and out and just talk about

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,240
what's what we're experiencing. The meat

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,880
and potatoes. The meat and potatoes. But

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,200
the you might see us just jump in every

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
now and again. But that's Is it now and

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,920
then? Every now and then. You always say

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
now and again. And it like infuriates

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279
you like I just want to beat you up cuz

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,880
like now and then is like giving It's

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
like every now and then. Now or later.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,199
You now and again. Right now. And it's

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,720
going to happen as well. Well, it could

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,559
happen again is my thought process.

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
Yeah, I think you're like making up a

17
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,320
new term that just looks a lot like

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,800
something that's a thing. I works. No,

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
it's just way too chunky. Like every now

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,399
and again. I'll see you now and now now

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
and then. Every now and again. No, now

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
and again is not the same. I'll see you

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,039
every time you say that. I actually

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,680
fight the urge to like hit you. Like

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,360
it's annoying. But anyway, you guys you

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,520

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,199

Boom. All right, guys. Welcome back to

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
the Stern Triplet YouTube channel.

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,240
Today, we are doing something that we

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
have never done before. Something a

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,079
little different. Something a little

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,079
extra with a little pizzazz and flare.

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,479
Yeah, exactly. Basically, this video,

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,280
me, Matt, and Nick splurged and spent a

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,880
good amount of money. Hold on. And we

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,040
bought out the entire Roar Safari Park

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
at the San Diego Zoo today. No

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
sponsorship with San Diego Zoo. No

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,599
partnership or anything. We're just

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
doing this all for fun. I wish there was

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
a sponsorship. We put a [ __ ] bag down

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
to do this. But we hit 6 million

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
subscribers and you're going to come

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,959
along with us today at our day at the

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
you can already hear animals in the

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,440
distance. But we're celebrating 6

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,920
million subscribers with you guys today

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,840
at the safari park. There was I just saw

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,160
a shadow of like a big bird. Was there a

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,080
bird going by? All right. Well, we have

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
a whole day and night and the day again

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
of safariing ahead of us. So yeah, we're

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
spending the night at the zoo. That's

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,440
what like we're experiencing the roar

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
and snore. It's a legit zoo overnight.

79
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
We're going to roar today, snort

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
tonight, and roar tomorrow. Let's do it.

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
Matt, do you have anything to say to the

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
vlog before we get into the safari? I'm

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,040
just happy to have the time in my life.

84
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
Wow, that's good. Oh my god. Nick, how

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,360
do you feel? I just hope it lives up to

86
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
Matt's standards. I really do. I see

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,159
children walking over there. Let's go

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,319
say hi and see if they like the zoo. No,

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,680
let's not do that. Yeah, probably not

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,000
the best. Yeah, probably not. Good

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,159

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,159

questions that I didn't want to. We go

111
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,200
up to the lady at the front desk and I

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,280
go, she goes, "Oh, what brings you to

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,319
the zoo? Like, why are you and Nick just

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,799

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480

in this video. You did it numerous

121
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,760

And then just over by the elephants,

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,919
just don't use any um lights into the

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,080
habitat since they have really sensitive

138
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,120
eyes. Absolutely. Um ju just all around

142
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Oh, they're bringing the cart to us.

143

Never mind. I have hidden cheeits in

144
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,320

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
have to bring And I have Fruity Pebbles.

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, it's like dude, dinner's at like

147

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
We also aren't gonna feed the animals.

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
Like, what are we gonna do? We're not

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,960
gonna feed the animal. They're gonna You

152
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
catch me at 4:00 a.m. in the elephant

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,720
habitat with with a flashlight on. With

154
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
a flashlight on and Fruity Pebble. No,

155
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
it actually broke my heart. She said,

156
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,320
"Don't use your flashlight near the

157
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
elephant. They have sensitive eyes."

158
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
Well, isn't it crazy that like elephants

159
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,560
really like in the wild? They don't know

160
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,960
what like a flashlight is. Yeah, good

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
point. Let's go. Yeah. If you shine a

162
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
flashlight at it, it's probably like,

163
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
"What the heck?" Like, I think that that

164
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
with all animals, Chris, how do you

165
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,160
feel, Nick? Like a kid in a car seat.

166
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,680
Nice.

167
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Looks like you have like a shitty

168
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,800
diaper. That's what people compare these

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,800
things to all the time.

170
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm like, pull your hoop. Chris, stop

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,759
it. Okay, wonderful. Matt was just

172
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,400
referring to um back when we were in

173
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,199
high school, there was this guy name

174
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,280
and it and it wasn't tight enough and it

175
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,720
Oh my god. Yeah, really bad. Why did you

176
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,520
say that? I don't know. I exploded his

177
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
whole side cuz we don't ever say that.

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,600
So make sure your thing is tight. It is.

179
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,600
It will be

180
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,670
[Music]

181
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,840
[Music]

182
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,440
I'm so afraid actually. This is

183
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,759
insanity. Not the type of guy to say,

184
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,759
"Don't look down." No, I'm not, bro.

185
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,319
Look it. You can see right through it.

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,919
Look at me. He's going. I just We never

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,880
formally introduced Memo. He's just like

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,199
filming for us. Okay. Look at him. Oh my

189
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,840
god. He's a champ. He's This He loves

190
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,919
this [ __ ] I know. You love this [ __ ]

191
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
Stop. No. It's filming sharks if you

192
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120
could. No. If this is if this was

193
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
haunted, you'd like it more. Piece of

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
cake. Piece of cake. What have to break?

195
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,080
No, it's all automatic. It'll break for

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
you. It'll break for you. That's great

197
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,800
news. I didn't want to like have to like

198
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,800
pull a lever and twist around.

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,039
Imagine you just like you're getting to

200
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,039
the end. You're just increasing speed

201
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,039
faster and faster. Hold on to the black

202
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,960
straps while you land. And don't cross

203
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,639
your legs. She's tell I'm going to cross

204
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,840
my legs and hold on to the black straps.

205
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay, got it. No, you're supposed to

206
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,039
hold the straps. You go like this and

207
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,039
Yeah. go like this across my face.

208
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
Something about Nick like listening to

209
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
instructions and like not being able to

210
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,280
scream and yell at someone is so funny

211
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,599
to me. Look at him. You can take a seat.

212
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
It's the swaying back and forth after

213
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,840
you take the seat. That's the scariest

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
for me. Yeah. The loss of control. Mhm.

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,879
All right. Who wants to go first? Matt.

216
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,400
I'll go first. Sounds good. Two.

217
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,759
Wow.

218
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:13,840
Sorry for the hairline cam, y'all.

219
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,440
Ready? Yep. Three, two, later. Wow, you

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
guys. I have to be quiet cuz of the

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,000
rhinos. This is crazy being this high

222
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,879
up. Oh my god.

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,879
Oh my god.

224
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,879
Wow.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is a lot less scary than I thought

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,800
it would be. Dang.

227
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,479
Dude.

228
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,680
Oh my god. They look back at me. That

229
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,599
was the cutest thing I've ever seen in

230
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,320
my entire life. Dude, I'm freezing cold.

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,080
I look like I'm I'm like crying my eyes

232
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
out cuz of all the wind. This is like

233
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
insane,

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,279
guys. I'm not crying. It's just really

235
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,279
windy.

236
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:58,320
Oh my gosh. Oh, what's up?

237
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,800
Hi, sheep.

238
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,800
I'm flying.

239
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,920
Wow. This is going so fast. Imagine just

240
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,680
the top.

241
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,680
Listen to the landing c. Okay.

242
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,360
Wow.

243
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,880
My eyes are watering like so bad.

244
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,880
Oh, wow. That was nice. I don't think

245
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,200
I've ever needed a tissue more. That was

246
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,080
crazy. That was a beautiful ride. I

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,920
know. Very beautiful. You're in tears. I

248
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,000
know. I'm not in tears cuz of like how

249
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,880
emotional it was. It was just really

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
windy. Dude, the second my hood went I

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,760
was like, "Yeah, I can't do selfie

252
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
mode." This is a rough scene. No, it

253
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
looked like when I had my head out of

254
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,399
the [ __ ] sunroof of the

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,320
It's so cold. I think the left. This is

256
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
the left. That's the This is the right.

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
This is the left. Nick, why did that

258
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,200
fence to the right? This is to the left.

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
Are you serious? Now it's to the left,

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
but it's to the right over there. Is it

261
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
to the left? Am I losing my mind? To the

262
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
right.

263
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,160
We went this way. We went to the right.

264
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
They would stop us if we were going the

265
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
wrong way. We went to the left. We took

266
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,080
a lefthand turn. Look at where that

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
thing is and tell me what side of it

268
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,399
we're on. If you're facing this way, the

269
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
left

270
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,560
and snore. Wait. Yo, where's the

271
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,120
bathroom? Ask Joe. Joseph, is that is

272
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,040
that the bathroom? Ask. I don't know.

273
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,079
Like, why would we know? Why would we

274
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
know where the bathroom is? Oh,

275
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,680
restrooms. There we go. Good. All right.

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
There's a sign. Just that whole that

277
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
whole experience is like a reverse

278
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
catfish. like the internet. Am I seeing

279
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,279
an an elephant? That that zipline

280
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,200
experience was like reverse catfish.

281
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
Like it has Can you [ __ ] off? I started

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
this sentence six times and I've yet to

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,320
finish it. I'm just concerned cuz we

284
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,720
don't have like a zoo person with us.

285
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
We're at the camp that we paid to get.

286
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,839
We're going to be here all day. Yeah,

287
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,279
but don't we have like a safari to be

288
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,800
attending right now? I don't know. Let's

289
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,079
go to our find our stuff in one of these

290
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,279
camps. I have no idea. Oh my god. Space

291
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,560
camp. Oh, I get it. It's like I know

292
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,040
you're just super excited about that.

293
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,040
They're really annoying.

294
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,040
Is that a [ __ ] dinosaur? What is

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
this? I think it's a lion. It's just

296
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,079
someone in the bathroom taking a [ __ ]

297
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,200
Imagine. I don't think we were supposed

298
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,800
to walk away from that. I think we like

299
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
fully just broke the rules by leaving

300
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
the the front over there. Well, we were

301
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
supposed to go to the [ __ ] left. And

302
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
we went We took a left. It was Listen,

303
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,519
when we left, there was one of these.

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,160
See this fence? There was something just

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,079
like this. Like, no. Like we took the

306
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,440
only true path to glory. Like this was

307
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,200
the only way we could have gone. Yes.

308
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,279
But look what I'm saying is like see

309
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,399
that path right there. Yes. That's to

310
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,680
the right right now. Right. But if I was

311
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,839
here, it would be to the left. That's

312
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,320
what you're not getting. You took a left

313
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
and then went right.

314
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Was I supposed to just stand there like

315
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,200
this and wait for Joseph to the left?

316
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,880
Wait. We have time. What time is it? I

317
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,279
don't know. That little tour we took was

318
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,640
so so many facts. I feel I always feel

319
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,720
devastated hearing about how many

320
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,920
animals are extinct. But I also found

321
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,279
out that's the thing about the San Diego

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Zoo. They're working hard to bring them

323
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,240
back. Nonprofit organization.

324
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,600
They they make all their money and they

325
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
send it back to the animals. Yeah. Like

326
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,440
the in the large amount of money we

327
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,040
spent to do this whole thing on our own.

328
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
We just Let's think we just donated it

329
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
to them. We essentially just fed the

330
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
animals, which is such a nice

331
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,399
heartwarming feeling for me. You want to

332
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
know it's the the Are you serious now?

333
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,600
What is going on? He's hitting me with

334
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
this. You want to know what's the the

335
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,800
craziest thing that I learned while in

336
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,959
that step for safari? Tell us, Matt.

337
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,680
Endangered doesn't actually mean like

338
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,279
there's like none none left. No. Yes, it

339
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,399
it does. So endangered, listen,

340
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,920
endangered is like under 100. Extinct

341
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,519
means that you're out of here. No,

342
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,959
extinct doesn't necessarily mean you're

343
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
out of here. What I heard him say that

344
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,040
you're going to say is you can be

345
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
functionally extinct, which means

346
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,600
there's like all just like like two or

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
three female ones that can't like

348
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,279
they're extinct cuz when those ones that

349
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
are alive die, they're out of here.

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,880
Don't say die. That's a strong word. Say

351
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,120
like pass away. Yeah, there we go, dude.

352
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,320
And there's another animal which the

353
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,320
horse that was cloned. Yeah, that was

354
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,160
the first clone. They cloned a horse or

355
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,760
something. One thing that I blew my mind

356
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
was crazy that blew my I want Dude,

357
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
cloned a horse. Hold on. Wait, we're

358
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
going past that way too fast. They

359
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,839
claimed the horse. They clowned a horse.

360
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,519
He said that he said that it was the

361
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,760
same horse was alive in 2003.

362
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,519
It was me. I did it. I hope they're

363
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,680
working on the woolly mammoth, I think.

364
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,959
Okay. Undisclosed information. They're

365
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,320
working on the woolly mammoth. It's

366
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,839
unreleased. No, I think they're

367
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
unreleasing it. Okay. So, the bathroom,

368
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,880
it's in cryosleep right now or

369
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,519
something. This tent, this tent,

370
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,519
according to my map, is Oh, brother. is

371
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
tent number Oh, Joseph. I see him.

372
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,320
That's our guy. Get down there. That

373
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,430
one's 1038, by the way. Any questions

374
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,720
before we uh continue on?

375
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,639
[Music]

376
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,839
No questions. No questions. That was a

377
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,440
lot of fun. Excitement. When was the

378
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
last time you did the zipline? You know

379
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
what? I'm going to leave it to the

380
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
professionals

381
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,760
line.

382
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
It's kind of fun getting to go on the

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
zipline, see a little bit of that first.

384
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,000
This is the longest continuous zip line

385
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,480
in the continental US. Yeah. Over 2/3 of

386
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,560
a mile. And this is just like what three

387
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,399
habitats you're going over. Yeah. So,

388
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,760
uh, it just gives you a bit of scope on

389
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,040
on where exactly you are. I didn't even

390
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,839
realize I was on the zipline till I was

391
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,480
at the third habitat. It was so much at

392
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,440
first. Oh, here I am.

393
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,519
Great word. Habitat. I love that. Okay,

394
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,839
buddy. It's just a spell and define it.

395
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm not going to spell it. I thought you

396
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
were have to pay for this. Yeah, take a

397
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,720
look. I thought for sure I was like

398
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,160
going to need a quarter, but we caugh up

399
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,839
money. Wait, there's another one.

400
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh my god. Are you serious? You just let

401
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,040
go and hurt my hand. Up at the top of

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,120
the hill, we have a facility. You might

403
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,680
see the fences uh kind of put near the

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,600
trees. That's where the condor breeding

405
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,880
program beame uh began for the

406
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,440
California condors. Um in the 1980s,

407
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,519
there were 22 on the planet of the

408
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,920
California condors. Very Yeah, they are

409
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
they are scary, right? Very very cool.

410
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,360
So we call that the condor miniums

411
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,480
basically. Ah,

412
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,240
that's really been the main driver of

413
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
their

414
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
plan.

415
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,600
They what they talk about on the um on

416
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
the spotlight tour. We learned a lot

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
about your plant research and all that

418
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,160
type of stuff. Yes. How the plants are

419
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,720
worth more than Well, not not um

420
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,560
emotionally worth more, but like we love

421
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
the plants. We love the plants. We love

422
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,079
the animals equally. We don't have a

423
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,839
favorite child, but like if we're

424
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,639
talking money, the plants are making us

425
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,880
more. Yeah, exactly. So, if you think

426
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,560
about predators like lions, they're

427
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
mainly going to be able to see in a

428
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,120
grayscale from black to white, whereas

429
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,360
the colors red and green are opposite on

430
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,839
the color wheel. So, these mala, if they

431
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,320
can find a green grassy habitat, they're

432
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,639
not going to be seen. That's crazy. I

433
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,720
see them. Yeah. Right. And then if you

434
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,720
also look at their vertical stripe

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
pattern, that's going to break up their

436
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,880
body. Instead of looking like an

437
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,440
antelope, it's going to look like tall

438
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,519
grasses or bushes. Wow. Shout out

439
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
Evolution and Charles Darwin group.

440
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,399
That's our young female born in July.

441
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,399
Her name is Eminem. M&M. She's got two

442
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,160
younger uh brothers that are somewhere

443
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,519
in the habitat. Their names are Junior

444
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Mints and Big Red. Junior candy. Who the

445
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,279
name? You guys have a generator or you

446
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
guys name it? Yeah. What is the process?

447
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,759
Camouflage is such a crazy thing. Like

448
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
camouflage just blending in. Well, it's

449
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
also like just it's the fact that it's

450
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
camouflage because of how the lions see.

451
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,320
You know what I mean? Like we can see

452
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:38,399
those things clear as day. Lions cannot.

453
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,000
I think us being triplets. Oh my god. Hi

454
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,399
giraffes. Oh my god. Giraffes right

455
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,120
here. Mac goes rhino. You need to see

456
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,079
these guys. What's up y'all? Pewdiepie.

457
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh my. It looks a lot like the serial

458
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,079
six mil merch shirt is right here

459
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,000
actually. Hold on. Wait, this is great.

460
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,320
The camouflage is working cuz I only saw

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
that rhino. On the left there is a

462
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,759
rather special giraffe. Her name is

463
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,000
Satuni. This past week was her second

464
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,400
birthday. Let's go. Happy birthday.

465
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,199
Right. Happy birthday. And when she was

466
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,600
born, her ankles were too weak to stand.

467
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,959
Literally me kind of. So So what would

468
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,559
happen to a giraffe that couldn't stand

469
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,640
in the wild? It would die.

470
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,240
Unfortunately, it would be a hyena happy

471
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,400
meal, right? Unfortunately, they're not

472
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,079
going to be able to survive. Yeah.

473
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Luckily, here at the Safari Park, we

474
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,360
have something called the Harter

475
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,280
Veterinary Medical Center. We were able

476
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,679
to create custom leg braces for this

477
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,440
giraffe. I think we can agree she's very

478
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
fashionable. All right. They were

479
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,280
literally giraffe print, the braces.

480
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
Wow. I love that. And uh yeah, after 5

481
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,880
weeks of physical therapy, she was

482
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,880
deemed strong enough and and was sent

483
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
back to her family here. They are pretty

484
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,919
special. These birds are monogous. They

485
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,600
will mate for life every day. They will

486
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,240
sing to their partner to show that

487
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,400
they're still in love. How beautiful. We

488
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
need that nowadays. Yeah, we're lacking

489
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,520
that in the human species. Come on now.

490
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,000
Key to a long relationship is karaoke.

491
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,000
Amen. That's a big [ __ ] pond. Holy

492
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,480
[ __ ] Is that a male? This is a male.

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Way to go. And uh he's what we call a

494
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,200
Nile Lechwe. Uh leche is an African word

495
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,960
meaning antelope. So he's a Nile

496
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
antelope. He lives in Sudon along the

497
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,039
Nile. But you may have noticed he had

498
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,880
kind of like a tuxedo on. He's got that

499
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,400
little white bow tie on his neck. That's

500
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,080
how he gets matches on Zoo Harmony. Yes.

501
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,160
So the females are camouflaged.

502
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
Whereas the male stands out. So in the

503
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
female's mind, she's going to say, "Wait

504
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,880
a minute. A lion can see you when you're

505
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,600
still alive. That's really handsome."

506
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,520
So big and strong, Miss

507
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
Waffle.

508
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,559
are striped because they don't want to

509
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,559
be spotted, right?

510
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,720
That was a great joke. So, when there's

511
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,120
a big group of them together, a predator

512
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,880
might not be able to determine one from

513
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,799
another. It's so crazy that that's like

514
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
just their natural pattern. I feel like

515
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm getting vertigo. I know, right? The

516
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,799
fence, too. I'm like, what should happen

517
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,280
if you're a lion? Your eyes are going to

518
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,840
hurt after looking at these. Yeah. Oh my

519
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
god. They're definitely white with black

520
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,679
stripes. Like I don't know who started

521
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,880
that debate. Yeah, that one reminded me

522
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,240
of the um zebra print let's trip banner.

523
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,440
I was getting that I was getting that

524
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,679
vibe too. In terms of wildlife uh in

525
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,679
Africa, they are considered to be a very

526
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,360
protective animal.

527
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,320
They can even kill lions if they have

528
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,320
to. Damn. To keep their family safe. So

529
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,720
what they'll do is they'll form a

530
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,120
defensive front line. Bye zebras. Say

531
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,200
bye. Bye. Oh sorry. It's like our baby

532
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,440
Elliot here. He's not going to get the

533
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,840
dark coat until he's just waved at him.

534
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,000
Going into like giraffe puberty. How

535
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,880
tall is a baby giraffe? Like how tall is

536
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,280
Elliot? We stood next to Elliot. So at

537
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,200
birth, how how uh tall would you guess

538
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,559
that? 4 foot three. 43. You see that the

539
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
confidence there? Really? I don't know.

540
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,960
I took a guess, but I was like, I need

541
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,919
5T. I was I was going to say 4 foot. 4

542
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,960
foot. About 6 feet on average. Very

543
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,960
close. I'm 6'6. My height is a one-month

544
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,520
old giraffe. It's very humbling. Yes.

545
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,120
Right. True. That's important because

546
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,600
they've got to be the tallest animal in

547
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,360
the world one day, right? Uh the adults

548
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,120
stand 14 to 19 ft. Wow. And for every

549
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,559
foot of height, they have approximately

550
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,799
an inch of tongue. Damn. Wow. Inch per

551
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,039
tongue per height or whatever. Crazy.

552
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,039
What crazy ratio. Yeah.

553
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,039
hour.

554
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,760
I yawned. Nick, when you're editing,

555
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,760
when I yawn, it's probably like a

556
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Okay,

557
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,159
quick brief announcement. Um, our tour

558
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
guide, Joseph, was shining red lights

559
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,679
like right in the animal's eyes. And it

560
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,240
probably looks like kind of like

561
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,919
annoying to the animals, but fun fact,

562
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
Joseph told us that the red light

563
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,760
doesn't bother the animals because it's

564
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,520
the way the animals see. Like all the

565
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,880
animals he was shining the light right

566
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
in their eye, they don't see the red

567
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,520
light, so it doesn't bother them at all.

568
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,240
The only animals that you can't shine

569
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,240
red lights at are birds and elephants

570
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,000
because elephants eyes are sensitive to

571
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,000
light and birds can see ultraviolet.

572
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,919
That's what it was.

573
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Birds can see ultraviolet light. I don't

574
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,360
even know what that means. It's UV.

575
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,280
You've heard of UV before? I think we

576
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
can see that, too. We saw the red light.

577
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,159
I don't know. Something about those

578
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,720
animals don't see. They can see

579
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,559
ultraviolet. We saw the red. We saw we

580
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,679
saw the red light. I know that. Like, do

581
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,000
we have not the same vision? Sorry. The

582
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,679
red light isn't ultraviolet light. Okay,

583
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
whatever. Everything has ultraviolet

584
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,280
light. The sun is producing ultraviolet

585
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,039
light. So, shock that the birds are can

586
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,400
able to see it. Whatever. It doesn't

587
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,320
matter. Anyway, this is just a

588
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
disclaimer that Joseph wasn't being rude

589
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,520
and blinding the animals. They just

590
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,760
couldn't see the red light. True. We

591
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,200
have a ran antelope male. We actually

592
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,600
have several of them. Hello. I I'll I'll

593
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
pause here if you do want to stand um on

594
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,919
the cart. But you can see they've got

595
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,600
this interesting facial pattern, right?

596
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,039
They knew we had special guests today.

597
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,200
They put their makeup on. Yes. Glam and

598
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,120
the uh the black line that covers their

599
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
eye extends the appearance of their

600
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,320
horns so they look scarier, more

601
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,919
formidable to predators. Wow. So makeup

602
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,840
is their protection. These are all boys.

603
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,360
So these are the drag queens of Africa.

604
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,679
Yes. And uh very very useful. In fact,

605
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,760
the nickname is the lion king. If you

606
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,400
can see the exposed rock face in the

607
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,840
distance, that is our habitat for our

608
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,159
male big horn sheep. So, you can see our

609
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,320
big horn literally have the entire side

610
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,640
of a mountain up. Yeah, that's crazy.

611
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,960
And they love it because they're great

612
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
rock climbers, right? So, if you put

613
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,039
your hands together and squeeze really

614
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,200
tightly, there's almost like a suction

615
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,880
that occurs. Yes, I do it for fun

616
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,799
sometimes. Right. And that's because

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,919
they have a hard outer bony shell and a

618
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,159
squishy soft inside. Um, and that that

619
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,720
really does act like a suction cup to uh

620
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,960
stay on the rocks, right? Help them away

621
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,960
from predators.

622
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,480
That's crazy. We can hear lions. Lions

623
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,400
are dying. Not that they happen, but

624
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,039
what's the protocol if a lion escapes?

625
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
You pray really hard.

626
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,080
No, there's a lot of security measures

627
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,679
in place here. Oh, it's cuddling

628
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,720
together.

629
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,520
That is so crazy. See, right in front of

630
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,840
my eyes. I thought it was a statue.

631
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,200
Laying on her back. Gigantic. So

632
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
gigantic. These are one of the most

633
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
powerful animals in the world. And they

634
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,200
kind of just looked like our house cat

635
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,600
scaled up. Yeah. Wow. This dude is this

636
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
lady, sorry, is looking right into my

637
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,400
soul. I know. She definitely is. She

638
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,919
definitely knows you're here. Uh, as I

639
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,480
mentioned, there are three sisters about

640
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,120
10 years old. Their names are Zuri,

641
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,200
Malikica, and Amira. Shout out this

642
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,799
piece of glass. For real. I know. Shout

643
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
out to the glass. Shout out to the

644
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,000
glass. Doing everything I needed to do.

645
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,159
I would be Zur's lunch.

646
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,200
How you doing? Welcome.

647
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,559
How are you? We got you guys in ready.

648
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
I'll take really great care of you and

649
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,240
I'll come back to get you in one.

650
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,440
Awesome. Thank you. Can I run to the

651
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,440
bathroom quickly? Here's the reconc

652
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,679
Hello. Hi. Ooh. Wow. This looks really

653
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,240
good. There's ribs, wings, mac and

654
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,600
cheese, baked beans, klelaw, salad, and

655
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,279
roll. Awesome. Thank you so much. This

656
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,799
entire Roar and Snore experience, this

657
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
is the craziest part for me so far. We

658
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,440
have this full restaurant to oursel,

659
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,760
which is insane. I'm about to eat some

660
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,520
ribs. I'm about to get some What did she

661
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,080
say? This was mac and cheese. Mac and

662
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,200
cheese sandwich. Oh,

663
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,559
Nick and Matt need to get out of the

664
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,880
bathroom, bro. They're missing out. I'm

665
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,640
about to steal all our food. Nick just

666
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
told me that there was a lion in the

667
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,799
bathroom and I had like a mini jumped

668
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,559
back and then he turned the lights on.

669
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,400
He was like looking with his flashlight.

670
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,559
Matt, he was looking for a minute and 30

671
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
seconds. I go, Matt, there's no lion.

672
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,760
Like I jokingly told him and he started.

673
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,520
I know. How crazy is it that we just

674
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,279
have this whole restaurant? Like I know,

675
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,679
dude. Usually there's like probably 40

676
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,440
people, 30 people. This is our first

677
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,480
time using our big boy YouTube money to

678
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
like do something about that. This is

679
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,080
the first time we've like balled out in

680
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,679
our YouTube curb. This and buying dad a

681
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,000
truck. Yeah. So, make sure you guys

682
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,320
watch this [ __ ] video, please. I feel

683
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,240
bad looking at animals all day and then

684
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
eating them. You're not eating them.

685
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,320
You're eating like I don't care. I'm

686
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,039
starving. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I got

687
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,279
to eat. She said there's hot chocolate,

688
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
coffee, like tea, and then if we want

689
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,640
soda, we can just ask one of them and

690
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,520
they'll get us a soda. Wow. What a

691
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,440
[ __ ] fruitful experience.

692
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,799
Fruitful experience. It's so unfortunate

693
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,440
that there's nobody else here cuz these

694
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,720
it's like just private and us three and

696
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,159
memo get to experience all this but I

697
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,799
feel like such a douchebag. You know

698
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,799
what I mean? But it's for like us. I

699
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,919
feel great. This is like they should

700
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,600
have made all this. I know. It's just

701
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,760
It's okay. We'll be fine. I'll eat as

702
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,400
much as I possibly can. What is this?

703
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,000
This is so fun. Oh my god. Hey, we're at

704
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
the [ __ ] zoo at night in the middle

705
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,559
of the night. That's That's always been

706
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,840
my biggest fear. I walk around the zoo

707
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,919
during the day and like imagine being

708
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,279
here at night and now it's in front of

709
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
right here. Well, it is cool just to be

710
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,799
private and like Guys, this is We have

711
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,960
to just be super thankful. Do we have

712
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,720
cash we can like give like some people?

713
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
I got nothing. Yeah, I know. I got a

714
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,039
hungry belly. That's all I got. Dude, I

715
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,080
love that memo. Oh, the fire crackling.

716
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:35,640
Snap crack snapple pop. I thought B was

717
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,640
coming to get me.

718
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,360
You definitely see the camera full

719
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,159
shake. I was so nervous. Yeah. No, I

720
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,080
thought you How are you enjoying? Give

721
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,200
me a second place. Dude, I asked you a

722
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,919
question. You didn't answer. Chris,

723
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,480
favorite animal you saw so far. Did I

724
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,000
see a deer? Yeah.

725
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,520
What? What was that called? I know it's

726
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
like annoying to say cuz it just

727
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,480
happened, but I think that those lions

728
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,120
were like a top tier experience. That

729
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,200
was crazy. They were right there.

730
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
I hate eating ribs on camera. I'm just

731
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,679
like sloppy right now. I love this font.

732
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,679
Oh my god. Matt, where do you recognize

733
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,120
this coffee font from? Um cuz it kind of

734
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,320
looks familiar to me. I can't really

735
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,720
tell like where it's from. It looks like

736
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,520
um What the [ __ ] Guys, if you know what

737
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,200
this is from, please let me know. Oh

738
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,520
yeah, that's right. It's the Still

739
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,120
Triplet 6 Million shirt. Nick, doesn't

740
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,799
that font look familiar? It looks so

741
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,559
familiar. It looks exactly the 6 million

742
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,640
Stella Triplet shirt. I feel like the

743
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,480
www.sernalclo.com

744
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,000
that's available right now on the triple

745
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,919
website. Every single one of these

746
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
tables and every single one of the tents

747
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,840
that you saw earlier is supposed to have

748
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,279
somebody in it. But we bought

749
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,279
everything. So look at all the empty

750
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,279
tables.

751
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Just us and Memo so he can vlog and the

752
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,960
zookeepers. Yeah, the keepers of the

753
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,240
zoo. No, I can't believe like I'm super

754
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,240
respectful that the Lions are over

755
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,240
there, but I can picture like other

756
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,240
teams.

757
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
Yeah. Like shining the flashlight. Also,

758
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,679
we're so we're fully unsupervised and

759
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,279
there's an African elephant right there.

760
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,000
Right there. Like we could do just about

761
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,600
anything, dude. That's unbelievable.

762
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I've never had this much easy access to

763
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,360
an African elephant ever before in my

764
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,520
life. I know. I could go outside and

765
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,520
ride the Fortnite emote on a for on an

766
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,720
elephant. They're right there. I could

767
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,240
probably hit him with this cup.

768
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
Literally, I'm not going to, but I

769
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,520
definitely could. It's just crazy that

770
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,880
we're here and this is what we're doing.

771
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,480
But also, we've done so much today

772
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,480
already. We still have a night vision

773
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,320
safari tonight, which I don't know how I

774
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,640
don't know how we're going to vlog. A

775
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,760
night vision safari. And then we have

776
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,000
tomorrow morning where we're going to

777
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,919
meet an animal. So, yep. Guys, where

778
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,240
we're going right now is our little

779
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,840
night trip. And we entered this room and

780
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,919
we were told we were going to see bats.

781
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,440
So, I decided to pretend that the bats

782
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
were going to attack us the moment we

783
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,039
walked into this room. our camera like

784
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,799
really really sucks in the dark cuz we

785
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,240
didn't have a light and we're also not

786
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,880
allowed to shine the light at the

787
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,039
animals like we just said previously. So

788
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,120
when we walked in it was like those like

789
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,960
double doors that like they have at like

790
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,120
um what's it called? Petting zoos.

791
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
That's it. It's like those double doors

792
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,559
that they have at petting zoos but for

793
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,760
like the bat for the birds to stay

794
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,159
the bats. Listen to these goddamn bats.

795
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,360
Listen to these goddamn bats. That's all

796
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
I have to say.

797
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Oh wow, it's hot. I'll open up the next

798
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:30,799
door once this one can close.

799
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,360
So nice to get warm for a second.

800
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,360
Release the bats.

801
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,799
Nick, this is totally up your alley.

802
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,360
Bats are like my favorite animal. We did

803
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,880
we did a tour and we like competed

804
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,600
against each other and each picked an

805
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,039
animal and Nick the bats

806
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,880
on specific animal. Did you see him

807
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:03,440
spread his wings? No, I was blinking. He

808
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,279
looked like [ __ ] Robert Patson in

809
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,799
there. Okay, let me go. Oscar. Yes,

810
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,840
Oscar from Fortnite. You have to get his

811
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:17,559
frenzy auto brother. Oh, hello. Here is

812
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,559
big brother. This is I believe our male

813
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,640
rail. Yeah, he looks like a statue. And

814
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,039
if we kept walking, we wouldn't even

815
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,679
know me. He's just like the Fortnite

816
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,600
skin. He does. Fortnite.

817
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,360
It's crazy how like tigers are like the

818
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,960
most intimidating looking animal in my

819
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,399
opinion. Really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like

820
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,399
this dude looks like he's just going to

821
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,720
attack. Yeah. Especially because look at

822
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
his face. His head looks so much bigger

823
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,480
because of that. It's kind of like a

824
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,799
beard. It's a facial rough. He has all

825
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,200
around his head in a big circle. He

826
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,600
looks a lot more formidable. So he if he

827
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,159
encounters another tiger, he's gonna

828
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,159
look more powerful. Earlier I was

829
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,600
mentioning their feet, right? They have

830
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,840
suction cup feet. That's going to enable

831
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,559
them to go up these incredible steep

832
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,480
rocky uh cliffs like literally nothing.

833
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,159
I can't even walk in a straight line. I

834
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,000
know.

835
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,320
That's insanity. These are all females

836
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,279
that we hope are pregnant right now. Uh

837
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,880
our male Diablo got to come out here and

838
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:19,640
um she looked it up. Diablo.

839
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,640
Hello. Diablo came out here and

840
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,600
never mind. He was a great

841
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,000
conservationist, one would say. Yes, he

842
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,200
helped a lot. He helped a lot to save

843
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,440
his species. He had a great time.

844
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,600
But here's actually what the male horns

845
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,960
look like through the years. That's

846
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,679
crazy. So, you can see as just a young

847
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,559
animal all the way up to a fully grown

848
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,320
ram at about 10 years old. It's a word.

849
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,120
Do you want to explain the rarity of a

850
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,240
platypusy?

851
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,760
You mean a platypus? I can explain the I

852
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,840
meant to say platypus. I didn't even

853
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,159
mean to be funny there. That just funny.

854
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,360
No, cuz you said it so casually. Do you

855
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,159
want to explain the meaning of a

856
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,640
platypusy? This is [ __ ] crazy. This

857
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,039
is the craziest fact I've ever learned

858
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,679
in my entire life. There's only two

859
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,159
platypus in this entire world that are

860
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,320
not in Australia. And they were both in

861
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,480
that [ __ ] enclosure at the San Diego

862
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,240
Safari Park. And we met them. No, we met

863
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,440
one of them. We met them. What was his

864
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,200
name? I don't know. Julius. No, that was

865
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,200
a snake. That was the snake. Julius.

866
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,720
Julius Squeezer.

867
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,600
That was the snake. Cuz he's a Cuz he

868
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,919
he's a constrictor snake. Squeezer. Get

869
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,320
it? Oh my god. What are you doing? I

870
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,880
think of Harry the Platypus from Every

871
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,880
Time, right? Me too. Frozen. Yeah.

872
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Superb.

[Music]

874
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,919
I have grown. I think platypus might be

875
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,150
in my top three favorite animal. I'm not

876
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:03,660
so cute.

so much.

882
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,679
S'more time. S'mor time. What was that?

883
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,880
Popcorn. Popcorn.

884
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,919
Something about me is I'm the best

885
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,840
s'more cooker around. Just saying. I

886
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,519
take pride in my s'mores. I used to grow

887
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,320
up in Cape Cod making s'mores.

888
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,399
Vermont, Maine.

889
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,279
Such a New England activity to roast a

890
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,720
s'more with your friends. I'm not even

891
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,559
close to the fire. Hands are nice and

892
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,600
cool. The most mids'more maker I've ever

893
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,660
seen in my [ __ ] life. Golden brown

894
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
delighteness.

895
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,320
[Music]

896
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,720
Nick, are you serious? Stop squeezing

897
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,720
it. When we were like 11 years old, Nick

898
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,960
hit Matt with a flaming marshmallow and

899
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,720
it stuck to his face and he had to go to

900
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,039
the doctor. That's crazy. Fun fact.

901
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm feeling literally amazing. This is

902
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,599
like a dream to me. Mhm. Like actually,

903
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm going to drop a bag on my honeymoon.

904
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,280
It just be me and my wife looking at the

905
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,879
zoo animals. Okay, so one of the things

906
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,800
that we did while we were at the safari

907
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,040
park, but we didn't vlog was the night

908
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,000
vision safari only because we don't have

909
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,639
a night vision camera. Yeah, obviously.

910
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,119
Which I do have. I just didn't bring.

911
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,560
It's in my room. Rats. Rats. Should have

912
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,159
brought it. Anyways, we're going to sing

913
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,679
you a little song while we insert photos

914
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,040
from our night vision. I'm not singing

915
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,720
anything. I'm not singing anything. All

916
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,919
right, we'll insert music. But here are

917
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,919
some photos from our night vision

918
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,919
experience.

919
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,320
Reveal yourself.

920
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,599
Guys, this is like the scariest bathroom

921
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,040
walk ever. Get down to it. Get down to

922
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,200
it. The lighting is kind of mid. I bet

923
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,960
you the tap water here kind of gross.

924
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
Like it's probably like mongoose

925
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,440
infested. You don't even know what a

926
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,119
mongoose is.

927
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,640
I'm going to stand here and watch guards

928
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,880
that we're not all [ __ ] at the same

929
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,839
time. Dude, brushing your teeth at the

930
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,520
zoo is a very difficult. It's not even

931
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,680
difficult. It's just like, how do I spin

932
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,000
this? Triple tap the right side.

933
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,480
Whoa.

934
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,280
I never I never thought I'd do this in

935
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,839
my life. Good morning, campers. This is

936
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,880
your wakeup call.

937
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,040
Breakfast is served at 7 a.m. Please

938
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,960
have your personal items packed up. You

939
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,560
can leave those items right inside your

940
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,560
tent door as to avoid them getting wet.

941
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,320
Good morning world. Good morning

942
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,440
friends. We're going to get ready for

943
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,200
today. Yeah, we just got wake up call at

944
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,920
the zoo. Literally, we woke up. She's

945
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,119
like, "Good morning." Me starting a

946
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,720
podcast. She said, "Good morning,

947
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,400
campers." And I instantly thought I was

948
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,960
on camera. No, legit. I was like,

949
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,119
"Hello, podcast."

950
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,400
Hi. Good morning, campers.

951
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,160
We unzipped this. We could see an

952
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
elephant. Don't unzip it. I need to

953
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,160
change my underwear. Okay, I'll zip it

954
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,800
back up. Dramatic [ __ ] Move out of my

955
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,400
way. Oh my goodness. Get out of the way,

956
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,440
man. The animals at the zoo are

957
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,160
experiencing aggression this morning. No

958
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,040
elephants. It was

959
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,520
no elephants. No elephants. I fell

960
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
asleep pretty early. No, it took me a

961
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,599
while. I lied. They gave us these

962
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,480
bracelets yesterday.

963
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
Oh my god. Found out today. I can't

964
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,680
sleep with them. It's like one of those

965
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,920
sensory things. I was like rubbing my

966
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,119
arm. I I ripped it off in the middle of

967
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,800
the night. I was like I was freeing

968
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,400
myself from shackles. I ripped it off my

969
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,320
body. I said, "Free me." I think the

970
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,520
first thing we do today is like get real

971
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,880
up close with an animal. Let's find out.

972
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,119
Well, Nick, how do you lose your

973
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,200
toothbrush the bathroom toothbrush?

974
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,320
Asking how do you lose [ __ ] If everyone

975
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,079
knew how they lost [ __ ] do you want to

976
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,400
know what happened in this world? No one

977
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,920
would lose [ __ ] Thank you, Matt. Well,

978
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,520
it's just like too frequently that

979
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,320
you're losing stuff. I think

980
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,280
this kid's using a [ __ ]

981
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,880
finger to brush his teeth. How gross.

982
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,160
People are going to blame me for that.

983
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,200
Sure not, Nick. You got to do what you

984
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,359
got to do. And you're glamping.

985
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,359
Yes.

986
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,359
Yes.

987
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,040
I woke up like this. Wait, where'd you

988
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,640
get that cool shirt, Nick? Still.com.

989
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,480
No. Um,.com.

990
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,800
Whoa.

991
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,880
It makes you really look cool in your

992
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,079
outfit fully. I woke up like this.

993
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,760
Flawless. I woke up like this. Flawless.

994
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,119
Okay, dude. I woke up. All right. All

995
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,400
right. You're freaking everyone. You

996
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
keep making me think that there's

997
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,160
someone that I'm recording you. Well,

998
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,000
cuz you're saying, "All right. All

999
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
right." Like as if like there's a crowd.

1000
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,359
Well, it's just like, "All right, settle

1001
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,440
down. Let me take you out. Go." I can't

1002
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,280
believe we woke up at the [ __ ] zoo. I

1003
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,640
thought I was in the psych ward. Like I

1004
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,680
woke up and I'm like, "No way. I'm

1005
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,280
actually with animals in the zoo today."

1006
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,960
I thought this was a dream. What are we

1007
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,400
hoping that's on the breakfast menu

1008
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,119
here? Um I'll just be happy to see bacon

1009
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,240
and apple juice. Honestly, I could use a

1010
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,160
cup of OJ right now. Big time. There's

1011
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,400
not much sugar left. Chris had the whole

1012
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,640
[ __ ] cane yesterday during breakfast.

1013
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,520
During dinner,

1014
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,240
drank every last bit of iced tea and

1015
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,320
used every [ __ ] sugar pal. Nick, try

1016
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,680
those.

1017
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,160
I don't know. I don't know. But this

1018
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,839
bacon looks good as [ __ ] Get that

1019
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,760
bacon, buddy. All right.

1020
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,520
How many days out of a week, Nick, do

1021
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,680
you think you could survive out here? 10

1022
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,680
million. I could live the rest of my

1023
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,040
life here. I guarantee myself. This

1024
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:09,440
isn't like crazy conditions. It's

1025
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,760
breakfast. Cold. I'm just cold. No, I am

1026
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,359
genuinely like

1027
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,680
I I wish I could spend the rest of my

1028
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,160
life here. Would you guys not even grab

1029
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,240
breakfast? Breakfast with a with a view.

1030
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,760
What do you mean? I got some potatoes. I

1031
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,480
got this. I'm going to try that [ __ ]

1032
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,800
little fritter. I'm going to I'm going

1033
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,280
to go for everything. It's I'm going to

1034
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,480
have to do a rewalk up for sure. I just

1035
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,359
can't believe we are where we are. Look

1036
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,839
it. Wow. Look out there.

1037
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,760
It's just unbelievable. Is it crazy? And

1038
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,359
here we are. This is perfect. Good

1039
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,440
morning, world. I'm going to skate the

1040
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,160
safari today. I think this will be the

1041
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,160
best view I have eating breakfast for at

1042
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,040
least the next 8 months. Yeah. Unless

1043
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,720
Nick wakes up, gets all Nick wakes up

1044
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,839

1045
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,480

1046
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,079
officiator. No [ __ ] can't. No, he

1047
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,359
can't. How is he going to say what he

1048
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,320
needs to say? No, he can't. No, he

1049
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,440
can't. has the No, he doesn't. No, he

1050
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,359

1051
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,240
impression, that dude. Get He's in the

1052
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,400
trunk, too. Uh-huh. How's your coffee?

1053
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,960
Didn't try it yet. Sugarless cuz of this

1054
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,160
idiot. Sugar, dude. He was dumping like

1055
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,839
sugar packets in the thing. I was like,

1056
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,920
"You need to go to bed tonight." Yeah, I

1057
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,599
took a sweet tea to my room, but went

1058
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,440
crazy. Go to bed, dude. It's like 2:00

1059
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,680
a.m. We're all getting in bed and he's

1060
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,880
like, "Dump. You're sugar wrestling in

1061
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,640
the corner of the room." Like, what are

1062
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,640
you doing over there? It's like a kid on

1063
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Christmas snooping in their kiss.

1064
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,660
[Laughter]

1065
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,599
Thank you.

1066
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,680
Nice. You're not real. Breakfast. What

1067
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,880
was that? Two Advil in a Yeah. I don't

1068
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,880
even have a headache yet. I just know

1069
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,880
that's coming. Yeah. I have a headache

1070
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,839
every morning.

1071
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,920
Elephant be your neck up there. Up here.

1072
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,599
Oh, Chris always says that a fun fact

1073
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,680
that he loves, but I don't even know if

1074
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,599
he's right or not, but he likes that

1075
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,680
what is it? Baby elephants like can't

1076
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,160
control their trunk. That is true. It

1077
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,480
takes them 5 years to figure it out. Oh

1078
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,800
my god. So, our friends just figured it

1079
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,319
out. Yeah, they just figured it out.

1080
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,920
That's crazy. Yeah, Chris always like

1081
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,520
he'll randomly tell me that. I'm like I

1082
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,040
don't know how true that is, but that is

1083
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,960
very true. Very true. Wow. So, wherever

1084
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,119
he got your information, it's accurate.

1085
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,200
Amazing. Good to know. Now I can say it

1086
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,920
fully and yeah, proudly. I like tell

1087
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,640
people that all the time. How big is a

1088
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,400
baby elephant born? So, they're usually

1089
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,359
born between 200 and 250 lbs. Wow. Uh,

1090
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,640
their moms are pregnant for about 22

1091
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,079
months. Wa. 20 to 22 months is the

1092
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,800
average. So, they're pregnant for almost

1093
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,400
2 years. That's crazy. I I just started

1094
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,359
saying I'm two right when I'm born. If I

1095
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,040
was like, I'm two. That's so long.

1096
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,880
You're My god, Nick, you are two baby

1097
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,480
elephants. Two of you is one baby

1098
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,560
elephant. Isn't that crazy? What do you

1099
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,520
mean? They're 300 lb or or 200 300. Was

1100
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,359
that true? At birth. Yeah. Was an extra

1101
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,960
big baby. She was born at 281 lb. The

1102
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,160
largest calf ever born here at the

1103
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,680
Safari Park. Wow. Damn.

1104
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,280
That's crazy. She was born early, too.

1105
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,520
Yeah. It's literally you twice is how

1106
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,800
big shows. I'll say like two and a two

1107
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,240
and a third. Two and a half. Maybe.

1108
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,119
Yeah, I will. I'll give you some wiggle

1109
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,480
room. Just maybe. Yeah. Never. I'd never

1110
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,760
want to think about my weight being that

1111
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,319
close to an elephant ever again. Baby,

1112
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,319
baby, baby, baby.

1113
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,800
They don't even know they're drunk yet.

1114
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,680
Both around 4,000 lb. Oh my god. I'm not

1115
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,079
there.

1116
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,319
Hello.

1117
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,240
She must be sick of us. I just saw us

1118
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,960
all yesterday. Oh, there's the third.

1119
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,280
Hello. Big yawn.

1120
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,520
Big yawn. Good morning. Oh my goodness.

1121
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,560
That's insane.

1122
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,760
Just the sheer strength of a lion scares

1123
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,839
me to think about. Like, oh my god.

1124
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,200
Looking at the view. That was crazy. And

1125
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,720
she was right here. I was like, "Hello.

1126
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,680
I hope this glass is strong so you don't

1127
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,880
eat and kill me." Did you see the marks

1128
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,280
on the glass? Oh. Uh, yeah. Like the Oh

1129
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,599
my god. Yeah,

1130
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,880
I'm good. Wear and tear, baby. One day

1131
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,960
that thing's going to bust open. Hello,

1132
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,720
Nick. Nick, what are you pushing?

1133
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,720
Pressure testing. Pressure. Hey, like,

1134
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,520
let's not do this [ __ ] It's inch

1135
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,640
thick acrylic. So, wow. See, Chris,

1136
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,400
yeah, this isn't going to do anything.

1137
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,680
They're [ __ ] Don't disturb them is

1138
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
what I'm saying. You don't tap a fish

1139
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,560
tank. You know what I mean? I didn't tap

1140
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,560
it. I was like, "All right. All right.

1141
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,160
Stop leaning on it." That was a lion.

1142
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,760
The last thing I'd want is you banging

1143
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,800
on my glass. Shh. I didn't bang on it.

1144
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,680
Didn't bang on it. Hearing the smell of

1145
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,440
the predators over Eurasian eagle owl.

1146
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,760
Eurasian eagle owls are found in Europe,

1147
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,960
Asia. Females are larger. It makes a lot

1148
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,560
of sense. Think about they're the ones

1149
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,359
that lay the eggs. They're the ones that

1150
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,359
stay at the nest site. Things like that.

1151
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,200
You all are very strong guys. Well, we

1152
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,119
used to all work at a grocery store and

1153
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,040
when you said I just think of like a

1154
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,480
quarter pound of cheese and I like used

1155
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,440
to like hold that and I'd be like,

1156
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,359
"Wow." Like that. It's heavy. Like 12

1157
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,960
times is how much the owl is crazy. Go

1158
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,319
dig.

1159
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,160
So, she's going to do what's called a

1160
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,560
digging behavior. She's got to find

1161
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,640
those meal worms. Exactly what we want

1162
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,800
her to do. And that's a natural behavior

1163
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,079
for baby foxes. They will dig dig dig

1164
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,400
dig dig. And they're inseexctovores

1165
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,960
somewhat. They're also carnivores as

1166
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,040
well, too. But in comparison to other

1167
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,680
canids, they actually have an extra set

1168
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,400
of mers in their mouth, giving them the

1169
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,920
ability to really break down those

1170
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,839
exoskeletons

1171
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,640
because when mama fox goes back to the

1172
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,480
den and has to regurgitate all that

1173
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:06,160
yummy food to those um kits, you know,

1174
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,319
the the baby foxes, they need nutrients.

1175
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,960
So, African porcupine. You guys ever

1176
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,960
seen a North America?

1177
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,960
Yeah, this is crazy.

1178
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:23,520
Super huge, right? Uhhuh. Oh my god. So,

1179
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,319
one of the things about Harley is that

1180
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,520
you'll notice that she has very small

1181
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:32,880
eyes. She's got There you go. There you

1182
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,680
go. She has very small Oh, like um they

1183
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,079
look like rodents. Rodents. Exactly. So

1184
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,599
the rodents, this is the rodent family.

1185
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,280
You ever taken any of those signs and

1186
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,920
the quills are sharp and the black and

1187
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,359
white is a signal is a myth. They cannot

1188
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,480
physically shoot quills out of their

1189
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,160
body. It would be like me shooting

1190
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,599
eyebrows out of my head. You know what I

1191
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,400
mean? It's just not physically possible

1192
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,760
for them. But it'll come out like if you

1193
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,760
get your sunglasses stuck in your hair

1194
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,319
and you pull your sungl out of your head

1195
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,319
in that capacity. Well, if my hand goes

1196
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,960
here, the quil sticks in my hand and I

1197
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,400
go out, then you've got an infection.

1198
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,599
It's like a splinter. If you leave it in

1199
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,200
there too long and it's a real dirty

1200
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,920
splinter, you're going to get like Zuri

1201
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:14,160
is this cat's name. Means beautiful in

1202
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,000
Swahili. Um right now Zuri is going to

1203
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,680
do some fishing right now incredibly

1204
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,200
well. She's under great medical care

1205
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,560
here at this Flashstone.

1206
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,480
Um it's warm water at least. Um but we

1207
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,359
actually do blood pressure with her now.

1208
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,160
10 to 15 years, but you can tell she's

1209
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,400
still moving around incredibly well.

1210
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,119
Unlike a cheetah, cheetahs have spots

1211
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,839
only. She has spots and stripes. So

1212
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,040
those spots and stripes make them really

1213
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:45,760
unique in that capacity.

1214
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,839
He is huge. So Aaron came over to help

1215
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,160
as well too. People think it's Oh, this

1216
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,920
is a great pet. Yeah. They bring in

1217
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,440
their home and then it gets this big and

1218
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
they don't have the space for it. He

1219
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,800
sticks it out, senses the environment,

1220
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,160
brings it back into that Jacobson's

1221
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,319
organ, which are those two pits in the

1222
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,000
roof of his mouth, and it allows him to

1223
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,400
decide, do I need to go left? Do I need

1224
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,079

you sound like the owl at the end. Oh

1329
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:50,359
no, the owl. That's that's what the owl

1330
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,359
like. Remember the owl?

1331
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,400
That's a chicken. That's a chicken.

1332
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,240
Yeah, that's chicken. What you had

before?

1334
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,920
What animal did you see that you just

1335
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,839
wanted to become that moment? Oh god.

1336
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,680
Like I wanted to just be a tiger. The

1337
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,160
second I saw him lurking. I was like,

1338
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,440
"Oh my god, I'd do anything." What about

1339
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,839
you? Um, I was good. I didn't want to

1340
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,760
be. Yeah, I was done. You didn't feel

1341
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,520
that once? No, not once did I feel like

1342
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,480
I wanted to be one of these animals.

1343
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,400
What about like

1344
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,920
how about the turtle named Flapjack? And

1345
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,280
he's a pancake turtle. What? The

1346
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,400
pancake. Oh, I forgot about that idiot.

1347
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,359
Flapjack. He was so dumb.

1348
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,119
Flapjack. It was so pancake turtle. He

1349
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:33,119
was cute though. Like call me human

1350
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,559
then. You know what? What are you

1351
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,480
talking about? Like I don't know. It's

1352
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,000
just a lame name. It's not creative.

1353
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,359
Thank you guys so much for 6 million

1354
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,200

again for 6 million subscribers. We had

1359
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,800
so much fun filming that video. If you

1360
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,800
like videos like this, we want to start

1361
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,119
doing more elaborate videos, but

1362
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,240
obviously it made us miss the Wednesday.

1363
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,040
So let us know what you think about

1364
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,960
that. That little combo crossover video.

1365
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,880
We might also just start doing car

1366
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,559
videos on Fridays. Whatever. We'll

1367
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,400
figure out a schedule. Who knows what

1368
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,240
the but we're just having fun right now.

1369
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,480
That's it. That's that's that's the goal

1370
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,680
in it all, isn't it? Day and that's what

1371
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,160
you guys should be doing as well. Go

1372
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,720
have fun. And also, while you're having

1373
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,040
fun, go also shop for Sternolo Clothing

1374
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,400

6 million subscribers, we're on the road

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,960
to 7 million people. All of our 6

1378
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
million merch is now available right

1379
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,520
now. Six mill merch is never coming back

1380
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,839
again after it's sold out. Fair to say

1381
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,680
it is gone forever once it's gone. Also,

1382
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,319
we're going to put a signed postcard by

1383
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,280
all three triplets in each order for

1384
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,040
every single 6 mill purchase. My hand is

1385
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,880
hurting. This is what Matt is signing

1386
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,280
basically. Yeah, we've been signing a

1387
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,280
ton of cards nontop. Everyone say

1388
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,559
something really awkward to the camera.

1389
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,640
Like, you're really going to go out

1390
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,559
wearing that?

1391
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,920
What? I think it was funny. I don't know

1392
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,720
what to say. Something like that. Oh,

1393
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,800
let's do oddly specific. Yeah. If you

1394
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,240
watch this Safari video wearing merch

1395
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,079
from our 2 mill drop, you're awesome.

1396
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,240
Oh, I like that. Okay. If you watch this

1397
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,520
video with two drinks to the right of

1398
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,359
you on your nightstand while in bed,

1399
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,480
give yourself a high five and grab a

1400
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,119
third drink. If you watch this video on

1401
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,040
your couch and it was on the TV and

1402
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,920
you're with a loved one or two, give

1403
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,680
them a hug. Ah, I love that. That was

1404
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,680
awesome. Thank you guys again for 6
