1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,000
so I grew up in a lower middle class

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,160
family almost a third tier town in India

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,480
in my town at that time there was only

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,160
one person with the car I really loved

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,080
math I was very good at it I just wanted

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,640
to learn more math someone told my dad

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,640
you should put your son in computer

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,119
science because that's the the next big

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,599
thing and that's what probably got me

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,840
into one of the top colleges in India

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,240
called I quite lucky to get to Google in

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,320
early days I ran couple of things at

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,640
Google Google's mobile advertising which

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
actually I happen to Drew that to $50

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,040
billion in Revenue before joining

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
company called flip cart in India where

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,280
I was Chief product officer second time

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,440
I joined Google I walked on Google's

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,840
product search uh most recently I was

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,280
Chief product officer at coinbase and

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,199
helped coinbase through their

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,120
IPO I am surit chatur I'm founder and

23
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,280
CEO of Emma the full name of the

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,440
company's Enterprise machine assistant

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,400
EMA we built Emma as what we call a

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,320
universal AI employee so the idea is

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
Emma can collaborate with human

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
employees and take a lot of the

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,280
repetitive tedious task that humans do

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
today in

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Enterprise so I grew up in in India I

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,240
went to one of the top technical

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,759
institutes in India called IIT I was an

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,240
engineer in early years of my my journey

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,680
uh got a business degree from MIT I was

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,399
confused that oh should I be a

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,240
consultant investment banker and it took

38
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,079
me a little bit of time to realize no

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm a technologist at heart I need to go

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,439
back and just focus more on technology

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,200
quite lucky to get to Google in early

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,040
days I had no idea what product

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,040
management was before joining go to be

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,759
honest and I was an engineer I had a

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,799
business degree I interviewed with

46
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,399
Google and they said you can be a

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,799
product manager and had me they told me

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,560
oh your first job will be in actually

49
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,719
payments and billing and fixing their

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,080
Google's payments product I have no idea

51
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,560
what it is I like yeah that's fine just

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,920
go learn and figure it out that was

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,160
really interesting for me that kind of

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,160
uh culture where we hire really good

55
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,879
people really smart people and we

56
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,319
believe they can figure out anything I

57
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,200
was very lucky to I had the opportunity

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,720
to actually co-found Google's mobile ads

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,440
team so another engineer in myself we

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,040
started very modest team working on

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,080
mobile advertising at Google crew that

62
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,599
that business from 0 to $50 billion in

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,599
Revenue see at Google I built stuff that

64
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,159
were many times incredibly hard to build

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,920
many people told me they were impossible

66
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,200
to build this happens all the time in in

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,680
larger companies because people someone

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,360
will try the product that you are trying

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,920
to build before and they might have

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
failed they'll tell you oh no no don't

71
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,319
try it it already failed so far my

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,040
biggest learning was you know how to

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,080
take on very ambitious idea uh believe

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,680
in my conviction believe in my gut on

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,360
those ideas and really risk it all I

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,640
would always go to work I would tell my

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,239
team you know I'm ready to be fired

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,640
today but not doing anything unethical

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,840
or illegal but pursuing my idea when I

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,120
was running mobile ads so I came up with

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,519
the idea of click to call ADS there's a

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,920
button to call you can call the

83
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,080
advertiser directly that now it's a

84
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,120
multi-billion Dollar business for Google

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,040
you would think it's the most obvious

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,200
idea today but for some reason there's

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,159
tremendous resistance internally we

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,239
wanted to go and experiment in Google

89
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,480
you experiment everything and Google had

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,040
this massive experimentation framework

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,120
to launch anything you need to get like

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,239
significant volume like you need to show

93
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,760
a statistical significance of your

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,920
feature and at that time on mobile uh

95
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,560
the number of users were really low so

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,599
if we just follow the Norms of Google at

97
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,079
that time which is a large desktop

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,280
business the mobile features will take

99
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,600
at least 9 months or a year each to

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,600
gather enough data to launch that just

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,680
seems like too long and the the mobile

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,800
industry is moving really fast we can't

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,840
wait that long let's make a mistake and

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,720
turn this feature on for 50% of the

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,880
users and how long would it take like

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,000
like okay only just a few weeks if

107
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,080
somebody finds out of of course they

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,880
will find out I'll take the blame and

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,560
what are they going to do fire Me Maybe

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,919
that's that's fine so we made a mistake

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,479
and launched that feature 50% of course

112
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,520
I had to go and explain what happened

113
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,000
but then actually it is working really

114
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,440
well let's not unlaunch it and lot of

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
things we had to do in early days was

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,360
breaking the Norms when you build a lot

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
of success you create some norms for

118
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,840
that success and that becomes an

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,520
innovator for the next success because

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,720
those Norms is actually stopping you

121
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,400
from innovating so everything I did on

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,080
mobile I had to break a lot of norms

123
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,080
there are many many projects I did this

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,960
enormous internal resistance Google has

125
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,560
really smart people right if bunch of

126
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,360
smart people are vly against my idea I

127
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,880
think there is something good in it that

128
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,960
actually gets me fired up to pursue that

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,960
idea I think the the conviction on your

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,800
ideas is very important attribute of a

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,919
product manager of of any leader right

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,880
of course not stupid conviction but

133
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,919
conviction to the extent that you want

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,319
to take it all the way and test it out

135
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,759
that's how I have lived my career trying

136
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,039
out things that often seemed

137
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,520
contradictory and often seemed out there

138
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,520
a little

139
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,240
bit I was try running mobile ads at

140
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,680
Google doing extremely well I got

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,919
promoted many times it was the fastest

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,599
growing and largest business at Google

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,400
at that time you would think there is no

144
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,479
reason to leave back of my mind I was

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,960
getting a little worried that I will

146
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,599
never leave it's kind of so comfortable

147
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,080
in some way I've done well and that was

148
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,800
kind of worrying me a little bit that oh

149
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,280
I may become like a lifer and I I just

150
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,720
want to learn always learn more but the

151
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,599
flip cart thing was completely said

152
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,759
indeas I was visiting bunch of customers

153
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,080
in India what was curious was Indian

154
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,599
customers like flip cart and others at

155
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,000
that time had already made the leap to

156
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,639
Mobile so the India was a mobile first

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,400
company they skipped the desktop

158
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,280
generation so lot of the e-commerce was

159
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,160
90% of the gmv or the net the net

160
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,479
revenue was from mobile which is very

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
different from developed markets where

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,680
at that time it was still 90% was on

163
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,599
desktop or maybe 80% was on desktop it

164
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,720
was great to see that I was very curious

165
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,240
about that going back to India and

166
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,840
meeting lot of these customers I thought

167
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,800
uh this is the kind of EX completely

168
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,039
different thing thing that I could do

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,000
from Google it's a different country

170
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,199
very different business I would just

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,199
learn a

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,680
lot India was the last place where

173
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,639
e-commerce should have gone in the those

174
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,919
times so if you think about it the three

175
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,840
ingredients for e-commerce internet

176
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,800
electronic payments and Logistics at

177
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,120
that time very few Indians had credit

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,280
cards or debit cards the road

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,400
infrastructure was very poor so flip

180
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,879
cart a as a company had to take on this

181
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,360
enormous challenge of the infrastructure

182
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,759
of the country to build Ecommerce for a

183
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,479
billion people so how do get a product

184
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,440
like a village in India the second tier

185
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,080
30er town in India we had to design

186
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,680
special trucks that were thin that could

187
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,520
go through small lanes and alleys so we

188
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,919
had to solve a lot of the technical

189
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,960
challenges logistical challenges that

190
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:13,360
was really amazing learning for me so

191
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,759
flip cart actually got into an agreement

192
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,520
to uh get bought over by Walmart that

193
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,520
was kind of the motivation for me to

194
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,520
come back and rejoin

195
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,960
Google running a company is different

196
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,440
from popularity contest you cannot

197
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,479
please everyone and whenever if you try

198
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,839
to please everyone as you grow your

199
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,440
company then you will definitely

200
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,080
degenerate your culture the next 3 years

201
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,440
at Google when I ran shopping Google was

202
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,480
becoming a place which was not very

203
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,399
enjoyable to work anymore Google had

204
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,120
actually as a company changed

205
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,200
dramatically from cultural perspective

206
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,079
some of the things that were very

207
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,519
positive about Google had degenerated

208
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,440
into being very negative so Google was a

209
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,680
place where people would always express

210
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,519
their opinion very freely people could

211
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,079
discuss anything but you can can take

212
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
that to an extreme and then discuss

213
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,720
anything and everything that is outside

214
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,680
the scope of Google's main mission of

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
the business and there's everybody is

216
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,000
distracted so I felt actually very

217
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,160
fortunate to leave Google have done

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,600
something else have seen something

219
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,240
different at every stage of growth there

220
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,240
is a risk that your culture will

221
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,760
degenerate because you are hiring new

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,160
people you have to learn how to work in

223
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,880
a in a different setting and so on so we

224
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,760
have to be very aware and very

225
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,720
deliberate very intentional to maintain

226
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,320
culture in fact you have to take a

227
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,880
stance that this is our culture if you

228
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,880
as an individual don't align with our

229
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,480
culture there are other opportunities

230
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,519
out there other options out there yes

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,040
it's possible to maintain the culture

232
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,560
but you have to be ready to be unpopular

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,880
make hard calls and be very intentional

234
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,880
about maintaining the

235
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,560
culture look I have run very large teams

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,760
grown teams in in companies like Google

237
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,160
coinbase flip cart some of the best

238
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,640
companies in the world and one thing

239
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,160
that always bothered me we had really

240
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,440
talented people but then a large

241
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,680
percentage of their time was still spent

242
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,040
in repetitive work so the idea behind

243
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Emma is can we automate most of the

244
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,240
mundane tasks people have to do in

245
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,880
Enterprises and and free them up to do

246
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,560
more value added more creative tasks in

247
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,200
our journey first thing is we walked

248
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,240
very closely with customers very very

249
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,360
early on we build the product actually

250
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,279
working with multiple customers as

251
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,519
design Partners so from the get go we

252
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,480
knew there is there is a need we knew if

253
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,360
you build it at least there are a few

254
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,160
customers and I think the trick is to

255
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,200
figure out okay are this the only

256
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
customers who will use it or there is a

257
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,680
broader demand so you have to talk to

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
enough customers to recognize patterns

259
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,800
and make sure okay whatever you are

260
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,880
building is not too custom for this

261
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,920
given customer you may have to do some

262
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,880
custom work for your early customer but

263
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,760
you have to be very clear ey on which

264
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,959
part of your product is a platform that

265
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,000
can be used and which part is maybe you

266
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,440
are customizing a little bit for some of

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,200
your early customers the other advice

268
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,480
I'll give to any startup founder or

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,959
particularly AI founder focus on

270
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,240
building nothing matters we kept the

271
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,399
company in stealth for a year uh we did

272
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,839
not announce our fundraise we didn't

273
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,440
announce even incorporation so funny

274
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,320
story some of our employees in in India

275
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,040
will complain that what do I tell my

276
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
parents where do I work

277
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,399
work it just say Ste and there is no

278
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,720
ifite we kept it under radar uh and Ste

279
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,040
just so we can focus and not get

280
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,760
distracted by by everything that

281
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
happening you know there's too much

282
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,920
noise out there you can spend your

283
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,639
entire day on Twitter and talking to

284
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,959
many people and getting too much wisdom

285
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,560
you of course want to absorb that and

286
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,760
and look at what's happening in the

287
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,320
world but you have to have your own

288
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,920
conviction and you have to block it out

289
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,800
and focus that's so important because

290
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,880
when you build a great product

291
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,440
everything else will fall into place see

292
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,720
our long-term vision is uh will be a

293
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,040
conversational operating system for

294
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,240
every Enterprise out there I think there

295
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,720
will be a future where in every company

296
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,720
team of human employees will work with a

297
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,959
team of AI employees that's the world we

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,959
envision where uh companies with very

299
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:02,480
few people actually being able to create

300
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,440
enormous impact 100 people company

301
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,240
making a billion dollar Revenue how

302
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,320
about a 10 people company making a

303
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
billion dollar revenue or even a one

304
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,519
person company making a billion dollars

305
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,000
in revenue or more I think we will be

306
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,600
able to enable that in the future where

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
a few a human employees will work with a

308
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,480
a group of AI agents and and AI

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,839
employees like Emma to build really

310
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,839
large companies
