have we ever done a gift exchange

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,240

interests oh that's so nice I am [ __ ]

507
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,279
so excited for this song

508
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:42,520
what is it Chris T tell

509
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,960
us it is a Max action hunting series

510
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,679
archery set yeah and why is this

511
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,600
significant because when I was young I

512
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,279
took archery lessons really and I

513
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,520
actually had a whole Instagram account

514
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,360
for it really should we shout them out I

515
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,320
guess should we shout them out my uh my

516
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,279
plan is to that's more embarrassing for

517
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,720
me me I was dancing and stuff it was my

518
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,720
plan no I had a [ __ ]

519
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,799
Mohawk your your hair quiver I had a

520
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,159
quiver on oh my God yeah and this I

521
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,880
actually think this is just cool that's

522
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,640
kind of part of the reason why deers are

523
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,559
my favorite animals cuz I thought I I

524
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,120
liked archery and then I saw people like

525
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,720
killing and hunting deers I was like I

526
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,440
could never do that well in modern time

527
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,799
we use guns no one's really out there

528
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,880
with a bow and arrow anymore I know yes

529
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:29,240
they are like Hightech crossbows people

530
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,520
100% crossbows yeah but a bow yes Nick

531
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,559
like not like a yes people can use these

532
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,520
it's actually like the primary item of

533
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:39,159
what people use to H yeah scary if you

534
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,640
miss you don't scare the others wow I'm

535
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,760
amazing yeah then I saw I used to watch

536
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,720
videos on archery then it it led me down

537
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,039
like a Bad Rabbit Hole of like hunting

538
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,159
real animals and it made me really sad I

539
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,919
used to have everything I used to have

540
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,000
the arm guard dude so goofy and fun

541
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,679
don't call it goof here's the thing I

542
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,880

sword and you think that it would excite
