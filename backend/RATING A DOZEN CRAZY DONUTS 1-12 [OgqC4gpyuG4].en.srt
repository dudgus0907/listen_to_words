00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,240
[ __ ] eat it why is it like a little

236
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,839
doughy okay inspector eat it they just

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,640
eat the same it's it's definitely a

238
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,079
little less because hey let's think

239
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,760
about it if we don't like that that much

240
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,600
then this is more of it so technically

241
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,200
we like it less cuz I'd rather eat

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,240
less I'm okay with that thought process

243
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,959
cuz I oh you got it what you understood

244
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,040
what I said no I just don't care I want

245
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,760
to put that's where I'd put it no right

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,040
there all right okay all right next up

247
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,480

251
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,560

252
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,279

255
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
bless you all right look guys it smells

256
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,160
like a blueberry muffin it has like

257
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,839
purple dough it smells like a blueberry

258
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,120
muffin it's like blueberry like juices

259
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,760
what there's no juice in this Chris

260
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,440
we're going to try the donut it's a

261
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,839
blueberry muffin it literally tastes

262
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,519
like a it looks like a blueberry muffin

263
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,639
let's try it but whenever I think of

264
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,720
blueberry stuff I just feel like a

265
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,360
little like I'm in my dollhouse with my

266
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,240
blueberry muff in my dollhous I feel

267
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,240
like violet boa Guard from Willy Wonka

268
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,600
okay see this wouldn't be bad without

269
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,800
the cream there's no cream like the

270
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,639
frost icing Icing I honestly like it me

271
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,680
too it reminds me of a it tastes like a

272
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,680
blueberry muffin a little bite oh you're

273
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,440
right what a blueberry little bite yeah

274
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,600
muffin right no but little bite's

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,000
different than a muffin it's a little

276
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,240
bite yeah it's a little bite of a

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
[ __ ] muffin

278
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,000
idiot what are you talking about

279
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,680
definitely has has different

280
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,560
flavor a Chris you know a little bite

281
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,440
isn't like an actual food like it's

282
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,959
different like it's a the whole point of

283
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,079
it being a little bite is because the

284
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,600
size of it is a little bite of what it

285
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,600
actually is so when I say blueberry

286
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,440
muffin

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
but I would say oh a little bite but I

288
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,399
would eat a

289
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,320
blue I would eat a blueberry little bite

290
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,480
before I eat a blueberry muffin I'd

291
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,680
honestly say that that's the best one I

292
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,920
ate I agree I'll put it right there get

293
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,680

that's closer to Maple right how do you

308
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:56,160
feel about that I think blueberry is

309
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,040
better than that red one what do you

310
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,839
think Chris if you guys oh my God it

311
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,120
come Downs to me hand of agreement with

312
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
the order right now can I negotiate no

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,760
you can [ __ ] move that there or move

314
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,160
that there and that's your all what

315
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,399
about this order like this
