concept of the walk out the intro I

think that we need to Captivate the fans

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,360
immediately and that's that's why I made

59
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,720
my vision work uh if you want to if you

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,159

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,639
hit that move is Aura like the upside

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,520
down like break dance Nick doing it with

105
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,560

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,360
Matt you can like leap through us like

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,520
like leap through US kind of like that's

109
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,039
the vibe I might be able to do the Le

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,000
this one's some like corny [ __ ] but

111
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,919
if we hit that like floater move I think

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,080
we're I think we're in for some good

113
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:34,360
serious some serious intro action um

114
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,720
love the effort yeah this is not

115
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,600
happening I agree uh no one's looking

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
for you to agree you make zero decisions

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,800
around

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,360
here you wouldn't say thr get rid of the

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,600
board okay sorry

120
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,240
sorry I have one more mood board let's

121
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
see it okay this one I was thinking a

122
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,360
lot simpler I wanted to not get

123
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,560
distracted on one Niche moment of the

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,319
show so I was like another versus tour

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,440
just run the whole thing back it was

126
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,759
very successful for me no um don't I I

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
don't love agreeing with members of the

128
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,960
party who are tardy and Matt was late

129
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,599
today but we absolutely can't do this

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,560
one of my first rules was it needs to be

131
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,759
different from the other tours you can

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
get rid of this board

133
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,199
too you have anything else maybe that a

134
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
couple more notes I can go go ahead you

135
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,199
have anything else besides being late I

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,280
do actually I'm going to present for you

137
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,080
right

138
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,199
now this is actually uh all for show

139
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,400
there's nothing nothing in here I do

140
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,440
have a mood board that I made that I'm

141
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
ready to present to you guys if

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,759
and uh I hate to ask could I get the

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
yard stick maybe you are nowhere near

144
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,360
yard stick

145
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,080
privilege unless I get up the ass whoa

146
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,160
all right um so this is my kind of big

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,919
idea right so we have to integrate our

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,880
YouTube channel in a sense that's who we

149
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,240
are touring you know what I mean correct

150
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,000
but there there most of the time most of

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
the time when influencers can do this

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,879
gets a little bit on that corny line

153
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,800
we're in that corny zone so we got to

154
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,400
get out of that corny Zone a little bit

155
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,599
this is kind of where I I think is a

156
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,840
perfect place to be I think you guys all

157
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,639
remember filming the anonymous

158
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,879
confessions videos that we did this one

159
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,840
is from two years ago but does it maybe

160
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,160
ring a couple Bells mhm in here I filmed

161
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,639
the [ __ ] video yeah yeah we create

162
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,800
one of these put maybe a little QR code

163
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,240
scan enter your confession we react live

164
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,280
on stage they could say their

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
grandmother died that morning and we

166
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,080
have to talk about

167
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,039
it maybe something more light-hearted

168
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,960
like I love the triplets

169
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,400
no no that's boring I love the grandma

170
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,560
Anonymous can't get bullied can't say

171
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,160
anything stupid they say whatever they

172
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,319
want we react to it they could be top

173
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
left they could be top right all we know

174
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,720
is it's going to get red out loud how do

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,240
we feel about a boss I love it it's very

176
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,240
interactive uh uh uh uh uh how do we

177
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
feel about it boss you were late to work

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
today but there's one place you can't be

179
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,720
late and that's hitting the [ __ ] tour

180
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
bus when we take this on the road all

181
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,680
right so I think my idea is good but I

182
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
think we need a couple more concrete

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
things to do and then we can hit the

184
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,080
road I'd like to redeem

185
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,479
myself go for it okay so while I was

186
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,560
sitting here and I was thinking us

187
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,080
triplets tell each other everything you

188
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,360
know I love you

189
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,759
guys and I was thinking I just don't

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,120
like keeping secrets from you so how

191
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,360
funny would it be if I did now let me

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,400

randomly go out of the house shut our

196
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,760
location off and do something [ __ ]

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,640
insane so say on this day I go here and

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I Skydive out of a plane this is the

199
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,200

337
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,399
step two have to be hype we need to Hype

338
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,000
like I think we're missing that like in

339
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,680
your face VI okay Charlie so what I'm

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,680
thinking is

341
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,040
is

342
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,639
that here's my first vision board dep

343
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,880
two the stage is dark super dark can't

344
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,040
see a thing we tiptoe out there like

345
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,319
thieves in the

346
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,759
night thieves in the night pop smoke

347
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,240
reference no no no so then we're here

348
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
that's not even a pop Smoke song I don't

349
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,319
think well then we're here like a thief

350
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,160
in the night oh it is a pop Smoke song

351
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,639
yeah so then it's going type [ __ ] this

352
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,160
is the last step by the way and then

353
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,120
this is the aura move so if I do an

354
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,160
upside down hand spin Nick the aura move

355
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,360
you can do this like double kick lean B

356
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,680
on one hand you're going to have to work

357
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,680
on it we have to have a lot of practice

358
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Matt you leap through us like the

359
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,000
Kool-Aid Man breaking through a an

360
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,720
armored wall and every single time we've

361
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,480
done this 9.7 million viewers we've uh

362
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,040
