1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,440
I think there is no one siiz fits all

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,000
for an exceptional entrepreneur one of

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,360
the key characteristics though that I

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,160
often see in great Founders is they have

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,320
this really strong sense of always doing

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,520
what's best for the company in many ways

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,039
can be sa self-sacrificial that they

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,359
always put the company first and the

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,000
mission first if you want to be famous

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,240
this is not the place for you being

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,039
famous versus being paid a lot versus

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,519
being having an easy lifestyle all of

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
which is not true

14
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,160

everywhere change the world for

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,260
[Music]

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,640
good I'm so thankful to my parents my

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,600
mother and father lived through the

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
Korean War they came to the United

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,560
States to seek a better life uh with one

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,040
suitcase uh with the little money they

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,880
had uh in their pockets uh but what they

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,000
did have was an education that they were

43
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,960
both trained as medical doctors at that

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
time the United States had a severe

45
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,600
shortage shortage of medical doctors and

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,360
they were inviting overseas doctors to

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,320
come even if they didn't speak English

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,520
very well I think in my school we were

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,079
the only Koreans and I remember

50
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,360
distinctly one day my father calling me

51
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,680
in to his room to his bedroom I was 12

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,759
years old old at the time that's the

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
same age my as my oldest son at this

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,880
point and my father just sat me and said

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,799
hey Eric I need to have a talk with you

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,800
at that time my father with these

57
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,720
intense tears in his eyes told me Eric

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,400
you're growing up now you're 12 years

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,239
old you're about to become a teenager

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,920
and life is going to be hard because

61
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,239
you're an Asian American because you're

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Korean because of the color of your hair

63
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,040
the color of your eyes the shape of your

64
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,640
eyes the color of your skin life is

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,599
going to be difficult you will

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
immediately be discounted and I think

67
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,080
part of this was my father's own

68
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,200
experience in the workplace facing

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,360
racism uh there or uh maybe some bias as

70
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,280
well but he understood that for me as an

71
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,040
Asian-American that it was important for

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,000
me to understand that because of that

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,760
discount he instilled into me that we

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,560
really needed to be 12% 150% better so

75
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,080
to speak to uh really compare with our

76
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,720
our peers who didn't have this Asian

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
face or this background or so and that

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,360
really had a tremendous impact on my

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,920
life in many ways I felt a sense of

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,560
urgency that I had to perform that I had

81
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,440
to just be better in many ways that was

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
a really important lesson I think as

83
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,799
I've grown up and as I've matured I

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,159
realized that in many ways yes that bias

85
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,080
exists and yes the Prejudice exists and

86
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,560
and racism exists and yes education hard

87
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,120
work all those elements were keys for me

88
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,400
to be hopefully successful in life over

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,040
time what I've realized as well is that

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,720
I also need to embrace and not always

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,480
just perform for the sake of trying to

92
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,120
be better itself what if humility was a

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,120
superpower what if as myself I could

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Embrace that and not be afraid of that

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,799
that's something I'm really interested

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,319
and excited about going forward

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,280
too as an undergrad I had the

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,040
opportunity when I was at Yale to also

99
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,280
intern at McKenzie and Company during

100
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,599
the summer so in 2002 I I graduated from

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,519
undergrad and I was expected to start at

102
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,560
McKenzie right away I eventually I went

103
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,400
back to McKenzie and spent time there

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
for 2 years as a business analyst and

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
consultant I learned a lot I did a lot

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,000
of global projects I spent over 6 months

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,079
in China I spent time in Southeast Asia

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,079
as well spent time all over Europe and

109
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,439
so that really helped provide a Global

110
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,759
Perspective which is something you see

111
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,320
in goodw today as well then went to

112
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,160
Stanford University in 2005 and that's

113
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,400
where I met my co-founder chihua Chen

114
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,520
who was class of 2006 so we overlapped

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,240
for a year so in 2007 I had the

116
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
opportunity to join Maverick Capital

117
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,280
they were starting to build out their

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,639
private investing practice and so myself

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,120
and a gentleman named David singer we we

120
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,639
work very closely together from 2007 to

121
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,880
2014 and during that time we invested

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,680
all over the world and uh from early

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,039
stage to late stage we were part of the

124
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,960
YC y commentator Venture Capital

125
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,840
Syndicate so we invested in every single

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,720
y commentator company to really late

127
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,240
stage companies as well pre-ipo

128
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
companies too and that really gave me a

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,479
sense of the Art and Science of

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,610
investing and and really to adopt an

131
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,560
investor mindset

132
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,120
[Music]

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,440
actually our first deal in Korea was

134
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,360
coupon it was March of 2011 and then

135
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,960
soon after that we invested in cacao in

136
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,199
their series a yeah when we first

137
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,400
invested in Kong they were the 28th

138
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,000
social commerce company to launch in

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,680
just South Korea itself we launched a

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,120
survey in South Korea and we asked

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,840
dozens of people asking them to compare

142
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,639
Ticket Monster we make price coupon

143
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,319
others your retail experience as well

144
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,840
and over and over again for specifically

145
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,919
women in their 20s 30s they loved coupon

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,680
because of their customer service why

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,360
was that so important was because it

148
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,479
then created loyalty that if you had

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
really really strong customer service

150
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,919
consumers would come back to you because

151
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
they knew that they would be treated

152
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,039
well and that was a strong philosophy

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,479
that kpong had from the first day was

154
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,479
how do you wow your end your end

155
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,600
customer if you are doing something that

156
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,960
the market generally agrees with that is

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
a really hard way to make a profitable

158
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,080
investment because the the rest of the

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,520
Market's already there you have to have

160
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,400
some kind of contrarian or

161
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,479
differentiated insight and usually

162
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,360
that's through some kind of primary

163
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,520
research that you've done that no one

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,599
else has done itself and that was a key

165
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,880
to making that investment back in 2011

166
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,400
caca is a really interesting story I'm

167
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,160
I'm very thankful to Han Kim who's a

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,960
very close mentor and friend of mine

169
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,880
that helped introduce me to the company

170
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,960
prior to that we had an overall thesis

171
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,080
about mobile the the power of

172
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,520
smartphones and this whole transition

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,120
away from desktop to mobile Computing

174
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,000
and how there opportunity

175
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,759
for gaming for Commerce for

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
communications to happen on mobile and

177
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,479
we were looking for that killer out what

178
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,520
prompted me to really become interested

179
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,120
in caca and and to seek out the company

180
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,360
was a really close friend of mine

181
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,919
actually was visiting from South Korea

182
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,120
at the time that person had a Samsung

183
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,360
smartphone and I asked her why did you

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,360
buy this Samsung smartphone and she said

185
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,160
so I could use caca it actually saved

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,120
her money at the time every time you

187
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,639
sent a text message you were charged per

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,560
text and cacao made that free buying a

189
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,800
smartphone which was very expensive that

190
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,080
upfront cost was an investment to save

191
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,960
money over time because it provided this

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
core utility to everyone to be able to

193
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,319
communicate for free and that was an

194
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,879
Insight that it really struck me is that

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,680
people were willing to buy 300 400 $500

196
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,319
smartphones so they could just use caca

197
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,240
because they were saving money on the

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,360
other end of that that love that

199
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,639
customer love was something we saw

200
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,479
tremendous potential in so I remember

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,560
approaching the CEO the founder the

202
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,800
management team at k C once I got

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,599
introduced I remember flying to South

204
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,280
Korea and practicing the night before

205
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,720
presenting in Korean and the next day

206
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,240
actually when I I visited the the caca

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,639
headquarters and there was only like 20

208
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,159
people I remember pitching in Korean to

209
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,479
the to the the team there they w't

210
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,159
pitching me I made this whole

211
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,199
presentation about our thesis and the

212
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,159
research we had done all the consumers

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,919
we had talked to it was in Korean so I'm

214
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,720
sure it was terrible and it was uh with

215
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,560
a lot of stuttering they were maybe were

216
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,879
impressed by that and uh they were

217
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,800
willing to take our Capital early on but

218
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,759
we really saw not from the outside in

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,479
but through the consumer voice the love

220
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
for the product I remember at the time

221
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,759
there's a lot of people who thought that

222
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,759
investment in caca was crazy maybe even

223
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,280
some of the early team members weren't

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,520
quite sure about the future but when we

225
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,599
talk to Consumers when we talk to people

226
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,879
who actually use the product they loved

227
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,080
it so so much often times one of the

228
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,199
things I love to do when I go to cities

229
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,320
whether it's London or New York I just

230
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,800
like to hang out in the subway you can

231
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,519
see what apps they're using just the

232
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,240
color the icons they're using and when

233
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,360
you go to Korea a lot more people were

234
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,760
starting to use this yellow icon cacao

235
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,560
and then you would talk to them why did

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,080
they use it I can save money I can

237
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,120
communicate with my friends there's a

238
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,600
group chat that becomes my community and

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
so that was our key Insight is that you

240
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,080
could scale this and create a powerful

241
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,720
Network effect that as more people got

242
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,640
on the platform it would benefit all the

243
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,720
pre-existing users as well that's it's a

244
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,160
really powerful phenomenon that

245
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,800
increases retention that as more people

246
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,680
get onto the product the product gets

247
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,079
better how many of those can you name

248
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,079
there are very very few companies that

249
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,360
do that and so once we saw that Insight

250
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,560
we felt a very strong Comm uh conviction

251
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,959
to invest in the company they were both

252
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,320
very early stage deals series a for the

253
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,079
caca and kind of series a plus for kpong

254
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,839
the returns were massive on kind of a

255
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:30,839
venture scale kind of the 100x 300X type

256
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,839
scales

257
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,839
I think most Venture Capital firms in my

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,640
experience do great work but they don't

259
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,760
necessarily have a strong sense of

260
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,760
mission and that's what was important to

261
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,519
us when we started goodw was to have a

262
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,120
really clear mission statement again to

263
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,079
empower exal MERS everywhere to change

264
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,000
the world for good good water had a

265
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,600
tremendous impact on the Venture Capital

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,360
ecosystem because we changed the mindset

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,440
to go from a Ecentric mindset where you

268
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,560
have individual venture capitalist being

269
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,160
celebrated for how much money they made

270
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,519
shifting that there's nothing wrong with

271
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,480
that but shifting it more to a mindset

272
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,920
of how can we as a vendor Capital

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,200
industry have positive impact itself if

274
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,800
good water many many many years from now

275
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
is known for that capital is a really

276
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,079
really valuable resource that you have

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
to Steward and that's why we're called

278
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,160
good water we think water is similar to

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
technology and capital water is the

280
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,240
source of life for every living organism

281
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,839
but the lack of water or too much water

282
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,640
can lead to destruction it's itself and

283
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,160
technology and capital is the exact same

284
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,519
thing that you have to Steward it it can

285
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,160
be the source for so much positive

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,399
influence in the world but it can also

287
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,200
be used for not so good things too that

288
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,519
technology and capital isn't always the

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,399
source of goodness in the world too so

290
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
we want to be the good water in the

291
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,320
Venture Capital ecosystem we also

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
thought that the world didn't need

293
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,399
another venture capital firm there are

294
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,399
so many great Venture Capital firms out

295
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,079
there sequoia Benchmark you know Excel

296
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
Partners there there are so many great

297
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,200
Venture Capital firms out there the

298
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,839
world didn't need necessarily another

299
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,600
venture capital firm but what if you

300
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,399
could create a venture capital firm that

301
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,639
was not only Mission oriented but

302
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,399
focused on consumer internet consumer

303
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,320
technology itself a lot of venture

304
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
capital firms at the time and still

305
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,760
today Diversified away from consumer

306
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,600
Tech they went to Enterprise SAS or

307
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,600
security or Hardware or climate Tech or

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,800
biotech if you think about the best

309
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Venture Capital firms where they started

310
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,680
was by investing in companies like

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Google like Amazon like eBay six out of

312
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,279
the eight large companies in the world

313
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,440
are all consumer tech companies like

314
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,000
Facebook as well not only are there

315
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,720
great Equity returns there but if you

316
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,519
own that end cut customer relationship

317
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,200
then you can create so much Innovation

318
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,600
that backward integrates all the way

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,279
into the Enterprise as well so we had

320
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,959
this thesis that consumer technology

321
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,079
consumer internet was incredibly

322
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,120
powerful that owning those End customer

323
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,839
relationships was very powerful that

324
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,079
would span not just social networking

325
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,639
not just e-commerce but that span also

326
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,360
Financial Services Healthcare education

327
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,519
all these big Industries would be

328
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,079
increasingly consumerized because you

329
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,519
could own those End customer

330
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,320
relationships through digital technology

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,639
that was our big thesis when we started

332
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,680
the firm in 2014 at goodwi our

333
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,040
philosophy is that investing is both an

334
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,959
art and a science and so we leverage our

335
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,600
technology and our software to get to

336
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,639
the truth of the science part as quickly

337
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,480
as possible of our 65 66 person team

338
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,240
two-thirds of that team are actually

339
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,320
data scientists product managers and

340
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,600
engineers and since day one we've been

341
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,000
building an infrastructure a software

342
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,199
layer to enable us to look at consumer

343
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,760
technology companies so we find so much

344
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:44,959
value in looking at the data being able

345
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,760
to have this infrastructure to see

346
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,440
companies on a global basis we track

347
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:53,079
over 10 million companies in real time

348
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,839
so we have very very accessible reports

349
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,639
consumer research analytics benchmarks

350
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,600
that allow us to understand a company we

351
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,680
think better than any other firm because

352
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
we have so much data around it and we

353
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,639
know how to apply it so when we see a

354
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,360
new opportunity to invest in we're very

355
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,760
quickly able to assess is this company

356
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,760
Best in Class not only on growth but

357
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,560
also retention customer love what's

358
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,760
their differentiation all the hard

359
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,800
science of investing we've really locked

360
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,680
into a very strong process and a

361
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,519
platform itself what's as important and

362
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,959
it goes with it is the art part and

363
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,959
that's really understanding the

364
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,519
entrepreneur understanding that person's

365
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:35,079
will and desire to win that person's

366
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,560
desire to have impact Itself by taking

367
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:41,040
all the science and being able to really

368
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,720
get to truth as quickly as possible then

369
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
you can spend a lot more time on

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,279
spending time with the entrepreneur

371
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
understanding their M motivations

372
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,320
understanding what their long-term goal

373
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,920
is their vision for the company so if

374
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,880
you have seven days in the week in the

375
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,800
old process it used to take six days in

376
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
the week to do all the science and then

377
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,720
you have one day to maybe understand the

378
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,920
soft part or the art we've reversed that

379
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,120
is that it takes one day to understand

380
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,880
the science part of it the analytics all

381
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,920
the components that you can have

382
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,320
software and our data platform really

383
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,839
understand very quickly and spend the

384
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,880
other six days to really understand the

385
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,079
entrepreneur can we partner with this

386
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,000
person they have a similar philosophy

387
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,079
around putting the company first are

388
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,440
they open to feedback doing reference

389
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,720
checks deeply those soft elements of

390
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,720
what makes for a great entrepreneur

391
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,680
we're able to spend the vast majority of

392
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,680
time because of this dual approach

393
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,639
between Art and Science and so that's

394
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,759
been the harded soul of good water since

395
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,399
day one and something we continue to

396
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,399
innovate on

397
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,320
too we interview a lot Venture Capital

398
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
Associates VPS principles and partners

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,079
one of our screening criteria if you

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,320
want to be famous this is not the place

401
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:52,040
for you the goodw approach is one that

402
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,360
is obsessed with finding generational

403
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,199
companies that will have tremendous

404
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,160
impact one firm that I admire greatly is

405
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,360
seoa capital and they had this saying

406
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,440
that they were just one away if they

407
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,279
just missed one great deal then that

408
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,240
would lead them to potentially being a

409
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,519
mediocre firm and so they had this

410
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,120
obsession with finding great companies

411
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,759
if that is someone's singular purpose if

412
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,160
that is their Obsession as well which is

413
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,920
to find great companies and to invest in

414
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,720
them that's what we look for in young

415
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,440
Venture capitals and I think that's what

416
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,800
young people who are looking to get into

417
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,440
the Venture Capital should ask

418
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,040
themselves is this something that I'm

419
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,560
really obsessed with that I would go the

420
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,560
ends of the Earth to I will fly over

421
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,399
200,000 plus miles going back and forth

422
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,199
to countries to visit entrepreneurs it's

423
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,399
a really hard lifestyle it's not

424
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,720
glamorous but you do it because you love

425
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,800
it that you are obsessed with finding

426
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,360
that insight about a company that will

427
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,040
lead to investment that no one else in

428
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,399
the world might see and if that's

429
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,519
something that young people really want

430
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,360
to do and they're willing to put in the

431
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,079
hard work to have the discipline it's

432
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,759
like playing a sport you have to be like

433
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,079
an athlete you have to be able to invest

434
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,079
in your craft day in day out and get

435
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,560
incrementally better every week and it's

436
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,680
not something that will ever be handed

437
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,959
to you maybe some venture capitalist

438
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,759
just get lucky that's certainly possible

439
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,880
but to sustain a franchise and to

440
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,959
sustain a career over the long term it

441
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,240
really takes a lot of discipline hard

442
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,480
work and an intensity that is driven by

443
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,279
a passion to find and invest in great

444
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,600
companies and support them throughout

445
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,600
the life cycle of growth I teach a class

446
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,800
on this at various institutions but how

447
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,440
do you have an investor mindset that is

448
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,079
a able to see the big picture always

449
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,360
having that big picture that home run

450
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,480
Vision in your mind B understand what

451
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,720
are the key components that allows that

452
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,319
to come true what do you have to believe

453
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,800
for that big Vision to come true C

454
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,600
understand what are the key risks to

455
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,120
those and being able to D then research

456
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,000
those and underwrite those risks and

457
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,120
ultimately e taking a leap of faith that

458
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
allows you to put it all together to

459
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,360
have conviction in your idea whether

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,440
you're an investor or whether you're a

461
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,680
Founder having those key components and

462
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,279
being able to break it down I think

463
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,839
having this mindset for the key

464
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,039
decisions you need to make is something

465
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,039
that we talk about internally we

466
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,480
certainly teach it for our investors and

467
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,839
also I think great CEOs also have this

468
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,559
investor mindset too because they're

469
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,280
doing Capital allocation and they're

470
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,400
making decisions so how do you go

471
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,439
through that framework and be able to

472
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,079
follow it and then also know when not to

473
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,520
follow it when do you know to break the

474
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,679
rules too that's really where the Poetry

475
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,480
comes up about that you can able to

476
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,679
innovate and create new things when

477
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,840
you're able to have exceptions but to do

478
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,080
that you actually have to know the

479
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,720
Frameworks and the rules first we preach

480
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,039
both that the Frameworks are really

481
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,919
helpful but also really importantly

482
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,800
knowing when to break the rules too is

483
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:55,180
really important too

484
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:55,180
