[Music]

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,040
we're on tour obviously and we're in a

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,079
bus and still moving so it's probably

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,760
it's probably really loud but ignore

5
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,320
that we're gonna just do a couple like

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,300
these sit down moments throughout the

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,500
video where we're like explaining what's

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,879
going on because sometimes you need

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,620
context throughout this video I'll

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,300
probably put this in the beginning yeah

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,480
disclaimer that we're gonna pop up like

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,379
this explaining what's going on

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,379
oh I'm washing my face

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,700

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,619

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,560

19
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,479
foreign

20
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,040
this is absolutely happening

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,759
built in 1924 on the original location

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
of the element Barracks the building was

23
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,360
originally constructed as a Medical Arts

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,000
Building with family doctors offices

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,100
dentists surgical floors emergency rooms

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,500

from dentists to surgeons in 1976 the

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,700
hospital closed and it was turned into

31
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,379
an office building until it was

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,959
eventually sold or transformed into a

33
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,319
hotel why would they make it a hotel

34
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,319
station

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,280
was purchased by the Hilton family and

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,420
turned into a DoubleTree while keeping

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,420
them

38
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,420

was a waiting area the basement is also

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,620
said to be haunted which was formerly

45
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,120
the morgue in 1984 when the building was

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,800
first purchased and turned into a hotel

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,780
the construction crew entered the

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
basement and began Renovations what they

49
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,560
found was hundreds of boxes of human

50
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,560
ashes from unclaimed Bots

51
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,519

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,319
he said they took the ashes that they

53
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,940
found from the unclaimed bodies they

54
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,540
just spread them along and then built

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,540
this [Â __Â ] on time

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,459

wheeled down the hallways accompanied by

63
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,340
strange bones and labored breathing only

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,640

just so startled that he was trying to

202
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,800
even make it in our elevator because we

203
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,560

that was so stupid

222
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,740
so then as you can tell I went into the

223
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,200
restroom to take a [Â __Â ] in Emily Morgan

224
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,800
Hotel yeah and that red wall that's

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,839
behind the toilet oh my God that scared

226
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,079
the [Â __Â ] out of me because we're in a

227
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,779
moving bus but that was terrible yeah

228
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:27,000
but anyway I was sitting on the toilet

229
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:29,279
and I wasn't flushing or anything wrong

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,880
big movements were going on like I was

231
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,560
in the beginning process but the red

232
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,920
door the red wall that's behind me

233
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,920
murdered like three knocks that were

234
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,200
like loud but like quick but it was

235
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,260
literally like

236
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,640
like that yeah three solid knocks but it

237
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,440
was also really terrifying because

238
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,260
everyone could kind of sense Chris's

239
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,060
like fear no And Me me saying like like

240
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,920
when I went in saying oh no one [Â __Â ]

241
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,240
with me whatever blah blah like I

242
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,339
genuinely thought leaving the bathroom

243
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,019
like it was one of them like joking

244
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,160
around but once I asked everyone and

245
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,320
they all said we're not faking anything

246
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,240
like you can genuinely see my fear the

247
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,860
whole rest yeah like I was ready to get

248
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,899
the [Â __Â ] out of there you know I was

249
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,079
actually dead ass terrified he was just

250
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,300
scary because no and also it didn't look

251
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,920
like he worked tier one he like he got

252
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,839
in our elevator while it was closing

253
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,399
that was the weirdest part the door was

254
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,120
closed then he like stuck his arm and

255
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,320
jumped in it was full

256
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,240
and then see if he actually came out

257
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,459
like once he like tried to edit your

258
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,140
stuff maybe he wouldn't oh my God no I

259
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,339
said I was scared I was already like so

260
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,600
close to myself that's why I didn't

261
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,760
think anyone else was gonna try and win

262
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
oh uh that's a bucket list experience

263
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,720

264
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,220
hotel ever y'all can't say that spooky

265
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,480
he was just so confused he didn't really

266
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,160

275
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,220
experience oh

276
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
shuffling

277
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
1950

278
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,320
. we're going to see the hospital

279
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,420
because like it's not gonna let us watch

280
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,320
we're gonna see the

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,320
Mountain okay

282
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,579

283
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,100

284
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,660
here earlier

285
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,120
see that was terrifying I get stuck in

286
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,760
this [Â __Â ] that was scary if I get

287
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,500
stuck in this elevator we're gonna see

288
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,500
things that we we wish we didn't see

289
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,139
they call us the [Â __Â ] Ghostbusters I

290
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,680
think scary yeah it is this hallway's

291
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,680
terrifying down

292
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,000
at this point where we hit the elevator

293
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,279
down buttons we're ready to go back to

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,260
the lobby but we want to stay in an

295
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,880
elevator where it's just our crew so

296
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,860
we're keep denying people that are

297
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,100
showing up like in one in the elevator

298
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,220
alone but so then this lady comes up the

299
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,620
elevator she's fully alone right and

300
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,000
she's holding her purse like at her

301
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,459
waist like

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,740
angle this camera at me this lady has

303
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:35,100
her purse and she's that ass holding it

304
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,560
like she's holding it like this

305
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,480
in the back of the elevator and then so

306
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,220
it opens and then me and Matt didn't

307
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,920
even see her in it so we started walking

308
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,540
on and then in the clip you can hear I

309
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,820
think Nick was like oh no we'll wait but

310
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,500
if this lady was literally standing like

311
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,839
this holding the purse and she was like

312
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,180
I'm going down you guys would you guys

313
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,180
like to join me terrifying like this and

314
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,519
this and as she said that memo who was

315
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:04,320
recording literally this exact moment

316
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:07,019
she was awesome seconds before she gone

317
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,240
kind of dirt kind of yeah like while her

318
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,740
elevators coming to our floor and while

319
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,540
the elevators opening she's talking to

320
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,980
Matt and Chris you can hear while I'm

321
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,600
taking a photo you have to pay super

322
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,060
close attention while I'm taking a photo

323
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,980
of Chris and Maddie and Matt you here

324
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,779
beeping from Memo's camera and he's been

325
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,820
filming since we started tour and then

326
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,800
after this Vlog he's been filming ever

327
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,120
since we were at that hotel so it's been

328
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,860
like a week and a half that he's been

329
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,779
filming and he's not filmed for stuff

330
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,820
like on the news like he's yeah he's a

331
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,160
professional he does not miss not messed

332
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,959
up filming anything so it's really scary

333
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,699
because that's like his camera's cutting

334
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,260
and you can literally see his fear of

335
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,600
like yeah he knows he didn't touch him

336
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,279
and there's a clip where I turn the Vlog

337
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,120
camera fast enough and it literally

338
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,120
shows him not clicking

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,120
yeah

340
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,740
take one take one photo of us

341
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,959
foreign

342
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:14,519
okay down

343
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:17,600
come on no do you see they're cut look

344
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,600
oh look like okay

345
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,260
the camera keeps like stopping and

346
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,260
starting recording by itself

347
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,980
there's a lot of us

348
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,980
we're good

349
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:41,100
show yourself what happened

350
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,139
make yourself really the name of the

351
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,540
world

352
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:48,899
okay we're good where are we going Lobby

353
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,899
or is it ground is it g

354
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,199
yeah do not put LL that's lower level

355
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,199
list

356
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:03,860
come on in let's go let's go thank you

357
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:06,600
holy Lord no that was scary the camera

358
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,579
I heard like I wasn't expecting to have

359
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,559
this much activity the first moment yeah

360
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,299
what if we like it then we're

361
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,620
Lobby because we're done but once we got

362
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,959
to the lobby we realized there's a

363
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,220
staircase down to the lower level and we

364
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,600
weren't gonna go to the lower level

365
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,459
because it was the crematorium before

366
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,319
and that was terrifying but once we

367
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,179
found out that the lobby like led to it

368
