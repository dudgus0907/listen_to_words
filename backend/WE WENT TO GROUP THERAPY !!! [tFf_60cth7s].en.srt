where if I shower and he showers at the

51
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,240
same time it will cut the water out how

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,119
does this lead to the Cane's it gets

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,640
there he goes I am so lack of energy cuz

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,239
I haven't eaten that I had to get out of

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,200
the shower early because I feel like I

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,920
haven't eaten enough to even wash myself

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,200
properly so I so I try to be a superhero

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,239
and I'm like we got to go get you some

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,040
food get out of the house okay we get to

60
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,840
the Cane's drive-thru right and he says

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,120
I think I just want french

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,959
fries I said you couldn't even wash

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,400
yourself fully and all you want is

64
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,760
french fries put some chicken in that

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,040
man's plate I don't I don't understand I

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,200
mean so this was really important to you

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,160
Matt that you this is Matt I mean I mean

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
but it was important that that so it was

69
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,400
important to you Nick yes that you had

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,400
to have french fries the or all I could

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,159
think of that I wanted was french fries

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,280
I think the underlying issue here was I

73
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,319
was I was so hungry but I didn't know

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,080
what I wanted to eat and Matt went for

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,879
an immediate solution and I was not I

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,599
don't think I was prepared for the so

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,840
did you guys make a scene at the uh no

78
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,720
there there was no scene um there was

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
there was internal scene nobody I don't

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,239
know no one else saw those Outsiders all

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,799
we were strictly in the drivethru but

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,000
Matt calls you dramatic a lot I call him

83
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,239
dramatic he call dramatic a lot at least

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,799
once a day the funny thing is is a is

85
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,280
someone who's constantly calling other

86
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,280
people dramatic are they not dramatic

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
themselves for feeling that

88
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,200
way how do you identify dramatic

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,840
that's I think someone freaking out

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,439
about [ __ ] being dramatic means they're

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,640
being dramatic and he's like oh you're

92
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,920
so dramatic like that's a dramatic

93
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,519
Outburst Nick his favorite phrase other

94
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,200
than hello and good night and good

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,920
morning is I can't do this I can't right

96
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:49,360
we so so so I say I say oh oh look at I

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,879
what I want so so I say Nick what is it

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,640
what wait wait what is it that you can't

99
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,720
do what are you trying to what are you

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,760
trying to I think it's like kind of like

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,439
um when there's like an awkward silence

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,879
barrier and it's like when your your

103
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,040
go-to is like oh how's the weather yeah

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,040
mine mine is I can't do this does that

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,879
sound dramatic Dr Sinclair please be

106
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,760
honest it sounds like you're frustrated

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,760
I am thank you for validating that

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,199
feeling when you say I can't do that you

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
saying I can't go any further what's

110
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,360
going on I think I think we all carry a

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,840
lot of stress and the minute that

112
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,759
something is happening I don't want to

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,600
do it so I say I can't do this when in

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,120
reality May deep down you can

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,160
yeah it's not a matter if I can't it's

116
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,880
more if I don't want to maybe I'll start

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
saying I don't want to do this so can

118
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,639
you think of a better phrase I don't

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,759
want to do this maybe better than I

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,840
can't I don't know I don't want to is

121
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,320
still like there's there's a possibility

122
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,080
better we're going in the right I don't

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,160
want to elude like I still could you

124
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,160
know maybe maybe I need some more time

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,000
to deal with this I like that do so so I

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,400
can't do this as Sam we also post every

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Friday too

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,840
and Nick often waits till Thursday night

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,840
to do it edit the video to like plan it

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,800
so he'll be editing on Thursday night

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,520
yeah and then it has to happen by

132
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,039
tomorrow because we post every Friday

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,880
and then he'll go I can't do this

134
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,639
anymore but in reality he had the whole

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,199
week to pre-plan and edit the video so

136
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,720
why don't you do it so so what are you

137
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,120
doing th so is there it sound like

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
there's

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,240
procrastination yeah but also the only

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,240
reason I the only reason I procrastinate

141
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,960
is because I'm the only one with the I

142
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,199
have the ability to procrastinate

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,440
because I have a requirement Matt and

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,560
Chris can't even procrastinate cuz they

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
have nothing to do he may edit and that

146
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,680
may be his requirement right guess who

147
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,680
does his laundry Dr

148
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,120
Sinclair let me guess I me this guy

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,400
right here really yeah his dirty draws

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm washing those mhm what would be

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,319
under his pants if I didn't wash his

152
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,120
underwear Matt wouldn't own close if I

153
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
didn't make the YouTube videos and post

154
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,319
them because he wouldn't have money so

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240
what would Matt would have nothing to

156
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,360
watch but sometimes you and Nick fight

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,360
over little things like who ate the last

158
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,199
candy bar or if he keeps stealing a sip

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,400
of your drink that one's big the word

160
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,199
stealing is crazy to me so the word

161
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,160
would you say when I ask you to share

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,160
one sip of a beverage it's

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,479
stealing I think that no matter what if

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
I took this from you right now and I

165
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,919
took this sip right W wo wo exposure

166
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,919
therapy was this was this not moments

167
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,599
ago your drink but I don't care I'm glad

168
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,599
you had a sip of a drink that I could

169
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,240
literally I still have more in here

170
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,039
right but if Dr Sinclair here had a

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,120
drink and I grabbed his that would be a

172
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,840
little different right that would be

173
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,800
stealing that would be that would be

174
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,039
stealing right cuz I just I I just met

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,919
Dr Sinclair 30 how long has it been 25

176
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,039
minutes ago 30 minutes ago you know like

177
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,160

Matt if Matt has a soda right and I

179
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
don't want to drink an entire soda right

180
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I'll like I'll say hey Matt can I have a

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,639
sip of your drink I'll take the drink

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,919
I'll take a sip Matt just he does he

183
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,000
doesn't want at time he doesn't want a

184
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:21,479
full soda but I did and now my full soda

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,520
privilege gone like that in a second cuz

186
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,160
he wants a sip cuz now I I'm not that

187
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,160
important you can't just open another

188
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,720
soda I yes but it I'd rather take a sip

189
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,599
of ma drink and not finish my own where

190
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,000
I think that Matt Matt can be willing to

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,720
sacrifice a sip for the greater good of

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,879
not polluting the Earth with the waste

193
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,240
of another C is that a little dramtic

194
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,000
dramatic Dr sinair a little bit right

195
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,520
he'd rather me pollute Earth I don't

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,520
think he can do

197
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,479
this do yes where me Matt and Chris

198
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,919
being brothers and hang out every single

199
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,879
day and arguing every single day since

200
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,120
we were kids I think that the power of

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
our word

202
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,720
is nullified a little bit because we're

203
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,560
so open with arguing with each other if

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
that makes sense so it doesn't seem as

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,720
intense when we're arguing because we do

206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,560
it all the time that's good like if

207
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,319
someone ar communic your normal

208
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,159
communication yeah just your normal

209
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,400
communication yeah like our our normal

210
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,720
communication is like if I saw two

211
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,639
friends arguing how me and Matt argue

212
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
sometimes it'd be like how are they even

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,240
friends with each other but for me and

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,240
Matt I feel like it makes sense mhm

215
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,360
that's true with siblings mhm cuz you

216
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,520
can bend that that bridge a little more

217
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,760
yeah so when the when when there's an

218
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,680
argument does he go back and bring up

219
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,640
old things and oh oh yes he's a big name

220
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,880
caller this one well give an example I'm

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,320
not going to share No example no example

222
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know if I'm much of a name call

223
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,000
it Nick you really hate when someone

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,200
with no profile pictures comments on

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,200
hating you yeah why and how does it make

226
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,680
you feel the reason it bothers me is

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,920
because if you were if you were face to

228
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,800
face with someone you don't have the

229
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,760
option to like conceal what you're

230
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,279
saying right so the internet allows

231
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,640
people to speak directly to somebody

232
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,720
without you knowing exactly who they are

233
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,079
and so a lot of these keyboard Warriors

234
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,360
what I like to call them and they like

235
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:20,040
comment away angrily they're doing that

236
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,279
out of they they're holding up an iron

237
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,120
shield in front of themselves saying

238
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,720
like oh I can say all this about this

239
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,600
person because they have no idea what's

240
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,680
behind curon number one right and

241
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,920
usually it's some ugly scary goblin that

242
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,240
lives in the middle of nowhere that's

243
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,480
butting into business that they don't

244
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,880
need to butt into right yeah and you

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,640
can't respond no there's it's not worth

246
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,920
responding to it because there's so many

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
of these little trolls gallivanting away

248
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,920
in a

249
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,680
cave yeah it's a good good analogy of

250
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,200
those people yeah I don't think we can

251
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,440
help you with that one yeah no that's

252
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,640
just that's an underlying issue the

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,160
other night Nick said you pick one night

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,680

attention to the TV oh Jesus what is

264
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,320
night when Nick said I quote you take

265
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,560

268
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,240

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,279
night M was being loud and dramatic and

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,120
you kind of stepped out of your again

271
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,240
comfort zone play Play One More Time

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,240

273
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,839
good we got a good angle that oh my

274
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,560
goodness brother all right basically I

275
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,760
took some moments from our videos where

276
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,480
maybe we were a little hostile or angry

277
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,680
so we can review them and how we act and

278
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,200
how we act in real life scenarios oh God

279
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,880
nightmare you killed me I was stabbing

280
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,480
person in my dream crying and shedding

281
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,959
tears and freaking out cuz I didn't want

282
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,920
to kill him but in my dream I had to

283
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,680
like

284
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,600
what I don't know I was just thinking

285
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,079
maybe we can have some advice that might

286
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,519
be symbolism of anger yeah so how did

287
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,839
this how did this come about to be

288
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:31,240
honest with you I don't even

289
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,240

thanks a

291
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,680

292
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
happened here I lightly tapped my

293
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
brother look at that start that nothing

294
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,920
about that is light that's what I'm

295
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,959
saying that's what I'm saying the first

296
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,839
like are these comparable off the off

297
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,560
the armrest yeah are those comparable H

298
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,480
so okay so what is the best way heed

299
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,279
communicating when someone's on our

300
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,000
phone on their phone I think waiting for

301
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,160
eye contact okay will help us all or

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,839
maybe like hey are you ready to listen

303
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,360
first okay so we should we tap that

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,079
person or should we that's up to say

305
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,279
something maybe like if it was gentler

306
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,880
and like not gentler yes like you tap my

307
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,279

something right maybe ta I'll use my

310
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,399
words from here on out that's good

311
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:41,880
Nick if you [ __ ] ever hit me again

312
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,880
knock [ __ ] tee literally that's why I

313
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,720
saying just start sitting here in the

314
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,240
video it's like what you did wasn't

315
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,399
funny well what you did wasn't funny

316
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,399
either oh my God I'm beding

317
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,880
I think this shows our good

318
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,839
communication I don't think so

319
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,079
communication look we we we end up at a

320
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,680
at a solution here Matt Matt intervenes

321
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,519
Matt Matt interven this isn't a viable

322
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
solution Matt intervenes and me and

323
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,519
