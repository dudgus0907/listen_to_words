30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,280
now what the [ __ ] what what's the to

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
embrace no guys you always freak out

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,640
when I say [ __ ] like that but it's like

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,280
come on we're back home yeah oh my God

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,560
we're in the van together mhm like

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,880
always as Rose okay okay I don't even

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,560
this doesn't even happen to me cuz I

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,119
don't eat it but like when people make

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,560
like the mac and cheese but they'll grab

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,799
like a second mac and cheese box and

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
open it so that theirs is extra cheesy

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,119
and then put like the mac and cheese

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,920
back in the thing or like if you have a

43
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,520
Ramen and then take two seasoning

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,560
packets for and you make it like extra

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
chickeny yeah and then you leave the

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,320
other Ramen packet so the next person

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,960
that goes to get it is only getting the

48
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,680
noodles and isn't getting the seasoning

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,200
well you should like you should just

50
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,240
throw away the second pack that's what I

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,799
would do what I'm saying like the next

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
person is going to be like oh like if

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,119
the last Nick a bonus

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,680
seasoner wrong correct Nick do I do that

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,799
Matt I don't know I know that Nick has

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
done that in the past would I make my

57
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,879
Mac and Cheese extra

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,360
cheesy yeah are you serious not extra

59
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,879
cheesy but you would make your Ramen

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,480
extra like flavorful I would do that

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,959
correct I've seen you do

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
it where the [ __ ] are my notes I think

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,319
tourniquets are like the craziest thing

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,920
ever Nick can you don't say [ __ ]

65
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,400
bleeding out and they just like tie the

66
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,800
limb off what why do you bring up tour I

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,160
had this charer and I was like wrapping

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,000
it around my leg and I think of like in

69
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,599
like those zombie movies when someone's

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,239
like arm gets bit I think it's just

71
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,680
corny if you have to squint I squint all

72
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,200
the time I know I think I just think

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,760
it's cringe like it's like walk closer

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,680
like if someone's like this like if

75
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,959
someone got up and walked closer or

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,519
something instead of squinting you'd say

77
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,120
the same thing now what like just what

78
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,560
you can't see from over there yeah well

79
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,640
no it's just like I just think it's like

80
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,840
dude if you're squinting no it's worse

81
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,560
when you're like in a seat that you

82
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,040
can't really get up from like if you're

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,519

isn't he so cute we he needed to come

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,000
home he should sit right next to the

161
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,160
camera so now we just like he's watching

162
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,919
us film I just added a new thing to my

163
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,479
list a moment ago of things that annoy

164
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,360
me and it's when people say a big no no

165
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,919
like oh that'd be a big no no he added

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,720
it to his list cuz I said it correct I I

167
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,560
can see Matt like with little streamers

168
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,680
like like flipping around in the Park

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,080
yeah okay now I'm going to throw it this

170
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,400
way so you can't grab it again a

171
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,000
privilege taken away I have um I think

172
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,280
that they should make a wambulance like

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,919
if someone's just crying and they don't

174
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,360
need an ambulance and people are oh we

175
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,479
got to call the ambulance for the little

176
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,759
baby like what if a ambulance actually

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,520
came for the little crying

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
babies okay unpopular

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
opinion when people kick the back of

180
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,960

305
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,959
an X game it's like the BMX and like

306
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,639
snowboarding like I can just picture

307
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:09,560
Matt being like can you

308
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,920

[ __ ] stupid now sounds like you have

310
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,079
a

311
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,399
moraca me if I ever [ __ ] your

312
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,320
[ __ ] like

313
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,720
what what are you talking about I had to

314
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,360
say something to break the ice you guys

315
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
been [ __ ] yapping and yelling at each

316
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,480
other I had to say something out of

317
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,959
pocket so I could regain focus and

318
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,959
Consciousness to

319
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,920
the the last thing I said was I find it

320
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,760
corny when people actually use their car

321
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,760
horn but I don't think no cuz I I

322
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,320
understand using your car horn if like a

323
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,519
car is coming at you from the wrong side

324
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,120
of the road at hundreds of miles per

325
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,880
hour but it's like if you're like

326
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,200
Loosely at a red light and the person's

327
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,160
not paying attention a little toot toot

328
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,000
is good we don't need to hear it sound

329
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,160
like a [ __ ] 90 car pile up Inferno is

330
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
about to happen in front of my ass we're

331
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,200
chill with the Casual like beep beep

332
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
like oh hey you need to like there's a

333
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,519
difference between a casual alert with

334
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,920
your horn and then acting as if you're

335
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,600
about to be in a [ __ ] 90 car

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,240
Massacre I fully agree my biggest fear I

337
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,240
think would be once once I learn to

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,959
drive if the gods ever align for me to

339
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,680
do so and if someone if I laid on the

340
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,800
horn in front of someone and they got

341
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,880
out of their

342
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,720
car yeah that girl in like that um that

343
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,399

take for all of them to take their

447
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,560
jacket off it was like 35 minutes or

448
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,160
something the wife never took her jacket

like when you go out to eat with friends

458
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,480

459
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,319
that occupies the whole dinner like the

460
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,240
whole dinner we ate our food and we're

461
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,839
just solely focused if these people were

462
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,360
going to take their [ __ ] sweaty

463
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,120

466
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,399
to just get her a cuple I'm good at not

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,559
staring in public cuz it's rude at one

468
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,280
point I caught myself like

469
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,600
this I was looking at them in such

470
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,839
discomfort for myself like I you ever

471
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,400
look at somebody and you get hot yeah

472
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,160
for sure like that was going on too I

473
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,559
was I was and it's like dude I'm a huge

474
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
like I get nervous when I eat I like

475
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,319
this might be like a personal thing that

476
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,039
I'm just like oversharing right now what

477
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,319
no go ahead you feel I said speaking of

478
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,959
being nervous when you eat do you

479
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,600
remember when I pet that dog that was

480
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:35,280
eating at a party attacked me that must

481
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,880
have been terrified what was his name

482
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,480
Pedro oh when I eat like it's not like a

483
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,360
nervous like I'm scared e just like

484
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,600
You're vulnerable no it's not like it's

485
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,480
not that it's like when I do eat like

486
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
because I'm fueling my body and like my

487
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,679
heart's beating and like I'm like eating

488
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,000
food and like drinking Waters like I get

489
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
nervous that I'm going to like go into

490
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,440
like a [ __ ] heart attack when I eat

491
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,960
like [ __ ] like that like I just like I

492
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,559

just get in my head and [ __ ] but what

495
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,240
the [ __ ] was like what was the point of

496
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,400

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,640
about me like if it's like 90° out and

500
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,320
