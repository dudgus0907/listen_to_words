34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,040
to just Tire you out until did I have

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,640
earrings in I don't

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,320
know wo we look like an Oreo our hair

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,719
like if we go like this it's like an

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Oreo so Chris and Matt just fought over

39
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,840
a sock mhm or dueled and then I was like

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,759
Hey children doing that would be pretty

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,119
chaotic so then I was like oh wow we're

42
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,079
triplets like let's Google what it's

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,000
like to raise triplets so now we're

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,640
going to sit here and talk about that I

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,720
Googled how to raise triplets cuz that's

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,920
such a a broad question with no specific

47
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,040
answer so like let's see it is crazy

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,400
that like once the child I wonder if Mom

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,200
ever Googled that once the child's born

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,400
was Google around when mom was born uh

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,160
no not born not born but when we were

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,040
born I don't know go no was it anyways

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,160
statistics refer to the refer to them by

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,840
name rather than as the twins or the

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,319
triplets I so true I agree I'm happy

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,120
they put that first they know it

57
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
literally says like to be and when you

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,800
look up how to raise triplets the first

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,120
thing in bold is here are some ways to

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,120
support each child's individuality cuz

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
that's really all it is MHM like the

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,239
most important part I feel like is like

63
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,040
making sure that all the kids feel

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,680
individual refer to them by name rather

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,120
than as the twins or tripl it's avoid

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,360
dressing them alike as they get older

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
like it is cute when you're like three

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,159
and under like the matching little

69
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,040
onesies yeah I will say Mom and Dad

70
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,599
we've talked about this before but they

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,280
definitely just let us do whatever the

72
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,879
[ __ ] we wanted like dude I went to a I

73

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,000

152
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,840
it was a crazy movie um this video is

153
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,160
kind of short and sweet and we kept it

154
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,039
simple because we like honestly I hate

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,479
vlogging on our birthday because I just

156
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,599
want to spend the time with the people

157
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
that I'm with and enjoy it so we went to

158
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,960
an escape room today and like that's

159
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,280
another thing that sucks is like we keep

160
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,360
going but we can't Vlog them cuz you're

161
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,000

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,160

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,639

know like I like to like live in the

174
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,759
moment soak it in like a big sponge and

175
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,879
it's dude it's so weird to me that we're

176
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,879
20 because I feel

177
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,639
mentally like an adult wise I feel like

178
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,599
responsibility wise like actually as an

179
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,919
adult I feel like 40 but like

180
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,240
youthfulness wise and me I feel like I'm

181
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,440
like like 14 like actually 15 I think

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,759
that this year I know we have a podcast

can't I I think that like mentally

238
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,240
turning 20 years old is like it's

239
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,399
obviously an emotional thing cuz it's

240
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,160
like oh my God you're not really a

241
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,640
teenager anymore but it's like I don't I

242
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,519
haven't really had that feeling yet cuz

243
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,800
it's like I I feel like there's no rush

244
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,800
into

245
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,600

now no like my Instagram ction is so

247
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,120
real cuz it's like getting old is

248
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,000
something I don't want to do but living

249
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,160
