you know little kids are like made of

414
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,799

415
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,760
little kidre how little kids physically

416
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,559
feel after like a tumble or something is

417
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,360
solely off of other people's reaction

418
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,679
yeah like if you go oh they're going to

419
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,280
cry for years but if you're like you're

420
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,760
fine they could be gushing blood out of

421
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,480
their head and they will fully just c

422
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,240
yeah like if a baby gets you could punch

423
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,200
a baby like a you're good

424
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,000
like like you second cry especially when

425
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,440
like a baby falls and kind of like face

426
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,919
plants and they're still okay everyone

427
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,480
around

428
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,039
like and then the baby's

429
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,919
like every single person looked at the

430
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,640
baby so he you have to assume the baby's

431
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,039
a okay until you until you further you

432
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,840

433
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,159

434
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,679

435
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,840

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,360
like is invested when he asks gives him

477
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,039
Absol zero he makes him seem like he

478
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,440
wants to listen but then he just doesn't

479
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,880
do that

480
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,320
exactly hey is a highlight yeah really

481
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,559
wow yeah this was the only one they had

482
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,520
in all right that's enough that's enough

483
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,000
thanks you Mt I feel like we just share

484
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,960
like if you get ripped up by someone you

485
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
rip them back up that's how we sure go

486
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,440
ahead

487
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,400
the one of Matts is he sleeps with a

488
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,240
stuffed animal that's that's not the red

489
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,120
flag though the red flag is that the

490
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,360
stuffed animal has severe privileges

491
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,799
over the spot on his bed and the rules

492
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,320
of the bed so if you sit in the bed but

493
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,039
the stuffed animal Falls you have to

494
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
like pick him up apologize put him back

495
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,960
if you want to lay on the left side with

496
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,039
his stuffed animals there Mr puckington

497
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,200
has to tell you oh Mr wrinkles has to

498
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,840
tell you whether or not you're allowed

499
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,480
to sit there so the red flag is not the

500
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,679
stuffed animal itself it's the fact that

501
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,120
the S animal is literally a tyrant of

502
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:07,600
the B that's the problem that was great

503
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,320
okay I have I have one combo one though

504
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,360

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,279
the brand and then you're asking

507
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,480
questions like that are ridiculous like

508
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,720

516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,600
critical thinking skills and I go to the

517
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,760
living room where the Wi-Fi router is

518
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,120
and Chris unplugged it so I plug it back

519
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,840
in and I'm like oh maybe that's the

520
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,559

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,880
before watching stranger things did you

1060
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,559

and Dragons no but there's like a

1062
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:35,800
storyline a plot character it really

1063
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,040
really really think about it it has to

1064
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,040
do with Dungeons and Dragons but it

1065
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,839
really minimally like relates it's a

1066
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,200
whole did you play Dungeons and Dragons

1067
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,640

called Plymouth obviously the pilgrims

1076
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,680

00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,800
go to Plymouth first they both start

1078
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,839
with a pee oh my God I love Cape C

1079
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,319

that's like why no the Plymouth

1081
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,800
Plantation that thing beat when we used

to go to Plymouth Plantation with like

1083
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,079
our school and it was like in Plymouth

like I'd go in and talk to the lady and

1090

1100
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,920
living in Plymouth Plantation I just

1101
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,800

1248
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,119

1249
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:07,720
clothing like underwear or socks I'm

1250
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,400

1251
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,160
them

1252
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Smalling theming making

1253
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,760
them shut the [ __ ] up making them

1254
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,880
smaller every time they wear it so like

1255
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,720
they wear socks and like would you put

1256
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,359
them in the laundry like say like you're

1257
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,640
in the perfect Ro to do

1258
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:27,359
this like no don't even shrink them but

1259
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,000
it it'll fully replace them with like a

1260
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,240
size down so like if the underwear is

1261
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
like an extra large buy them large and

1262
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,599
then just replace it oh here you go and

1263
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,760
like but scrape off the L so they can't

1264
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,400
tell and then they wear it again oh it

1265
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,200
was a little tighter that time replace

1266
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,920
it with a medium and then by the they're

1267
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,480
going to get to like all their clothes

1268
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,040

1269
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,559
better every time they wear it like that

1710
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:33,360
problem was not that it did not lie all

1711
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:35,840
the way flat the problem was it was

1712
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,400
positioned if I was a [ __ ]

1713
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,520
contortionist like the back was arched

1714
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,960
the feet were up I felt like a kangaroo

1715
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,679
on the Frogger you know what I'm talking

1716
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,920
about the ride that goes up and down I

1717
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,120
felt like I was at Star blast at canaby

1718
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,600
Lake it was Unreal I was like what

1719
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,800
coaster did I just get on I felt like

1720
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,920
they put me up like like I've never had

1721
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,600
this happen to me cuz I'm I don't have

1722
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,280
female genitalia but like when you're

1723
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,600
giving birth like your feet are up on

1724
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,600
things so that they can get a good look

1725
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,760
for the delivery I felt like I was just

1726
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:08,840
up in the air like weirdest position

1727
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:12,960
I've ever been in in my life for five

1728
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,440
[ __ ] hours and then I tried to like

1729
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,280
lay it down and the problem was that the

1730
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,360
thing didn't go flat it was just like

1731
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,840
stuck in that position and then I'm like

1732
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,840
okay like whatever RuPaul will get me

1733
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,760
through this so I go I go to my TV show

1734
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,360
and it's like oh not loading and then my

1735
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,320
Wi-Fi did not work for the rest of the

1736
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,480
flight I'm like what songs do I have

1737
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,400
downloaded I'll just listen to my

1738
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:35,320
downloaded music and try and sleep as if

1739
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:38,520
I'm [ __ ] delivering a child and I hit

1740
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:42,159
Shuffle on my music silence the whole

1741
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:46,080
plan silence silence so I spent the

1742
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:47,800
whole flight sitting there in despair no

1743
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,719
music we literally gave you I give you

1744
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:53,120
I'll give you a a little cheat right now

1745
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,120
you ready you can ask for a shuffle and

1746
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,320
I'll pick one of another two words that

1747
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,760
I have except one of them is more

1748
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,639
difficult and one of them is easier but

1749
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,880
I'll rock paper scissors Nick for harder

1750
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:03,199
or easier words I don't know what you

1751
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,280
should have said okay it's like a

1752
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,639
shuffle like do you want to

1753
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,960
take okay

1754
01:14:08,639 --> 01:14:14,159
minuscule sounds like mini

1755
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,639
stool okay perfect can you say it in a

1756
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,760
sentence the amount of water they had

1757
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:20,840
was

1758
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:24,760
minuscule where I don't know bad example

1759
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:27,719
bad example whatever Nick can you get

1760
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:30,280
Nick I want Nick's example this should

1761
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:32,679
be taking a minuscule amount of time but

1762
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,600
it is taking you far longer for no

oh my God can you talk about this the

1783
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:48,560
story there the lady cutting your

1784
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:50,239
hair okay I don't remember it at all she

1785
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,639
said that she was like this Brazilian

1786
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:56,040
lady oh my God no it was this woman the

1787
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:59,360
woman who cut my hair there like I try

1788
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:01,520
to be like I'm all for women I love them

1789
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,440
this woman

1790
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,159
had breast implants for sure not that

1791
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,600
this is like a bad thing it's just

1792
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,000
critical to the story so that's why I'm

1793
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,320
bringing it up but usually I wouldn't

1794
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,560
talk about a woman's breast but it has

1795
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:16,719
to go to story so I have to bring it up

1796
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:19,400
but because she had breast implants her

1797
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:22,600
boobs were obviously huge so she was

1798
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:24,239
cutting my hair she was cutting my hair

1799
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,880
and as was cutting my hair she was

1800
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:28,239
getting so close to me while cutting my

1801
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,239
hair that like her boobs were like

1802
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,080
resting on my neck and back and

1803
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:34,320
shoulders and head and like she just

1804
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:37,199
kept going around me cutting parts of my

1805
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,920
hair and I'm just like I'm happy I was

1806
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:42,480
like gay because otherwise like like I

1807
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,360
was just scared cuz I'm like if I was

1808
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,360
anyone else I'd feel very violated like

1809
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:48,239
I was very comfortable but her boobs

1810
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,679
were everywhere around me like my back

1811
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,920
my shoulder like if you're if you're a

1812
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,239

1813
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,880
impression no absolutely like I'm just

1814
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:56,480
like like it was I just tried to forget

1815
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,560
it and that's why it took me so long to

1816
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,760
remember that cuz I was so like just in

1817
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,440

down that are just like goofy um my

1972
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:09,199
least favorite words when people are

1973
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:11,080
like oh it's ethereal or eal like [ __ ]

1974
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:13,120
shut the [ __ ] up what does that mean

1975
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:16,600
shut up what does that mean it's like oh

1976
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:18,400
like like I look e ethereal or eal like

1977
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,159
they think they're like a fairy princess

1978
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,800
it's like you look uh a little a little

1979
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:27,040
better than mid

1980
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:30,800
ethereal ethereal ain't the word to use

1981
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:34,760
like at all oh my

1982
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,840
God I just hate that word my God I hate

1983
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:40,960
that word that was the best that was the

1984
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:43,840
most you've ever flamed like something I

1985
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:47,800
was that he said you look a smidge

1986
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,679
better than mid oh I love that word smid

1987
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,120
thank

1988
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:52,600
you no but it is true I really just

1989
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,600
don't think that that word's ever

1990
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,520
suitable for like a human being is that

1991
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:59,400
a real word let's Google it that word is

1992
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,719
good to use if you enter Narnia you can

1993
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,320
be like oh this place

1994
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:06,199
if if you're living out of fable then go

1995
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:07,920
for it but you're it is extremely

1996
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:10,040
delicate and light in a way that seems

1997
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,560
too perfect for this

1998
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:14,199
world what and if you're if you're

1999
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,320
calling yourself that you're a God

2000
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:19,520
you're goofy you're goofy you're so

2001
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:21,960
goofy I feel like youd do that though

2002
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,880
that was that was so that's like even

2003
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,719
like like only way I would use that is

2004
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,840
if I was

2005
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:30,880
like I wouldn't use it yeah maybe

2006
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,719
entering Narnia or like visiting

2007
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,800
Tinkerbell but those are like seem to be

2008
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,639
the only two occasions also another

2009
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,360

2312
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:25,560
to Yo Diamond's blinging okay

2313
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:28,480

10 in like eth grade seventh e8th grade

2322
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:52,679

2640
01:52:38,679 --> 01:52:42,800
