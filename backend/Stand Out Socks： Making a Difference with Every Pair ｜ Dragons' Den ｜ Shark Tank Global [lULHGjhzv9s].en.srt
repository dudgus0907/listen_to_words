1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Afternoon,

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,160
dragons.

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,040
My name's Christian.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
What's

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
Hi, my name is Natalie.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
And together we are

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
Stand Out.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,680
And we're here today to pitch for

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,840
£30,000 for 25% equity in our company,

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,640
Standout Enterprises Limited.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,080
In the UK, there's approximately 1.5

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
million adults with a learning

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,239
disability. Now, as it stands today,

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,719
there is little as 5.1% of adults with a

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
learning disability in England known to

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
be in paid employment.

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
Unfortunately, my little brother here,

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
Ross, was part of that statistic.

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,120
Frustrated at that fact, myself, Ross,

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,800
and Natalie got together and thought,

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,399
why don't we create a job for him? And

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,039
that was the day Standout Socks was

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,520
born. Our mission for Standout is to

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,239
become the leading employer for people

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
with learning disabilities in the UK.

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,359
Thank you very much for listening. I'm

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
going to pass you over to Ross now who's

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
going to hand you all a sample. I hope

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
we hope you really enjoy it. Thank you.

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,000
A business with the purpose of providing

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
jobs to people with learning

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,080
disabilities.

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
My eye

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,400
is the brainchild of brothers Ross and

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,400
Christian Lane and Natalie Dixon.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,479
Spot on.

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,119
Thank you. M pay for it.

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,439
They're seeking £30,000 in exchange for

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,880
25% of their sock making company.

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,680
Who's your favorite guy? My favorite

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,640
girl.

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,439
All of you.

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
Diplomatic catastrophe narrowly avoided.

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,799
Thank you, sir.

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,200
Steven Bartlett is first to kick off

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,200
with the questions.

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,680
They're like Manchester United colors.

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,520
So they they were sold in the Manchester

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,479
United mega store.

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
Who do you support?

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
Manchester United.

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840
I've now got the best socks in the den.

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
It looks good.

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,280
Um the most compelling thing you said

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,360
when we're thinking about the story here

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,200
was giving people jobs who have kind of

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,920
been left out of the workforce to some

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
degree. Yeah.

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,520
Can you speak from your experience about

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,800
how transformative that is as a value

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
proposition or a value ad to the

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,760
individuals that are getting jobs

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,760
because of Standout?

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
Yeah. So, for example, Stand Out was

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
born out of COVID really. Ross moved in

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,879
with my mom and dad

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
um and was shielded um for pretty much

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,120
12 months back after that.

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,959
Now, Ross struggled with after all that

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,879
time away. He struggled with social

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
skills. Is that all right for me to say?

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah,

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
sure. Uh confidence

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
always.

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah.

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,519
You don't strike as someone lacking in

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,599
confidence. Ross,

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,400
you got bit of confidence.

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,480
And then just giving anybody the value

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,879
of having a job and and the purpose to

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,720
go and do something is good for anybody,

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,720
not just somebody with a learning

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,720
disability.

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
So, how long has the business been

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
going?

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,920
So, we now just finished year one at the

87
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,680
end of January and we're now in year

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
two. So, what was your full year's

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
trading on that first year?

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,159
So, our first year's trading, we turned

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,159
over um £36,158.

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:28,760
We had a gross profit of 22,245

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,760
with a pre-tax profit of £5,186.

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,400
Someone spent a lot of time learning

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
them figures to the pound right there.

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
Oh, well done, Natalie. And are you

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,959
fulltime on this, Ross?

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
is together is Tuesday

99
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,959
on a Tuesday. So on a Tuesday and a

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,200
Sunday we we do like

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
videos for our social medias and post

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
our social medias and then Ross will

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,400
pack all the socks.

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,599
Oh, so you're the social media superstar

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,599
Ross

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,760
as well as Chief Packer.

107
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
I love it.

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
Do

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,280
you know what? It's really interesting

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
because I must admit, as you can tell, I

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,840
love socks.

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,239
But is this and can this be a business

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
or could anybody do this? I mean the

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
answer for me is that anybody could

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,919
could do this. So I need to find what

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,560
your real unique selling point is that

117
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,360
as a consumer when I'm buying this I

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,840
know. So for example there are very very

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
famous sock business in the states and

120
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,520
their whole premise was that if you buy

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,360
one pair of socks another pair of socks

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,759
goes to somebody that's homeless. Yeah.

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Yeah.

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,199
I want to know what's your unique

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
message and how do you get it across?

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,320
So our our unique selling point is we we

127
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,680
we're using the socks to create

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,080
conversations around disability

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
inclusion and down syndrome awareness.

130
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,880
But looking at that, I wouldn't say

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,320
that.

132
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,759
That's my point. So I want you to tell

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,560
me how are you doing this?

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,120
So Standout, the brand Standout will be

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,919
known as an employer of people with

136
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
learning disabilities.

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
Brilliant. Now tell me about that

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,000
because that's what I'm interested in.

139
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,800
How are you going to do that? So we've

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,120
been working with a national um charity

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,919
and then as we build through from there

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
our our main ethos is to give people

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,199
like

144
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,840
above who have struggled to get work.

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,360
Jobs.

146
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
Jobs.

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Right. Okay. And how are you going to

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
get there so that I know about it?

149
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,919
So imagine you're every retailer.

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
Yeah.

151
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,160
What one strap line would you give this

152
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,800
business that when I'm walking past that

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,960
end aisle, I'm going I'm going to buy

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,960
those socks.

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
So

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
by these socks, help us change the

157
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,080
world.

158
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,080
One pair of socks does what?

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,479
Makes a makes a a ripple.

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,080
Makes a ripple in the the world,

161
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,039
you know. It's

162
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
No, no. I I appreciate

163
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you getting what I'm saying?

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Yeah. Yeah. I I I I appreciate what

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
you're saying.

166
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,039
This is a brutal world to make money in

167
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
business and I don't believe you're

168
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,000
going to get there unless you're

169
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
absolutely laserike focused in how

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,440
you're going to get there and how you

171
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,240
are going to do exactly what your brand

172
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,600
says, which is to stand out.

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Why stand out, not stand up?

174
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,919
Stand up kind of feels a lot more about

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
what you're doing. You're standing up

176
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,479
for people. You're you're including

177
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
people into So So did you think about

178
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
those choices?

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes, sure. We we thought, well, why fit

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
in when you're born to stand out? Why?

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,840
It's not telling your story,

182
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,680
right? So, for us, it's it it's hard to

183
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
get across. It's just like, don't don't

184
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,919
hide in the background. Stand out. Be

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,039
Natalie, that's the problem.

186
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,759
It's hard to tell your story.

187
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:53,280
But I sit here looking as an investor.

188
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,440
And I think there's a lot an awful lot

189
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,240
that needs to be done to tell your

190
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,319
particular story. And that does make it

191
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
hard for an investor.

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:07,319
So, I'm really sorry, guys. And I mean

193
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,319
that. I won't be investing. I won't.

194
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
Christian Ross Natalie.

195
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,199
Yay.

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,560
How big can

197
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,160
these socks get? And I'm not talking

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
like extra large, extra large. I mean

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
like how big can this business be?

200
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,560
We It's going to get massive because

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,479
we want to become a global leader. want

202
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,039
to become a so we want stores in each

203
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,840
capital city and people to you know help

204
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,919
people not just in the UK but worldwide

205
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,800
to get there cuz obviously socks are

206
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
quite

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
I'd say quite easy to make these are

208
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
very good quality but obviously the

209
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
thing that's going to help you penetrate

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
such a saturated market is an

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,800
impenetrable mission and it's really

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,280
telling the story of the mission here

213
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,240
um

214
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,639
and I know how to tell a good story

215
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,280
so I'm going to make you an offer

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,800
back in me.

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
I love the business. The very core of

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
this business is allowing people to have

219
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
opportunities who wouldn't otherwise

220
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,360
have opportunities. That's the bit that

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,639
got me. So my offer is going to be for

222
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,240
all of the money

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,599
for 25% of the business.

224
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,280
And listen, we'll go to Manchester

225
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
United together.

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,639
Why are you wearing city colors? Why are

227
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
you wearing city colors? Miss

228
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,080
didn't

229
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,479
think of that.

230
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,479
Wow. Okay,

231
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
guys. I want to know what you want a

232
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,599
dragon for.

233
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,479
Yeah. Watch

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
dancing.

235
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,120
Ross wants someone from to come dancing.

236
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
You want someone to dance with? I'd be

237
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
perfect. Ross,

238
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,279
may I?

239
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,279
talking.

240
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,080
The first time I've had that answer.

241
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,360
Excellent. It's looking promising here.

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,279
How about you, Natalie?

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah. So, obviously we we've got we've

244
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
got a really varied skill set between

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
us, but there are some gaps where we

246
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
could just do with a a kind of helping

247
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,880
hand along the way.

248
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
And the big thing I've heard that you

249
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
need help with in a big way is

250
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
storytelling.

251
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
Yeah.

252
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
And I would say the the unique skill

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
that I have in my business is

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
storytelling.

255
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,560
So, I'm going to take Bartlett on.

256
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,519
Good luck.

257
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,080
So, I'm going to match his offer and I

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,040
would also give you all of the money for

259
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,040
25% of the business.

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,279
And I've got something he hasn't got.

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm a way better dancer.

262
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,680
I'll be shove.

263
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,880
[Music]

264
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,760
Look, you've got two great offers.

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,399
individual offers,

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,240
but maybe there's another offer because

267
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,920
I because I think that you might need

268
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,600
more than one dragon on this.

269
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,640
Open door. It's all about opening doors

270
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,120
here.

271
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,640
[Music]

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,959
So, my offer really is is very simple is

273
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,440
I would offer you half the money for 12%

274
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
if the dragons wanted to do it cuz I

275
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
think I think it needs more than one

276
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
dragon here.

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
Thank you.

278
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah, I think that's a nice offer. You

279
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,839
can tell you can you can see the

280
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
situation here, can't you? It's it's a

281
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,240
tough one.

282
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,839
No, no, I would push it.

283
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,279
I really wanted to push you today as

284
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,720
hard as I could to try and get this

285
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
answer to this question, though.

286
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
Mhm.

287
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
Because I don't believe that you're

288
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,320
going to have a chance in hell of making

289
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
this a successful business until you get

290
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
that right.

291
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,760
Okay.

292
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,240
And that's why I think I'm the right

293
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,240
partner for you.

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,680
So, I'm going to make you an offer for

295
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,680
all of the money um for 20%.

296
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,560
The old undercut.

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
Okay. Should we go in?

298
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
You can speak to them all.

299
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
Thank you guys. Thank you.

300
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,800
Thank you very much.

301
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,800
Peter Jones with the undercut.

302
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
A plethora of offers for the

303
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,079
entrepreneurial philanthropists. All

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,560
right, going to do now.

305
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,560
Steven Bartlett and Sar Davies have

306
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,440
agreed to pay the asking price of

307
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
£30,000 for 25%.

308
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,360
Got a choice.

309
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Steven

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,200
Tuka Sullyman has offered to team up

311
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,160
with another dragon at the same

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
valuation.

313
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,880
I really don't know what to do. What do

314
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,079
you think? do this now.

315
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,839
But sock supreo Peter Jones has undercut

316
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:42,079
them all with a pledge of 20%.

317
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:46,760
Let's do this. Let's stand out. Come on.

318
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,760
Who will they pick to pair up with?

319
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
Okay. Um,

320
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
obviously thank you very much for all

321
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,320
your input. We really, really appreciate

322
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
it. But we wondered

323
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
guys

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,020
if you two can could work together on

325
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,360
this.

326
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:11,360
[Music]

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,800
I have to say um Peter is the only

328
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,279
dragon that's ever spoken to me about

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,880
socks. Literally sat in this chair over

330
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,360
maybe a bit too much.

331
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,120
So if we do at the 25% level then I'm

332
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm happy to partner if Peter is

333
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
Wow. Oh, I think that's that'll be for

334
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,160
me. That I think that's that will be

335
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
amazing.

336
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
Ross, what you think?

337
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,399
Do this.

338
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,399
I'd like to do it. Let's do it.

339
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
Success for Ross and his team as they

340
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,200
secure the backing they came for, which

341
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,279
will undoubtedly turbocharge their

342
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
business and their cause.

343
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,320
Well done. Well done.

344
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,440
What about me dance? Go on then.

345
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
Yeah.

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
Do you know how you do it around here?

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah.

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,760
Yeah.

349
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,040
One, two, three. One, two, three. Yeah,

350
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,040
good. And a spa.

351
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
Oh, he's sipping the pel. I like it.

352
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
You're a good sir.

353
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,959
Yeah. Thank you very much, honestly. We

354
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,959
really appreciate it.

355
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,160
Brilliant.

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,160
Ecstatic. and shock.

357
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,680
Yeah, it was uh it was it was

358
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,480
unbelievable to get four offers for

359
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,480
starters. That was amazing.

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh, it was so brilliant. I actually

361
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
think it could be a really really great

362
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
business

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
with the right story.

364
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,680
That's the thing we got to work on is

365
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
get that messaging that

366
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
it's not there yet, but we'll we'll make

367
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,720
that happen.

368
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,720
We did it, guys.
