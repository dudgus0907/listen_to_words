[Music]

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,360
literally nothing literally it's sensing

107
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,440
cars Casper or spazzing out for no

108
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,860
reason

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,040
okay time to open my [ __ ]

110
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,300
amulet price this cost I almost [ __ ]

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,759
I'm surprised they didn't make me fight

112
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Captain Hook to get it

113
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,320
if you Google best ways to relax just

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,479
stepping away from something

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,120
stressful for a few minutes or taking

116
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,979
time away from your normal routine and

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,860
thoughts can give you enough space and

118
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,199
distance to feel calmer read a book or a

119
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,080
magazine hold on even if it's only for a

120
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,320
few minutes run yourself a bath watch a

121
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,820
film play with a pet and try out a new

122
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,580
recipe

123
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,820
all right I know exactly what we should

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,900
do take a bath together no I was pretty

125
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,940
sure we do

126
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,160
I don't know maybe we popcorn read a

127
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,020
book absolutely I feel like reading is

128
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,419
gonna stress me out more

129
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,180
try a new recipe that's also a little

130
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:06,240
stressful it's like a daunting task I

131
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,000
don't know daunting that was insane just

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,259
slip away from something stressful

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,820
I think Nick should just go downstairs

134
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,220
for a little bit

135
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,740
I just stepped away from him bold same

136
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,039
joke just different ways to do it yep

137
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,020

together oh my God Nick looks scary no

172
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,099
one of the main relaxing things was like

173
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,199
calm yourself in some nice toasty water

174
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,580

175
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,620
was best or get naked in my bath

176
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,780
together and this was a much better

177
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,199
second option

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,720
themselves first so I was happy that

226
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,160
we're still able to make a video even

227
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,760
though we're all really feeling pretty

228
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,980
terribly but you know it happens and

229
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,720
we're gonna move forward regardless yep

230
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,920
I know I know we say it every week but

231
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,959
we actually have a lot of stuff we've

232
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,640
been working on so hopefully a lot of

233
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,100
new stuff coming soon

234
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,380

235
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,120

239
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,339
because it's actually soon okay

240
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,920

241
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,019
says from here on to the Future

242
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,940
I think he's on your left he's on your

243
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,320
left according to the gun

244
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,320
and then it's Huron

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,339

246
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,339
