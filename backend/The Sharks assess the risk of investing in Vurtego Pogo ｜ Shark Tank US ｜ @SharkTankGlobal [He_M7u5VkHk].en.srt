1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,120
Next into the tank is Brian Spencer, who

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:10,160
believes his product can be the next big

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,639
trend in action sports. That is so cool.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,719
Wow.

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,200
Hello.

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,200
Oh my god.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Dang. Wow.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,080
Wow. Way to go, guys. Wow. Wow. That was

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,720
awesome. Hey guys, my name is Brian

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,280
Spencer. I'm the founder and chief test

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,880
pilot for Vertigo Pogo Sticks. And what

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,160
we're looking for is a half a million

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,680
dollars for 20% of the

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,920
company. All these kids and adults that

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,200
participate in things like BMX and and

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,640
motocross and stuff like that, they're

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
always looking for the next big thing,

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,920
the next sort of evolution of action

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
sports. This could be that thing. We're

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
going to show you a video right here of

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
some of the stuff kids are doing around

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,000
the world already. By the way, don't try

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,280
this at home. Uh, it's not something

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,879
that you should do unless you're

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,199
professionals like these guys. Let's

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,199
take a look.

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,799
Oh,

28
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,640
cool. Oh, that is so cool. Essentially,

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,320
what we've done is reinvented the pogo

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,880
stick. How many have you sold? Uh, we've

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,560
sold about 7,000. Nobody's injured

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840
themselves. Hey, you know, skateboards,

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,840
people get hurt on skateboards. These

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
are uh deceptively safe. And I say that

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
because um you're not dealing with

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,200
speed. You're dealing with just going up

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,799
and down.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
And what's the typical retail price?

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,680
$330. What's it cost to make it? Cost

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
about 100 bucks. Obviously, there's

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
other pogo sticks. There is a competitor

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
that uses rubber bands. The biggest pogo

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
stick company in the world, by the way.

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
They sell millions of pogo sticks every

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
year. We plan on replacing them as the

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,439
world's largest pogo stick manufacturer.

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
Is this a mass market product or could

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,920
you continue doing what you're doing,

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
selling three to 400,000 a year, but

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,759
making specialized more expens? Cuz

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,079
honestly, when you told me it was only

52
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,920
$300 as a specialty product, that seemed

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
cheap to me. The same reason why most

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
kids don't buy a $5,000 mountain bike,

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
you know, their parents buy them a $500

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,319
BMX bike. Um, in order to make money

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
with this, we do have to approach the

58
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,080
masses.

59
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,280
Why don't you stay in that space, own

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,879
it, make fantastic margins, and build

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,879
them in California and be happy with

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,040
that. I mean, a strategy where you want

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,640
to go compete and sell at toy stores and

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
have mass distribution is a completely

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,239
different business. Look, I'll just tell

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,200
you, you can be a victim of your own

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,360
success. I mean, when you're cool and

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
hip, I bring you down to a Mavs game. We

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
already are cool and hip, right? See,

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,519
that's the point. When you go mass

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,440
market, you lose a little bit of that.

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
to be able to maintain your coolness and

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,720
segregate into an entire different type

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,640
of company that goes mass market and to

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,120
do it with, you know, $500,000 only.

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,560
That's not an easy task.

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Listen, you got billions of dollars of

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
investors on this side of these tables.

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Everybody's in sync on the same place.

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,959
They don't see your vision for the low

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,680
end. What's the matter with you? As I'm

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,200
listening to you guys, uh I I I agree. I

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,319
It's hard not to agree. I'll tell you

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,560
what I want to see. I want to see the

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
price of these things go up by 100% by

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,599
$600. I keep telling people that and

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
people say, "No, you got to go mass

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,879
market, but I'm It's nothing short of a

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,319
miracle that some kid didn't get killed

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
on this already." Now, maybe I'm a

91
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,800
protective mom. Granted, I am. Well, if

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,800
it's not mother approved, that's good

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,879
for us.

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,959
I'm out.

95
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
Here's here's where I'm at. Once you

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,959
bring one of us in, especially this guy,

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,879
right? Then all of a sudden, it's not

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
about cool. It's not about anything

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,640
else. It's about cash. Well, coming to

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,239
the sharks, I was expecting, you know,

101
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,440
um for the mentality to be more mass

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,200
market. We got to sell a ton of these

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
things and make a million bucks. Even

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,920
worse, that's even worse. Be you. When

105
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,400
you try to please everybody, you end up

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,560
pleasing

107
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,239
nobody. That's why I'm out, right? I

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
don't want to crush the pogo guys. I

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,680
just want to make money. You should get

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,040
out there, bring out the boost at

111
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,159
$1,200. Every kid and his dog is going

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
to want one. They're going to figure out

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,480
how to sell their sister to buy it. and

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
you're going to make an obscene profit,

115
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
but I'm not going to give you $500,000.

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
I'm out.

117
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,319
I have to sound like the rest of the

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
guys. The product is great. You're doing

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,840
sales. You don't need us.

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,759
I'm out. Okay, Brian, you're the

121
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
ultimate and cool. Cool product. Your

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,440
hair is cool. You got the whole look.

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Everybody's right. The minute you try to

124
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
go mass market, it's a guy in a suit

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
selling in Wall Street. I wish I was

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,560
involved in some way, but I'm out.

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
Can I buy that one before you go today?

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
Sure. Make you a special deal. 1,200

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
bucks. Yeah.

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
You're a shark. All right, Brian. All

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,199
right, Brian. Appreciate it, buddy. Good

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
luck with everything. Well, the Sharks

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
didn't give me a deal, but they gave me

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,400
some great advice. I love what they told

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,720
me about, you know, maintaining that

136
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,720
position as the creme de la creme in the

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
industry.
