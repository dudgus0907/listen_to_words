20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,399

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,160
scenarios that just like my first

24
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,399
initial thought while someone's talking

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,520

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,480

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,600
seeing myself turn into Ash and fall to

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,039
the ground and just dissipate into the

29
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,640
air that the other day Nick said and I

30
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,560

595
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,320

596
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,640
faces you feel pinned to the [ __ ]

597
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,679
mattress I like it hold

598
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,080
on you wake up and you know that your

599
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,799
brain is awake and you physically cannot

600
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,080
move your body yet and it just feels

601
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,240
like you're being pushed that's how it

602
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,600
literally felt I feel like I'm at the

603
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,600
fourth grade science I I was going to

604
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,559
