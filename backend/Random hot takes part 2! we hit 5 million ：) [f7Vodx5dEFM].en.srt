56
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,819
I wasn't in the circus tea if

57
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:39,420
if I wasn't who I was Ferris wheel or

58
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:43,440
something if I wasn't who I was

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,720
I'd think Febreze is a magical word

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,720
I was taking a [ __ ] today and I looked

61
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,640
up and I saw Febreze and I'm like if I

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,599
was not who I was like if I was a little

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,120
kid like you know you can make little

64
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,500
kids believe anything yeah if I watched

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,840
Harry Potter and someone was like oh I

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,879
can't wait for the Febreze like I have

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,800
no prior knowledge of Febreze I'm like

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,739
oh they're gonna [ __ ]

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,840
Febreze that [ __ ]

70
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:09,420
up and like it's such a perfect corner

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,060
for like you're gonna freeze it up

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,519
okay it doesn't sound like a [ __ ] if

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,720
I had a magic one away Febreze what do

74
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,980
you think is gonna happen the air is

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,379
gonna smell better that motherfucker's

76
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,060
gonna stop in his tracks I think it's

77
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,239
closer to freeze and that's why you

78
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,819
think that fabri oh that's true yeah

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,819
would Febreze be an action or a person

80
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,640
definitely in action correct well I feel

81
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,739
like there could be the great Febreze I

82
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,200
completely disagree no I feel like there

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,940
could be a person named Febreze like The

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,140
Fez like the first name and the breeze

85
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,480
like the last name don't say that like

86
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,000
it's a febreze why just embarrassing the

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,680
great Febreze yeah oh my God that is a

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
great I've been dying to tell you guys

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,980
this I saw a video on my for you page

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,260
the other day and this woman was at an

91
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,980
airport like freaking the [ __ ] out and

92
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,900
she spat on a police officer and I

93
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,080
genuinely I saw that and wonder what my

94
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,940
one takeaway was I'd kill her no what I

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,200
think it's someone's spat if someone's

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,420
spit no I was about to say shut up no

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,400
I literally thought my first thought was

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,760
if I ever got spat on

99
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,299
I'd end up in jail I'd be imprisoned in

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,299
30 seconds

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,199
I'd handcuffed myself in a walk to the

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,060
prison I agree because oh my God I would

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,220
spit back at them and then beat the [ __ ]

104
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,160
out of them oh my God it's like

105
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,500
genuinely it makes my toes itch and my

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,080
[ __ ] Nose getting spit on like is the

107
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,979
most disrespectful thing oh right here I

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,979
think that if I got

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,919
someone out faster than [ __ ] Mike

110
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,840
Tyson in the [ __ ] 90s I'd knock

111
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,360
someone and fight in the knife and I

112
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,320
have no idea to knock someone out faster

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,479
than the Bubonic plague bro I oh my God

114
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,860
it it would be like that person's

115
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,960
biggest fear would then be what they had

116
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,940
just done to me give me a great garbanzo

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
please okay let's talk about it because

118
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,800
it's a thing yeah

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,759
people throwing [ __ ] on people at people

120
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,860
on a stage ah ridiculous

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,419
ridiculous I'm just the dumbest [ __ ]

122
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,160
it happened to Bebe rexha and then it

123
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,979
happened to like four more people back

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,080
to back to back I think most people

125
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,419
other than the

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,560
the guy who through something at beer

127
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,240
actually literally said he thought it

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,979
would be funny but most of the time

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,020
people throw [ __ ] with like a a good

130
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,580
intent I disagree no no because they

131
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,199
want like they wanted to like oh like a

132
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,340
stuffed animal or flowers or something

133
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,500
you know what I mean if you're throwing

134
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,840
something with weight to it no if you're

135
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,060
Hocking something that doesn't belong on

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,000
a stage at someone on a stage you need

137
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,039
to be imprisoned why don't I hate what

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,259
when people oh actually I just remember

139
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,160
what I was gonna say if you had to pick

140
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:01,259
one option of item like garbanzo you

141
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,720
could only have anything that could fit

142
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,759
in your hand what item would you pick to

143
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,520
throw in the crowd if you had to hurt

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,020
people I'm not saying like obviously we

145
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,900
don't promote violence so we don't want

146
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,419
to do that in this hypothetical question

147
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,100
if there was a large crowd of people and

148
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,039
you had to injure as many as you can

149
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,560
what okay is the comment and say

150
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,740
something there was a herd of zombies no

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,759
no heard of people like an actual herd

152
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,440
of just okay fine everyone

153
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,259
today thank you for accommodating well

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,740
no I'm gonna switch it up a group of

155
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,500
Rude mean people group of people that

156
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,860
are just bad boys

157
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,560
a group of bad people all right and

158
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,259
you'd put them in a [ __ ] just a large

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,419
crowd and you can throw only one handful

160
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,160
of things what would you throw because I

161
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,960
have two options in my handful of things

162
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,419
is that like it you have to pick

163
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,940
something what's your ideal weapon of

164
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:03,479
eight pound bowling ball that's all bad

165
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,460
bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad pig

166
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,560
really bad pick you're hitting one

167
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,360
person doing a lot of damage and it's

168
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,479
bad you wanna it's like the whole point

169
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
is injure as many as you can Nails

170
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,780
that's a better option that's a better

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,479
option what about you I was gonna say

172
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,500
Nails I was gonna say as many rolls of

173
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,360
quarters that could fail oh my God

174
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,000
yeah a sack of coins no I think even

175
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,319
though

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,120
they all run they'd be stepping or golf

177
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,479
balls okay what would I hate more than

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,580
anything like probably top

179
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,440
10 biggest pet peeves oh that's a lie

180
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,340
it's not top 10 at all but really

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,340
bothers me go ahead

182
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,160
when people

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,099
when people go into other people's space

184
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
and create a mess and don't clean up

185
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,099
after themselves kind of like how you

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,560

265
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,700
usage of that if someone were to say

266
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,320
like oh they're so close just group them

267
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
together like that's us like you just

268
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,380
kind of disrespect it okay what's the

269
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,459
difference between a clementine and a

270
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,959
mandarin

271
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,279

272
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,560
you and Matt I could ask the same

273
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,620
[ __ ] what's in Mandarin though

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,019
isn't that a language Chinese yeah so

275
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,760

276
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,760
what I said Chinese what's the fruit

277
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,260
Mandarin it's doubles bro it's a bat in

278
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,260
the bat no I just thought I was wrong

279
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,620
sometimes I can't believe my [ __ ]

280
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,620
thought just

281
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:38,100
squeeze like what's what would be your

282
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,140
ideal fruit or vegetable to squeeze

283
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,300
I don't think of this ever like if I had

284
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,519
a grapefruit I just like use both hands

285
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,220
and just like pounded down the

286
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,160
grapefruit to its pulp that'd be a fun

287
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,440
one to squeeze

288
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,300
oh my God stop Chris

289
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,100
what would be your ideal fruit to

290
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,600
squeeze I don't know nothing like a

291
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,459
handful of [ __ ] blueberries I don't

292
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,660
know it's a good one do you remember the

293
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,860
book about blueberries when we were

294
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,760
little and like the little bear went to

295
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,760
go eat the blueberries yes

296
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,640
correct didn't he fill it with

297
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,640
blueberries no

298
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,779
all right champion because the duck

299
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,459
walked up to the lemonade what the [ __ ]

300
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,459
am I singing You're the champion

301
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,899
I thought I was wearing a champion shirt

302
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,899
oh

303
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,240
where's this person oh neck sauce is

304
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,100
crazy get the [ __ ] out of here when I'm

305
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,740
really tired of

306
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,320
real added jackets with the Plaid on the

307
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,899
inside and not the outside no

308
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,220
hate them I'm tired of them I don't

309
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,019
actually have any feelings toward that I

310
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,680
think that's kind of fun I don't know

311
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,779
it's like why put this one pattern on

312
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,120
the inside in the outside

313
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,120
yeah it's the last one like why would

314
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,620
you put the most super fun pattern on

315
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
the inside of something because that's

316
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,279
what it's all about unless it's on the

317
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,079
edges I think it's more sentimental and

318
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,180
it really preaches about like getting to

319
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,279
know somebody beyond the outside okay

320
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,200
once they take the jacket off

321
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,820
it's not about the cool pattern that's

322
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,740
on the inside it's about how they

323
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,800
portray the outside wait no I just said

324
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,800
that wrong dude what's the worst oh

325
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,360

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,999
[Music]

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,819
there's not one movie soundtrack I could

418
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,980
ever hit Shuffle play on ever

419
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,500

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,640
that's true

421
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,900
I wasn't thinking of it like that yeah

422
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,699
cause that's a show where there's songs

423
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,620
Incorporated I was thinking for like

424
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,360

I thought it'd be funny it's funny

444
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,179
I feel like more bushes that are local

445
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,340
like when you walk around you should

446
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,500
have just berries on them like have fun

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,740
with like your walk be then I feel like

448
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,720
that would lead to so many problems

449
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,080
little kids with dirt on their face no

450
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,059

who do hold on I do have to say this

455
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,600

456
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,980
like plants out there you're still

457
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,419

have plants outside their homes like

459
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,200
with berries in it and such like they

460
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,660
treat it better than they do their

461
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,100
firstborn child yeah it could be talking

462
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,080
to a stranger on the side of their road

463
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,940
but but the stranger could come over and

464
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,500
grab a raspberry and then they hang up

465
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,539

466
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,220

we imagine how much more

487
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,900
imagine how much better life would be if

488
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,980
you could just go on a stroll and eat

489
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,380

jump out of him and then tackle all the

534
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,260
damn Gators down to the ground and then

535
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,120
as he's fighting the Gators I'm gonna

536
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,620
throw a crocodile on his head and then

537
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,039
he's gonna be fighting all these gators

538
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,140
one crocodile and one Jillian Gators and

539
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,659

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,299
the gator fight showdown of the lifetime

541
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,539
event he's got to actually share a

542
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,539
thought

543
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,020
shut up shut up I genuinely think that

544
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,360
like what are those scenarios that

545
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,980
