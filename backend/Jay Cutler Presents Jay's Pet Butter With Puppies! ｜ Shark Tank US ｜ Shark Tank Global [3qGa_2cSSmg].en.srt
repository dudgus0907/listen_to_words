Hey Sharks, I'm Brandon Faulen and

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
Sharks. I'm Jay Cutler, fourtime Mr.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,519
Olympia and this is Daisy and this is

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,800
Capone and we're here seeking $50,000

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,320
for 10% of our company. Sharks. Pet

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
owners like to treat their pets like

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
they're their babies. Case in point, and

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
we love to share everything with them,

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,040
including peanut butter. Unfortunately,

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
most commercial brand peanut butter is

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
full of things that just aren't good for

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,280
these little guys, such as salt, sugar,

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
hydrogenated oil, and even xylitol.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,160
Sharks. For over 20 years, I compete at

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,000
the highest level in professional

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,719
bodybuilding. I paid attention to

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,399
everything I put in my body, and I

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,559
thought, why not for my babies? Also,

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,239
introducing Jay's Pet Butter. So Jay's

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,600
Pet Butter is a unique line of pets safe

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
peanut butter made with the best

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,080
ingredients such as glucosamine for

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
joint health. Banana, blueberry, sweet

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,000
potato, vitamin E, and biotin. All to

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
make our pets happy and healthy. You can

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
use it as a healthy treat, a food

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
topper, a cover for medication, or a

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,240
distraction while bathing. The

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,040
possibilities are endless. And Sharks,

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,000
it comes in four unique flavors. And

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,360
listen, my happiness is my pets. I do

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,439
everything with my pets. They travel

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,439
with me, so why not? Treat.

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
Let me try some. All right. Oh, yeah.

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,040
All right. Shark. So, who's ready to

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
spread the love and change the lives of

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,840
dogs everywhere? Little guy.

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,640
I twice the size of his body.

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,799
Jay, I don't I don't think you came out

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,479
with a big enough. I don't I I don't

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
think people I mean everybody watching

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
will I mean you're Jay Cutler. Like you

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
are the man. I know. He's a beast. That

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
picture of you was insane. Jay. Yeah.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
Jay, how many years ago was that? Is

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,799
that real? 2009. Oh my god. How many

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,360
championships have you won? Four. Wow.

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,879
That's insane. That's incredible. Wow.

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
All right. I I probably missed half the

54
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,160
pitch. There you go. So these are them.

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
So we have three. Clearly Clearly though

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
for humans, too. Yes. So it's it's human

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
safe as you saw. I mean, this was his

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,640
secret all along. Um, and we encourage

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
you to try them. Everyone talks about

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
essential fats and things that are good

61
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,080
for you. And that's one thing. We've

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
added a lot of things in this product

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
which I took as supplementation. I mean,

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm an owner of a supplement brand, a

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
very large supplement brand. What's that

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,360
brand? It's called Cutler Nutrition. I'm

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,920
very active on social media. I have

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
about 16 million social followers. A lot

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,720
of it's educational, whether it's

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
nutrition or training. Does that

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
translate well into selling peanut

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,400
butter for dogs? Well, everyone knows me

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,280
really for my dogs. I mean, the dogs

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
have their own Instagram. I

75
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,560
see. And by the way, Jay, this is really

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,720
good. Which one you have? Which one you

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
want? I have the sweet potato blueberry.

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,920
I use this instead of using any kind of

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,080
other peanut butters. So, why couldn't

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,519
you just feed them peanut butter? What

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,879
makes this special and unique is the

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
fact that we do put the additives that

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,200
are good for their health. You know, a

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,440
lot of people give their pets vitamins

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
and minerals and special foods and stuff

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,480
like that, but this was something

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,480
unique. And with his background, you

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
know, in in nutrition, it it made sense

89
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
to put the two together. Let's talk

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,120
about the business. What does it cost to

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,879
make this? What do you sell it for? Sell

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
it direct? Is it in retail? Let's get

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,879
into it. Uh, so we started the business

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,159
last year. We had success right out of

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,680
the gate. We did some launches to see

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,360
how it would do. Again, getting into a

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
pet product. We wanted to see how his

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
market and my market at the same time

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
would. Brandon, we didn't ask what do

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,920
you mean your market? So, I'm an

101
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
influencer also. So, I have a following.

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,519
I had a a base in the peanut butter

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
industry. Uh, I ran a company for 3

104
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
years. I had some success with that.

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
But, your influence is concentrating on

106
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,360
what area? Fitness and lifestyle. Um, I

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,040
I I show a lot of my my relationship

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
with my son. I have a six-year-old son.

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,519
He's There you go.

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
I'm not a slouch. He's being humble a

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,439
little bit, guys. No, man. You look

112
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,879
great, baby. Look at that, buddy. Okay.

113
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
So, I mean, you guys are very credible

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,319
from this perspective. Keep going on the

115
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,080
business. So, we launched in in

116
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,000
September and we had a success right out

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
of the gate. Uh we had Hi come to us

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
right away and they wanted to put us in

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,519
some of their test stores to see how we

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,640
would do. And then we had a big big box

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,400
um warehouse come to us right away. What

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
did you sell it for? Uh we sell them for

123
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,120
$14.99. Wo.

124
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,080
Um that's expensive. Yes. What's a

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,600
normal cost? Peanut butter a high-end

126
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
jar of peanut butter will sell within

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
that range. So what's it cost you to

128
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,680
make this $14.99 item? So currently it

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,240
cost us $310. Oh, those are lip smacking

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,919
margins there. So, the thing that

131
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,479
happened up front is we had a little

132
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,080
success with with HY. Okay, we're in 80

133
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,080
stores. Then we landed some smaller

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,080
nutrition stores and then from there we

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
got the call from the big box warehouse

136
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
and they said, "Look, we're really

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,400
interested in you for 80 of our

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,720
warehouses in the Northwest region of

139
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
the country." The order itself could go

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
anywhere from $500,000 to a million

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,280
dollars. So, Brandon Jay, where are your

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,960
sales up to date? Our sales up to date

143
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,560
are um $39,000.

144
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,720
Oh. And and what period of time was

145
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,600
that? In about a 10-month period. Well,

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,680
here's a question. Jay, you said that

147
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
you have 16 million followers on social

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
media. Have you put out any videos, any

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,639
postings saying, "Hey, check out my

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,479
Jay's." We we have and we've had great

151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,120
success with that. Um is that how you

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,440
got the 39,000 in sales? Mo mostly, but

153
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
we just were having delays in shipping.

154
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,320
We just weren't ramped up enough. You

155
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
know, for me, the most interesting

156
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,560
question is, if Mr. Wonderful starts

157
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,600
calling you cockroaches or anything like

158
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,520
that, will you demonstrate some of your

159
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
prowess? I'll put them in a head box for

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
you and you can you can take care of

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
them from there. I agree with you. Dogs

162
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,759
love peanut butter and I agree with you.

163
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,680
Sodium is not good for the dogs. Well,

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,320
it's it's a good opportunity that you

165
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,080
take. Have other people uh entered this

166
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
space? There's a few other companies out

167
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,800
there. The largest uh actually contacted

168
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,560
us asking if they could cack for us. Um

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
they are a smaller company and they seem

170
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,280
to be happy with what with that. So you

171
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,199
don't have any large competitors. No.

172
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,199
Jay, you have a you have a really

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,039
successful supplement brand which

174
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
basically you're looking at the same

175
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
profile of a consumer, right? Somebody

176
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,039
who wants Yes. Which I have not even

177
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
tapped that market. Why aren't you

178
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,039
putting it through that distribution? It

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,639
it's a little different. And we just

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,800
have not put those wheels in motion

181
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
because of the manufacturing has been

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
our biggest hiccup. I can do supplements

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,280
all day long, but was a little different

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
because of where it was made. Yeah,

185
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
guys, look, I think it's a great

186
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,880
product. I liked it, right? But the

187
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
challenge for a product like this, it

188
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,360
takes time for pet owners to really

189
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,360
appreciate the benefits. So, I see this

190
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,520
more as a slow burn product as opposed

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
to an investable product. So, for those

192
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,919
reasons, I'm out. Thank you. Thank you.

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,400
Unfortunately, I don't eat peanuts. They

194
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,360
don't really agree with me. I do have to

195
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,360
love and I think participate in what I

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,720
really get involved with in a business.

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,479
I wish you good luck, but I'm out.

198
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,479
Listen, guys. Um, it's an honor to meet

199
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,199
you. Those pictures are very impressive.

200
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm a little bit intimidated that uh if

201
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
we disagree, you might put me on the

202
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,039
headlock, but in all seriousness, this

203
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,759
is just not my type of business. So, for

204
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,160
those reasons, I'm out. Thank you. Hey,

205
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,880
my my biggest challenge is uh I'd be

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,880
doing this just for training.

207
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
All right. You know, there's nothing I

208
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,360
can do here in this one. I don't think

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,520
you need a shark. I'm out. Thank you. So

210
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,039
guys, I don't see it as a company. I see

211
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,960
it as a product within your sphere of

212
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
influence because clearly you're a very

213
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
successful guy in the supplement space.

214
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,479
So it's very difficult to invest in this

215
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,800
as a business. However, the direct to

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,919
consumer play is a very good business

217
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
because I think your customer

218
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
acquisition cost given you have 16

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,639
million followers is going to be low.

220
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,639
I'll do the deal 50,000. The margins are

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,360
good enough to give me a royalty. No

222
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,240
equity. I'll do it for a buck a jar.

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,440
Buck a jar? Yeah. How long? In

224
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,280
perpetuity. You guys came in here to the

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,319
Shark Tank. Everybody said, "No, I don't

226
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,380
see it." I see it. I'll do the deal for

227
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,080
a royalty. What do you say, guys? day.

228
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,520
[Music]

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,960
Probably not something we'd like to do.

230
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,800
We appreciate the offer.

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,000
Thank you very much. Thank you very

232
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
much. I appreciate it. Would you like to

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,879
counter, man? You can counter to say,

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,680
"Look, you know, we'll do that till you

235
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,919
get two times your money back." Or

236
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
Why would I do that? Cuz you get two

237
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,959
times your money back and you get to be

238
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
friends with Jay. Oh, I make $50,000.

239
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm thinking about doing it just because

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,919
I like these guys. Just do the deal you

241
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,919
guys think is right.

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah, it's that's not the right deal for

243
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
us. I I thank you for the offer. Thank

244
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,440
you. Thank you guys. All right, guys.

245
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
Good luck, guys. Appreciate it, man.

246
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,200
It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you

247
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,200
so much. Thank you.

248
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,839
We wanted to present a great product. We

249
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,800
believe in the product. I know that it's

250
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,720
going to be successful. Uh, and you

251
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,720
know, we couldn't get a deal done with

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
the Sharks, but we're gonna make it

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
happen. I hope he comes back and kicks

254
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,640
your ass, Kevin. That's what I was

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,640
hoping for.
