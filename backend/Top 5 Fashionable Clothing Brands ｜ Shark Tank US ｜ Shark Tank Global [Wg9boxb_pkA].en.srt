00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,880
I'm Jonathan Tory. And I'm his brother,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,519
Alex Tori. And we live in Athens,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
Georgia.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,199
Okay, let's try the guacamole.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,039
I come from a super tight-knit Mexican

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
family, so it's no surprise that we have

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
a business together and the whole family

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,000
pitches in.

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,920
Can I help?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
We've developed a unique fashion brand

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
called Uman. We know that clothing is a

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
really great way to express your

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
creativity and we want to build a

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,480
fashion brand that has a really positive

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,239
social impact.

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
Pops, can you make sure we order some

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,040
more ink?

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,879
Jonathan and I put everything into

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,719
Umano. We move back home with our

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,879
parents. We share a room like we did

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,800
when we were 7 years old. We did that

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,879
willingly because we really believe that

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,719
UMANO has tremendous potential.

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,399
We're going to do two black V-necks.

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,239
Yeah, we got them right here. Because of

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
our mission, there's a lot of people

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,160
counting on us that we want UManu to be

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,480
able to help. But now with increasing

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,719
demand, we're missing opportunities

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,800
because we don't have as much inventory

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,400
as we should. We hope the Sharks will

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,439
join our movement where you can look

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,439
good and do good.

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:20,720
[Applause]

36
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:23,119
[Music]

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,360
Hi Sharks. My name is Jonathan and this

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
is my little brother Alex. We're from

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,799
Athens, Georgia and we're seeking

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,640
$150,000

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,280
for 15% equity in our business. Omano is

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,079
fashion for good. We design men's and

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240
women's elevated fashion basics with a

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,880
personalized meaning to connect people

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,759
to a bigger purpose. The awesome artwork

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,479
you see here is curated from some of the

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,720
most amazing upand cominging artists.

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,880
Kids, sharks, meet Jessica. She drew the

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,159
skull and wants to be a teacher.

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,719
How old is she?

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,439
She's seven.

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
Wearing Omano is a badge of pride and

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,320
it's a pledge because with every product

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,720
you purchase, Umano will give a backpack

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,760
full of school supplies to empower young

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
creative minds. Investing in Omano means

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
that you don't have to choose between

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
doing well and doing good. So, who wants

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,280
to take a ride with us on this elephant,

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,400
the tiny dancer drawn by 5-year-old

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,200
Emmanuel, or this bike, the Fixie drawn

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
by future firefighter Reuben?

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
We have handpicked some of our favorite

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
designs to show you, and we'll share

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
them with you now.

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
Yes, sir.

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Thank you, John.

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,920
You're very welcome.

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Thank you,

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,160
Mr. Wonderful. Thank you very much.

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,280
You're very welcome. Thank you. Thank

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
you.

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,160
It's really nice. Feels soft. We have

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
traveled the world literally to get that

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,959
fabric.

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,599
First of all, how much is it and how do

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
I buy it?

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,280
Those shirts that you have, they start

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,519
retailing at $48. We are sold at

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Bloomingdales. We are sold at specialty

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,920
stores across the country and through

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
our website.

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
Does it have the child's picture hanging

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,920
at Bloomingdales?

85
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
Yes. The way it's hang tagged is with

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
the hang tag that you currently see on

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
it.

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
Does the child or the parents, do they

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,760
get a royalty? So the way it's

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,959
structured now is that we have a really

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
good relationship with all of our

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,879
partner schools. We give the backpacks

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,959
full of school supplies, collect the

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,120
drawings, come back to Athens, Georgia

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
to create the artwork. So as the brand

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,159
expands, we will expand the giving.

97
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Can I ask is this a business or is this

98
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,200
a charity?

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
We are a business 100%.

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
So your pursuit is for profit.

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,760
The concept of social entrepreneurship

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,959
is right in the last 5 years, right?

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
People walk in, particularly

104
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,480
millennials, they don't just walk in and

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,799
buy a product. They walk in and buy a

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
cause.

107
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,640
But to sustain it, you've got to make a

108
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,159
profit.

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
Well, no, they go hand in hand. That's

110
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,080
we have the margins to do that.

111
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,560
The t-shirt is $48. Walk me how much you

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
pay for it. And then how much the gift

113
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
bag costs that goes back.

114
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
Retail $48.

115
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
Okay.

116
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,360
The cost of the product $7. The backpack

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,080
and school supplies is $4. So we load up

118
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,400
total at 11. We have a 48% margin. Plus,

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
where are these schools? Are they in

120
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
countries of need?

121
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,879
We have schools everywhere. We have

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,959
partner schools overseas in places like

123
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,879
Mexico and Peru where we manufacture in

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
Haiti, but also right here at home in

125
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,920
Athens, Georgia for us, Los Angeles,

126
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,919
Harlem, New York.

127
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
What were your sales last year and what

128
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
will you do this year?

129
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,600
Last year we sold $106,000.

130
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,600
This year we're scheduled to close at

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,880
250,000.

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,919
Getting into Bloomingdale's is so hard.

133
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
How did that happen?

134
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,280
It's not just getting into Bloomingdale,

135
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,880
but the doors we're in. We're in 59th

136
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Street. We're in Soho. We're in the

137
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
flagship stores. The reason we got in is

138
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
because of the story.

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
Do you guys have any inventory right

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
now?

141
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
We do.

142
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,160
How much is that?

143
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,240
8,000 units. Those 8,000 are already

144
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,040
sold.

145
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Do you plan to be a t-shirt company or

146
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
what's the full expansion of the land?

147
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,560
We absolutely want to be a lifestyle

148
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,840
brand and we can actually show you a

149
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
preview of our spring 16 line.

150
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
That's cool.

151
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,080
These are dresses. These are rompers.

152
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,680
These are leggings, hoodies, zip up. And

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,199
that's just on the women's side.

154
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
Guys, let's say you get to 10 million in

155
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,160
sales. Do you think there's any risk

156
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
that people turn around and say, "Let me

157
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
get this right. The children get a bag

158
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,080
worth four bucks. You guys are now

159
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,080
making $4 million a year in profit

160
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,600
pre-tax. It's child labor."

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,440
I mean, I could see a negative story

162
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
developing here. You worried about it?

163
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,400
That's definitely not one of the reasons

164
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
why the bigger brands can't go in and do

165
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
what we're doing. This is grassroots.

166
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Why can't they do that?

167
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,160
Because they're the ones that going to

168
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
be under the greatest microscope.

169
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,880
Correct.

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,039
It's an important point for us to make

171
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,840
that as the brand grows, we will grow

172
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520
the giving.

173
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,120
I think the designs are beautiful and I

174
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,080
applaud you for the cause. I agree with

175
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,759
you that people today care about what

176
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
they're buying and why they're buying

177
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,080
it. Absolutely. So, you're really a

178
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,520
design company with a great cause.

179
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,280
Tough business because designs are like

180
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,199
restaurants. Something's hot today, it's

181
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,320
not hot tomorrow.

182
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,720
I see a lot of risk. I'm out.

183
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Thank you very much. And on that note,

184
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,240
as you guys have already mentioned, for

185
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
us, millennials are are expanding. By

186
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,880
2018, they will surpass the purchasing

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
power of baby boomers. And those our

188
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,639
favorite brands are being discovered

189
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,800
right now. Guys, let me take a shot at

190
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,600
it. Look, it's very creative and it's

191
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
good-looking stuff. We've seen a lot of

192
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
t-shirts come through the Shark Tank

193
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,500
door. This is different. There's no

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
question about it.

195

[Music]

196
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,440
But it's embriionic.

197
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Maybe you can find a shark that wants to

198
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
start your journey here. I don't know.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,400
It's not me. I'm a

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,400
Thank you very much.

201
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,280
What's holding you guys back? What can

202
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
we answer? What's

203
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,759
You said the 8,000 units were already

204
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,440
sold. Where are they going

205
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,240
to fulfill the the Bloomingdales orders

206
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
until December

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
and you don't have the money to go out

208
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
and source more?

209
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,280
Correct. Our biggest challenge is

210
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
inventory and we are missing

211
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,240
opportunities. Blooms is asking for more

212
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,240
doors. We can't do that.

213
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,680
You guys are scrappy. You have a cool

214
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,280
look. I like entrepreneurs that are

215
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
willing to do whatever it takes. You

216
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,199
guys seem that way to me.

217
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Thank you.

218
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
And I like your mission. I'm going to

219
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,840
give you an offer.

220
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,330
I'm going to give you 150,000 but for

221
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,520
25%.

[Music]

223
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,560
you know, you're just starting. There's

224
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,880
a lot of design work to do. There's more

225
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
sourcing to do. I think that I can help

226
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
you a lot with that.

227
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,199
Thank you.

228
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
So,

229
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,240
that's that's amazing offer.

230
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
Congratulations. You made an offer. We

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
really appreciate it. There are are two

232
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
more sharks. We want to make sure that I

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
mean,

234
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
you know, I've been in this business for

235
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,199
quite some time.

236
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,520
I have maybe one brand in Bloomingdales

237
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,039
and I had to beg to get there. So,

238
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,240
we did a lot of begging. I have to I

239
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,240
have to congratulate you on that.

240
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,639
I would have to offer the 150k for 33

241
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
and the third.

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
Thank you very much for your offer.

243
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,639
You now have two offers.

244
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
And here's why I'm worth the third. It's

245
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
going to be all three of us working at

246
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,280
it.

247
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,319
I just know I bring a different skill

248
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,000
set.

249
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
And those are two amazing offers and we

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
really appreciate it. Jonathan and I

251
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,479
have worked

252
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,639
given everything we have.

253
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,639
We still have Mr. Correct. So we would

254
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,240
love to hear from I love what you guys

255
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
are doing. Really, where you need the

256
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,199
help isn't in the sales. You need credit

257
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,000
basically and you need online help.

258
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,080
Correct.

259
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,599
I'll make an offer of 150K for 20%. I'll

260
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
give you the option if Lori wants to

261
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,800
come in or Damon wants to come in.

262
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,440
That's fine. Just because it's a good

263
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,000
cause. So, but I'm happy to do it by

264
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
myself.

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
I go in with you.

266
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,640
Damon. Any

267
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,760
I have no need for non-Clo individuals

268
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,760
in my deal.

269
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,680
What an interesting situation. Damon

270
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
John, who's the fashion guru, wants to

271
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,040
be an equal partner. He's offered you

272
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,040
$150,000 for 33 and a3%. Mark and Lori,

273
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
who don't have the same experience in

274
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,720
fashion, are willing to give you the

275
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,880
same amount of money for only 20%. This

276
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,920
is one of the rare times in Shark Tank

277
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,800
history where two sharks are asking for

278
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,800
less equity than one.

279
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,040
What are you going to do?

280
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,320
It's a little brother's call.

281
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Damon, we we really thank you for your

282
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,279
offer. We need to be able to protect

283
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
some of that equity so that we can raise

284
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,399
more money in the future. We would love

285
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
to make a deal with my

286
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
So, we have a deal.

287
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,800
We have a deal.

288
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Awesome.

289
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
I can't wait to see the stoic.

290
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,640
I love it.

291
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,640
Oh my god.

292
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
E.

293
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
Thank you guys.

294
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm keeping the shirt.

295
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,320
Yes, it's all yours. Thank you. Thank

296
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
you. Congrats.

297
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Through our journey, we've probably

298
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,120
heard a 100 nos to one yes.

299
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,640
100,000 nos.

300
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,240
So, these yeses really help not only

301
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,800
build our own confidence, but also the

302
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,720
teams that we are on the right track.

303
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,399
I'm Eric. And I'm Sasha. And our company

304
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,640
is Buckmason. And we're based in Los

305
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,399
Angeles, California. American men are

306
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
ready for a different type of fashion

307
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
brand. One that's rooted in completely

308
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,920
different sensibilities, not connected

309
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
to fashion. This is a real truck of

310
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
shell button.

311
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,920
And you have a business model that

312
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,959
simplifies the shopping experience and

313
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,399
makes it impossible for guys to mess up.

314
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,720
How's the neckline this time?

315
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,800
20 and 38, baby. Americanade is

316
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,399
absolutely a priority for us. Most

317
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,839
people don't know that less than 2% of

318
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
clothing purchased in America is

319
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,160
actually made in America.

320
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,600
We really need to press the collar out

321
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
and get all the wrinkles out. The idea

322
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
of not having a personal relationship

323
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,800
with the craftsman making our jeans,

324
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
making our shirts, just didn't make

325
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,880
sense to us. Told me 88 bucks. Since

326
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
we've launched less than a year ago, our

327
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,399
business has been growing rapidly, and

328
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
every new product that we create sells

329
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,519
out immediately. We need this investment

330
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,959
to create enough inventory to keep up

331
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,240
with demand. The sharks shouldn't invest

332
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,519
in us just because we're made in

333
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
America. They should invest in us

334
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,560
because we're proving that Americanmade

335
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,440
can actually be profitable. And we're

336
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,440
doing that day after day.

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,440
Hi Sharks. I'm Eric Schnockerberg

339
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,760
and I'm Sasha Conn. We're from Los

340
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,079
Angeles, California. Our company is Buck

341
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Mason where we're seeking $200,000 in

342
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,600
exchange for 8% of our company.

343
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Growing up, I always thought my father

344
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,320
dressed cool. He wore the exact same

345
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,640
thing every day. Beat up blue jeans, a

346
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,279
white V-neck tea, and a flannel work

347
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
shirt. He was a brickmason, so I guess

348
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,720
he wasn't trying to look cool. He was

349
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,240
simply dressing out of function.

350
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,360
These days, it's pretty easy for a guy

351
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,200
to get overwhelmed when it comes to

352
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
shopping. Too many choices, too many

353
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
trends, too many products coming from

354
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,399
countries we've never even heard of.

355
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,720
We've created Buckmason to provide

356
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,800
highquality Americanmade clothing at an

357
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
accessible price point. We focus on the

358
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
basics like the perfect t-shirt, the

359
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
quintessential blue jean, and the

360
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,720
classic Oxford shirt. On our website, we

361
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,560
show our customers how our products are

362
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,519
being made and who's actually making

363
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,680
them. We call this Americanmade price

364
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,519
transparency. At BuckMason, we're

365
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,519
ignoring fashion trends. It's not about

366
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
standing out or fitting in. It's about

367
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
taste. And listen, we're not your

368
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
ordinary fashion designers. We're two

369
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,200
Midwestern guys obsessed with reclaiming

370
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
American quality. Sharks, who wants to

371
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,440
help us build the next great American

372
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,040
clothing brand.

373
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,560
Can we see some of the clothes?

374
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,480
Sasha's going to hand you some.

375
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,639
Thank you.

376
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah, save my size for me. Got my 28

377
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,839
inch waist.

378
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, this feels nice.

379
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,720
So, Eric, walk me through how I buy it.

380
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,959
Where do I get them?

381
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,279
Sure.

382
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,959
Sure.

383
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,800
Uh, we sell our products direct to

384
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
consumer online through the Buckmason

385
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,959
website.

386
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
There's two ways to purchase product.

387
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,880
One is the individual single items,

388
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
which, as you can see, are really

389
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
wearable.

390
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
They're cool now, they'll be cool 50

391
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
years from now. There is another way

392
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,800
that we sell merchandise on the site and

393
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
that's through curated packages. So what

394
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,200
we do is we put together three to six

395
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,240
pieces that you cannot mess up. The

396
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
reason why it would work for you is

397
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
because it's for guys that are just

398
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
busy, you know, guys that don't have

399
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
time to shop

400
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
or guys have no fashion sense.

401
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
And what do you charge for a pair of

402
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
jeans?

403
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
Uh so those jeans are 135.

404
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,880
135 is not cheap for a pair of jeans.

405
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
The $135 is a great value for the

406
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,360
product that we're actually making for

407
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,959
Americanmade. We're about as competitive

408
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,079
as you can get for the price.

409
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,480
Okay. And what about the shirts?

410
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,120
The t-shirts are 24. Button-down shirts

411
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
are 88.

412
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
Sasha, what are your sales so far?

413
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,120
Our sales are $300,000.

414
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
In what time period?

415
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
8 months.

416
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
8 months.

417
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
What did you do for a living before you

418
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
did this?

419
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
I've spent 15 years in the apparel

420
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
business

421
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,200
and I come from the totally opposite end

422
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,200
of the spectrum. I come from a more tech

423
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,279
media side. Prior to starting Buckmason

424
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,560
with Eric, I created a interactive

425
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,800
content platform called This Built

426
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,880
America, profiling companies that are

427
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,200
re-imagining American manufacturing.

428
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,079
That's cool.

429
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,519
And uh it did nothing but inspire me to

430
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,079
be completely passionate about what's

431
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,079
happening.

432
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,399
If I become a customer and I buy, let's

433
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,240
say, a shirt and jeans, I like it. How

434
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
many more times in a year do I buy?

435
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,079
What's the lifetime value of one of

436
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,399
these guys?

437
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,199
Well, 38% of our customers are repeat in

438
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,600
the last 8 months.

439
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
It's good.

440
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
And of that 38, 10% have purchased more

441
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
than three times.

442
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,160
That's amazing. So, you got guys buying

443
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,760
a white t-shirt, testing us out,

444
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
realizing they like it, coming back and

445
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
buying five more at a time. And that's

446
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
how guys shop.

447
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,519
What matters is brand. And I understand

448
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,760
what you're trying to do. Buck Mason is

449
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
an American heartfelt brand and you're

450
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
going to pick a price point where you

451
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,480
think your customer acquisition cost

452
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
online is going to be less than their

453
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
lifetime value. That's what this

454
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,680
business model is. Cuz I don't hear a

455
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,680
retail rollout strategy. I don't hear

456
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,839
you putting up retail stores in Soho.

457
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
Uh he's partially right. We've been very

458
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,880
successful today with acquiring

459
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
customers at very little to absolutely

460
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,040
no cost. We've been doing it through

461
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,480
both our social and PR channels. We've

462
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
had a lot of success through social.

463
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
It's been a valuable tool for us.

464
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,959
So, give us your metrics on social.

465
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
Instagram's been very helpful. We have

466
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,800
an influencer program. Okay. We identify

467
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
people that we relate to very well on

468
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,519
Instagram. They have very high amount of

469
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
followers. Most of them are

470
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,560
photographers. And the reason why we

471
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
focus on them and not specifically

472
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,600
putting a lot of effort into fashion

473
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,440
bloggers is because more or less we're

474
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
an anti-fashion brand. Like we're

475
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
focusing on the basics and the classics.

476
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,560
We're not following trends. And our

477
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,079
customer is following these

478
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
photographers, not the fashion blogs.

479
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
They're not GQ.

480
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
And what are you doing for these

481
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,880
photographers? Are you giving them

482
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
affiliate money?

483
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,920
It's a gifting.

484
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
Is your vision to take the 200,000 and

485
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,519
accelerate the existing business model

486
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,959
or are you going to expand into retail

487
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,800
or go into wholesale

488
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,519
primarily online? Stay with this

489
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
business model.

490
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
How much have you guys invested?

491
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,399
S and I are the only investors. We've

492
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,240
invested $10,000.

493
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,800
Are you can you do 500,000 this year? Is

494
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,199
that what you figured?

495
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,440
Sure. Yes.

496
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,480
Yeah.

497
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,760
And what are you going to make on that

498
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
after you pay yourself something?

499
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,440
We just started paying ourselves. We

500
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
think that we'll make about probably

501
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
about 35,000 on that.

502
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
Oo.

503
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,800
Guys, I think what you're doing is

504
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,279
great, but I just don't want to be in

505
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
the clothing business. It's that simple.

506
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,759
I'll be a customer. It's just not a fit

507
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,399
for me. And for those reasons, I'm out.

508
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,079
Thank you.

509
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,399
You're welcome.

510
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,360
I think it looks great. And I love the

511
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,040
Made America story, but um I think if

512
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
you were farther ahead, farther down the

513
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,199
road, I'm not sure how much I could add

514
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,639
to the mix of knowing what's really

515
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,279
right to hit guys in the heart of what

516
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,000
they want to wear. So, for that reason,

517
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm out.

518
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,480
Appreciate. Thank you.

519
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
Thank you.

520
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,040
Well, look, guys, incredible that you

521
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,000
gotten to this point with $10,000.

522
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
That's remarkable.

523
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Thank you. But I just don't understand

524
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,399
how customers are finding you.

525
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
Yeah.

526
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,320
And for me as an online company, that's

527
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,399
the struggle.

528
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,839
I'm out.

529
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
Appreciate it, Rob. Thank you.

530
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,320
You know, guys, basically companies in

531
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,480
clothing trade at around four times

532
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,040
their cash flow and they're much larger

533
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,320
than you are. So, you need to be making

534
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,800
somewhere between $6 and $750,000

535
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
after tax to get a valuation of 2.5

536
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
million.

537
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,880
You've come in and been very aggressive

538
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,480
in terms of your valuation here. And

539
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
it's not clear what you're worth yet.

540
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
It's a concept. It's starting to show

541
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,280
some traction. I love the branding. I

542
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
really do. But to get 200,000 out of

543
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,679
somebody, I think you're going to have

544
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
to part with half the company.

545
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,600
I think what you're investing in here

546
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,360
is, you know, the vision and the talent

547
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,160
on board. Come on, guys. If you've been

548
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,439
in the business this long, you know that

549
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,360
this valuation is somewhat crazy.

550
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
2.5 million, you're putting a value on

551
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,640
what you think you're going to do in the

552
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
future. I guess that's the value of it.

553
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
But my daddy didn't have two crystal

554
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,080
balls. So, I can't see in the future,

555
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,640
right? This is way too costly for me cuz

556
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,720
this is my industry.

557
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
I'm out.

558
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,039
So, there's one shark left.

559
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,880
Wow. The most fashionable sharks left.

560
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,840
Mhm.

561
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
Kevin,

562
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,720
I don't know what to do here. I'm not

563
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,640
sure what you're worth right now. You're

564
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
worth a partnership and the beginning of

565
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,200
a brand that no one's heard of until

566
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,679
today. So, the only way I can do this

567
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
deal is I'll give you $200,000. I want

568
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,360
50%.

569
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,000
And even that's generous. There's no

570
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,080
other way to do it because you're so far

571
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
from from making money. I mean, how are

572
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
you guys even eating?

573
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
That's why they make skinny jeans.

574
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,799
Eric Airbnbs is placing crashes on my

575
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,919
couch sometimes.

576
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,559
Well, that's what I mean. I mean that

577
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,039
that is a startup. You are governed by

578
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,000
gravity.

579
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,440
Is that your offer?

580
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,600
It is my only offer. I'll give I'll give

581
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,360
you 200,000 for 50%. I'll help get your

582
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,960
word out. I'm probably obviously going

583
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,760
to be one of your customers because I

584
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,640
like what you do.

585
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
I don't know if that's going to be

586
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
helpful.

587
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,080
I think it is. I'm very fashion forward.

588
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,280
So, you know, at the end of the day,

589
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,360
that's the only offer you're going to

590
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,360
get cuz everybody else is out. Um,

591
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,480
you know, this is something that we have

592
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,640
scraped and clawed to do and we're

593
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,039
building it brick by brick and, you

594
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,480
know, for us to give up more than 15%

595
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,160
equity in the company at this stage of

596
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
the game is not something we'd be

597
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
interested in.

598
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,480
You understand what gravity's done to

599
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
you here today in the Shark Tank.

600
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,640
Looking at the dollars you generate from

601
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
it in a commodity business, there's no

602
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,600
way to give you that value. But stick to

603
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,799
your guns, guys.

604
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,080
I mean, there's there should be no

605
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,360
desperation being accomplish.

606
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
Why don't you counter him?

607
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,919
Um, we would like to counter offer you

608
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,919
with 200,000 for 15% plus $100,000 line

609
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,640
of credit. Current would only go%

610
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,160
Yes.

611
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
15%.

612
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,720
They changed

613
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
for 200,000.

614
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
200,000

615
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,559
plus 100,000 line of credit specifically

616
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,760
for inventory.

617
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
They'll throw in a lifetime supply of

618
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
free clothing.

619
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
You get a lifetime supply of free

620
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,760
clothing. I can buy a lot of jeans for

621
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,520
$200,000.

622
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
What do you think?

623
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,520
You know, guys, I provide uh factoring

624
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,360
for all my companies. When you have real

625
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,039
sales and it's working, it's not hard to

626
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,039
finance that. I don't even worry about

627
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,120
that. I'm still stuck with how I ever

628
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,400
get my money back. Under the model you

629
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
just gave me, you're going to have to

630
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,320
make $2 million

631
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,080
after tax.

632
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,600
Kevin, all you got to do is go door to

633
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,360
door, sell some jeans, and at their

634
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,039
margins, it won't take you long. Look, I

635
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,039
I I'm It's the first

636
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,080
Eric, I'll give you the 200,000 plus

637
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,039
$100,000 on line of credit for 25%.

638
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
H, now it gets interesting.

639
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,760
Now it gets interesting.

640
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
Yeah, I'm not going to compete with

641
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
that. I wouldn't even do that deal. So

642
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
guys, if you don't want my original

643
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,320
offer, I'm out. And clearly, you don't

644
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,120
deal with that.

645
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,400
Yeah, I'll go I'll go uh down to 25%

646
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,000
from Kevin's. I think you're going to

647
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
make it. I don't know if I see the huge

648
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
future vision. You got to take me out

649
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,960
for a beer and explain how we're getting

650
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,080
customers, but I think you're going to

651
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,080
make it. Um,

652
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
would you consider

653
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
I wouldn't I wouldn't consider anything

654
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,039
below that.

655
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,640
So far from you need you need 800,000 of

656
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,440
free cash to get anywhere near even

657
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,720
that. Let me let me look. Robert's a

658
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
great partner and I'm going to sell you

659
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,600
on Robert and why you should do this

660
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,520
deal. You're going to be able to turn

661
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,080
your inventory from that cash so many

662
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,520
times and create so much more value with

663
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,679
that cash. You'll swamp the 10% delta.

664
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,200
That is a hell of a deal. That is a hell

665
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,720
of a deal with what you're at today. You

666
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,919
make no money. You're Airbnbing your

667
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,280
house, Robert. Robert, we're huge fans

668
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,720
and we we appreciate your offer. Um,

669
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
it's the right offer at

670
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
at this point.

671
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
It's the right offer. Don't make a

672
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,679
mistake.

673
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,520
Because we believe because we believe,

674
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,679
guys, you're overvaluing the Sometimes

675
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
cash is more valuable than equity.

676
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,960
Let the man.

677
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,159
Look guys, I am all about owning the

678
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,120
equity as long as you can, but some

679
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,799
businesses require cash upfront. 300,000

680
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,000
is going to get you inventory. You're

681
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,039
going to turn it over. You're going to

682
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
get to the next step.

683
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,320
Stop and think for a minute. If you're

684
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,559
going to walk out of here and you're

685
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,600
going to say to yourself,

686
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,600
"Wish I had said yes."

687
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,240
Robert, we know that we're going to get

688
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,200
there. For us, it's it's a matter of

689
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,559
when. And for us to give up for us to

690
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,559
give up that much equity at this stage

691
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,799
is not is not in our interest. We could

692
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,080
do the same deal for 17%.

693
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,039
Now guys, now we're getting into the

694
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,440
realm of silly. An 8% delta on something

695
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,360
this new, it just doesn't make sense.

696
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,559
This is really investment about you guys

697
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,080
and what you've built so far. 200,000

698
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:16,679
25% $100,000 line of credit. We'll get

699
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,679
there quickly together.

700
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,400
Thank you so much for your offer. for

701
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,400
your offer, Robert.

702
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,120
Um, we have to decline.

703
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Thank you so much.

704
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,840
Congrats, guys. Good luck.

705
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,240
Thank you.

706
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
Thank you.

707
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
Good luck.

708
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,720
We're trying to build something that we

709
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,200
could give to our children. Giving up

710
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,880
25% 10 months into the life of our

711
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,679
company is not in the best interest of

712
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
the long haul.

713
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,520
I really think that was the right offer

714
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
for them.

715
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
Welcome to my world, the world of

716
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
designers.

717
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Oh, come on.

718
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,840
No clue. Go.

719
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,420
Next up is a stylish way to show your

720
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:05,109
school spirit.

Yeah. Very good.

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,640
from Virginia Beach, Virginia.

727
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm the owner of Tones of Melanin O.

728
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm seeking $300,000 for 5% equity into

729
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
my business.

730
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,600
Hello.

731
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,159
So, Sharks, for years, thousands of

732
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,760
students, faculty, and alumni from

733
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,320
historically black colleges and

734
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,000
universities, also known as H.B.CU, use

735
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,320
have been underrepresented when it comes

736
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,120
to fashion. They're tired of bedazzled

737
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,120
t-shirt and polo being their only option

738
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,360
for years. Tones of Melanin is here to

739
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,280
fill that void. Tones of Melanin has

740
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,960
combined street wear and collegiate wear

741
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,039
together to create its own genre of

742
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,440
fashion. Today, we have over 40

743
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,960
different H.B.CU licenses. What makes us

744
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,720
so unique is that we come from the

745
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,559
community that we serve. Tones of

746
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
Melanin has become bigger than just

747
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,240
fashion. We've become the hub for all

748
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,640
things H.B.CU. So, Sharks, who's ready

749
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,390
to change collegiate wear forever? Give

750
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,140
it up for my band.

751
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:30,929
[Applause]

752
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,929
[Music]

753
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,360
So, today in front of you, you have some

754
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,600
of my signature items. Mark, you have

755
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,000
our reversible basketball shorts with

756
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
pockets. Ladies, we know that we have to

757
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,960
have pockets in all items. So, if you

758
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
turn that thing inside out, it's a whole

759
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,919
another pair.

760
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,120
I like it. Thank you. Right here we have

761
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,360
our Winston Salem half zip windbreaker.

762
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
In front of you, Mr. Wonderful, is our

763
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,960
reversible satin jacket. So, if you

764
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
unzip that, it's going to turn to a

765
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,960
whole another side. Lori, you have our

766
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,440
other windbreaker. It's a full zip. It

767
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,919
gives you a a blast from the past, a '9s

768
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,600
feel. And Damon, you also have our

769
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,880

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,039
Northfor State University.

771
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,640
Nice quality. How much does it cost you

772
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,039
to make? And how much do you sell it

773
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,559
for?

774
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,880
The jacket that you have right there,

775
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,640
um, we get it for 28. We sell it um on

776
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,080

778
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,440
reversible shorts right there we get for

779
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,760
20. We sell it to the department store

780
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,840

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,279
reversible jackets we pay $30 for that.

782
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,360
We charge 165.

783
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,720
How did you start to do this? And and

784
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,279
what's your background?

785
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,520
So I designed from early high school

786
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,200
into college. It became a side hustle. I

787
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,919
began designing for every organization

788
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,039
on campus. And I seen there that nothing

789
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,799
looked like the things that I was

790
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,159
designing. So I decided to start my own

791
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,760
brand. At the beginning I was doing

792
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,360
Greek apparel and then I decided to make

793
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,679
H.B.CU apparel because I seen that there

794
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,240
was a bigger need in that community.

795
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,320
And how many HBUs are, you know,

796
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,760
historical black colleges, universities,

797
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
how many of those exist?

798
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
Depending on the person, some might say

799
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,440
100, some might say 102.

800
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,720
And you have 40 licenses already in

801
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,080
existence. So that's great. You have

802
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,559
almost half of them, right?

803
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Yes. Um, but the thing is I've gotten um

804
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,000
our license for everybody that allows

805
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,000
it. The other schools they don't have

806
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
licensing programs in place.

807
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They don't have licensing programs in

808
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,279
place.

809
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,840
That might be an opportunity for you

810
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,640
right there.

811
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,080
Absolutely.

812
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,200
So a very big the number one shoe maker

813
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,640
in the world has just invested I think a

814
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,279
couple billion over 15 years to H.B.CU.

815
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,440
So this is a very very hot and fast

816
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,960
growing area. I tell you what gets me

817
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,279
hot to try is sales.

818
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
Yes.

819
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,679
What do you got?

820
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Uh to date we made 3.3 million sales.

821
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,039
Oh, that's over what period of time

822
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,400
since 2017.

823
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,880
So, what have you sold the last 12

824
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
months?

825
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
The last 12 months, we're at 1.4

826
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
million.

827
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,320
Wow.

828
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,720
Can you walk me through this calendar

829
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,039
year sales and potential profits?

830
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
Um,

831
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
and how they break down online versus

832
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,520
retail.

833
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,480
Okay. Um, this calendar year so far, we

834
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,760
made about $1.1 million. That equals up,

835
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,159
I want to say, maybe 75%. Um, the rest

836
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,640
are e-commerce. Uh we're currently in

837
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,039
Dick Sporting Goods Flet with services

838
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
uh 25 of the HB.CU bookstores and also

839
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,360
on fanatics. Literally two days ago I

840
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,279
got a purchase order from Flet for

841
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,080
$973,000

842
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,039
for our fall.

843
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,440
Wow. Wow.

844
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,720
So good for you. How exciting.

845
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,039
So are you going to make money this

846
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
year?

847
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,799
Uh yes we are.

848
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,080
What do you think you'll make?

849
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,240
Today we revenue we have 343,000 that we

850
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
made this year from the 1.

851
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,200
Okay. So you've profited about 25% so

852
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,960
far. You've got a purchase order for 973

853
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
coming in. Plus, you've got all your

854
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
other sales that are coming.

855
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,720
Also, we have more department stores.

856
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,720
How are you financing them?

857
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,880
Um, we have a really good manufacturer.

858
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
He allows for us to pay him after we get

859
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
our payment.

860
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
Now, this is very creative and this is

861
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,200
what in our business we call the

862
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,559
factories holding the paper. Yes, that's

863
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,159
what we called it. All right. And a lot

864
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,000
of people can learn from this. So, you

865
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,919
were able to scale because he's doing

866
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,559
that. So, what would the money be used

867
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,320
for then?

868
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,480
Um, the money would be used for we're

869
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,159
actually inhouse. We have a five person

870
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,679
team. So once they get here, we have to

871
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,480
tag them all that. I want to go into

872
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,000
fulfillment and having a 3PL company

873
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,440
tagging getting it ready for department

874
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,919
stores to make sure that that's right.

875
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,960
But you don't have to pay for a 3PL per

876
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,960
se. You find a good 3PL and then you

877
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,840
send them the inventory and then you

878
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,120
only pay as they pick.

879
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,520
We would also use it for marketing.

880
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,000
We've only um spent $50,000 in

881
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,360
marketing.

882
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,120
But do you need to spend anything on

883
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,399
marketing? I honestly believe that we do

884
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
because all the stores that we're in,

885
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,600
we're not even we don't have like a key

886
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
a key place in the store. We actually

887
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,039
wanted those other schools that we don't

888
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,679
have licensing for convincing them, hey,

889
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,120
choose us.

890
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
Yeah. Marketing won't change their mind.

891
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,880
The sell through will.

892
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,320
Okay. Yeah.

893
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,720
Are you running this yourself?

894
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,679
Yes. I'm head designer. I'm talking to

895
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,039
the manufacturers.

896
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,039
This is your baby and you're running it

897
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,919
dayto-day or is there a separate CEO or

898
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,039
No, I day.

899
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,600
You wear everything, right?

900
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,919
Every hat. Every head. Ashley, I have to

901
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,080
ask you this. I mean, your enthusiasm,

902
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,480
your confidence is huge. huge

903
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,760
and amazing. Can you please tell us a

904
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,640
bit more about your story? Like where

905
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
did this come from?

906
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,399
My grandparents had one of the first

907
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,120
African-American beauty supply companies

908
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,520
in our area. So I seen entrepreneurship

909
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,120
firsthand. And then when I turned 13,

910
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,279
but my mom worked for the Ford company

911
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,039
subsidiary. They left Northern Virginia.

912
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,960
So I went into hustle mode and it was

913
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,640
like I could at least pay for me to go

914
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,720
pay for lunch for myself. I can pay to

915
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,000
get my hair done. So it just it became

916
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,440
second nature to be honest.

917
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
You had to take care of you.

918
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,200
Yes. Yes. And it wasn't my mom never

919
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,880
asked this. I just wanted to help. Like

920
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,919
I know I can do this for myself. Like I

921
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,480
can handle this. You don't worry about

922
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,279
that. Mom,

923
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
you're hot stuff. Yeah. I like it.

924
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,679
Ashley, you've got to be putting money

925
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,159
in your pocket right now.

926
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,520
Not yet.

927
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,799
You're investing in inventory.

928
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,200
Everything is going right back into the

929
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,880
business.

930
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,919
You're not making a salary. You don't

931
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,000
pay yourself anything.

932
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,720
I pay myself next to nothing. I'm still

933
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
trying to get

934
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,919
How are you surviving?

935
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,679
Uh I have a great community. My family,

936
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,320
my mom, she believes in me.

937
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,840
That is really mindblowing

938
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
problem for me.

939
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,240
I don't know much at all about this

940
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,799
area. I am not really and never have

941
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,960
really been much in the apparel world

942
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,760
nor in the sports and

943
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,320
I understand

944
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,480
it's not really my thing and so for that

945
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,000
reason I wish you good luck but I'm out.

946
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,080
I appreciate it. Thank you.

947
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,799
You are on fire.

948
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,559
Thank you.

949
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,200
But this isn't a business I know a thing

950
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,919
about. Sadly I'm out.

951
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
Ashley, I look at it as a inventory

952
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,440
challenge because the bigger you get,

953
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,919
the more capital you're going to need to

954
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,240
hold all these different SKs and more

955
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,080
licenses, more SKs, more inventory, more

956
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,080
capital. That's what I've learned about

957
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,919
the clothing business. It's not a

958
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,640
business I want to be in. I'm sorry. I'm

959
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,600
out.

960
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,279
Thank you.

961
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,000
The challenge I have is I I'm I'm in

962
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,200
this area in certain aspects. I I either

963
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,600
advise or own companies in this area.

964
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,679
Eastman Golf and Actively Black Foo and

965
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,919
then another company you may know of

966
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,640
AACA

967
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
familiar.

968
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,039
So I I would uh it would be challenging

969
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,360
for me to split hairs like this and I

970
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,279
don't think I would be giving you doing

971
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
a service but I will give you one idea.

972
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,559
Instead of having trying to go to a lot

973
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,640
of retailers, we've had one

974
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,039
representative young man and one

975
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,120
representative young woman at each

976
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,720
school who are the official sellers of

977
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
the goods and they get maybe $1,000

978
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,080
$2,000 worth of product and sell however

979
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,679
they want and they've been doing it like

980
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,360
that. I would highly suggest you do that

981
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
but at this moment it's a conflict for

982
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,000
me.

983
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,960
I appreciate your advice. Thank you.

984
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,679
Absolutely. I'm out.

985
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,679
Thank you.

986
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,600
So Esther, you're a superstar. You're a

987
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,200
force of nature. You know your stuff

988
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,039
cold. I mean you didn't back down. You

989
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,159
kept a smile the whole time. Nobody

990
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,520
phased you even the tiniest bit. And you

991
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,760
know, being in the business I am with

992
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,760
the Mavericks, I know a few people that,

993
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,360
you know, are excited about all this.

994
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,320
So, I'll make you an offer. We'll see if

995
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,600
you like it. I'll give you the $300,000,

996
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,679
but I want 15%.

997
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,840
Can we do 12?

998
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,519
Done.

999
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,640
Wow, that was quick.

1000
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,559
Good job.

1001
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,320
You're the best. You're the best. That's

1002
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,919
awesome. I'm so excited.

1003
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,279
Excited. Excited. Excited. Thank you.

1004
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,720
Now go sell some stuff.

1005
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,720
Yes, absolutely. Make me some money.

1006
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,240
I made a deal with Mark Cuban, like one

1007
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,919
of the biggest sharks there is. I

1008
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,840
provide a beacon of hope. If I made it

1009
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,360
and I went to an H.B.CU, I'm providing

1010
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,799
the sense of hope for anybody that

1011
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,360
attended an H.B.CU.

1012
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,830
Next up, an original way for kids to

1013
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,070
express themselves.

1014
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:31,140
[Applause]

1015
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:31,140
[Music]

1016
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Hi Sharks. My name is Jennifer Stein

1017
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,880
Bishoff and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

1018
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,200
I'm seeking $250,000

1019
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,320
in exchange for 10% equity of my

1020
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,240
company, Super Mix Studio Sharks. As a

1021
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,000
mom, I've witnessed the self-esteem

1022
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,799
boost that kids get when they pick out

1023
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,640
their own outfit. As a designer, I

1024
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,240
wondered how I could enable kids to

1025
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,519
create something that's a true

1026
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,720
reflection of who they are. Introducing

1027
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,000
Supermix Studio, the world's first

1028
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,640
interactive custom kids clothing brand.

1029
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,880
Our innovative platform empowers kids to

1030
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
celebrate their individuality by

1031
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
designing their own clothes. If a video

1032
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,679
game and a clothing brand had a baby, it

1033
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,519
would be Supermix Studio. Users can

1034
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,440
hyperpersonalize our clothing and

1035
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,880
accessories and create something that's

1036
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,039
100% original. Just like Jake, who loves

1037
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,600
soccer and skating,

1038
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,240
nice,

1039
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,720
and Jasmine who loves tennis and dance.

1040
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,679
But Supermix is really all about the

1041
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,600
design experience. Let me show you.

1042
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,320
First, visit our website and choose a

1043
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,320
style. We have sweats, denim jackets,

1044
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,480
backpacks, and accessories, all made of

1045
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,440
sustainable materials. Then click

1046
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,080
customize. Now our design platform opens

1047
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,799
up and you'll find over 500 premium

1048
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,880
patches to choose from. Just drag and

1049
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,080
drop and place them anywhere you want on

1050
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,600
the style. The front, back, sleeves, and

1051
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,519
even the hood. Step three is our job. In

1052
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,639
our studio, we bring your child's

1053
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,040
masterpiece to life. As you can see, May

1054
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,520
is wearing the final product just like

1055
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,079
the one designed on screen.

1056
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,960
Nice.

1057
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,280
Nice. And the best part, your kid won't

1058
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,159
want to take Supermix off because

1059
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,119
they're proud of it. That's the Supermix

1060
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,520
magic. Sharks, who wants to join me in

1061
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,359
empowering kids to express themselves by

1062
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,679
literally wearing their hearts on their

1063
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:36,800
sleeves. Ready, set, patch.

1064
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,760
Good job, guys.

1065
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,599
Good job, guys.

1066
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,399
Thank you, guys. You're amazing.

1067
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,399
Thank you.

1068
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,280
Good job, guys. Thank you. Excellent.

1069
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,599
Excellent. Bye. sharks. In front of you,

1070
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,760
you'll find Super Mix that I took the

1071
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,560
liberty of designing for you.

1072
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,560
Oh my goodness.

1073
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,159
Of course.

1074
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,520
All right, I'm in.

1075
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,480
It's really cute.

1076
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,160
Sniffle,

1077
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,839
Robert, you have our classic denim

1078
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,320
jacket. And what you're seeing there are

1079
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,720
our superized patches. As I mentioned,

1080
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,880
we have over 500 patches and we have

1081
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,720
over 30 of these large superized

1082
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,359
patches, which is really what everybody

1083
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,320
gets super excited about. It's really a

1084
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,359
cute idea.

1085
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,480
Very cute.

1086
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,040
This is really well made. It is thick.

1087
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
This is a jean jacket, but it's soft.

1088
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,280
Yes.

1089
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,920
And how much is it? What would this jean

1090
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
jacket cost?

1091
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,440
Sure. So, that jean jacket is $69.

1092
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,440
That's the base price. We're seeing an

1093
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,520
additional $15 to$20 upsell in all of

1094
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,680
the patches per design. It comes

1095
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,040
That's an amazingly good price.

1096
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,800
It is an amazing price.

1097
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,160
What does it cost you to make? So that

1098
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,240
denim jacket is 1375 and as I mentioned

1099
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,160
it retails for 69. So the margins on

1100
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,359
denim are in the high7s.

1101
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,119
What about in the sweatshirts?

1102
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,640
The sweatshirt. So Damon, the sweatshirt

1103
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,280
that you have there is 705 and retails

1104
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
for 55.

1105
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,680
And it appears that you're actually

1106
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,560
manufacturing the patches yourself.

1107
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,880
All of them. All of the patches are 100%

1108
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,320
proprietary artwork. I'm a designer.

1109
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,560
I've been in the industry for two

1110
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,000
decades. I'm responsible for generating

1111
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,359
billions of dollars in a pair of

1112
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
companies were you with?

1113
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,240
Well, my first big job was for Gloria

1114
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,960
Vanderbilt. I was hired to launch their

1115
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,760
first ever junior brand. I would create

1116
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,480
a gene there that ultimately was written

1117
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,480
up as the $100 million fit. Tommy

1118
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,400
Hilfiger saw that article and the next

1119
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,119
thing I knew I was sitting in his office

1120
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,200
and at 28 he hired me to be the vice

1121
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,040
president of design for Tommy Jeans to

1122
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,599
breathe some new energy into the brand.

1123
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,520
Wow,

1124
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,079
Jennifer, you're a real loser.

1125
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,880
Yeah. So, you have no experience going

1126
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
at all.

1127
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,000
My last role was as chief merchandising

1128
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,240
officer for a large-scale private

1129
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,680
children's wear manufacturer. It took my

1130
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,680
entire career to finally figure out that

1131
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,440
kids is what I love doing the most. This

1132
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
is definitely the most fun I've had in

1133
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,720
in my whole career.

1134
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,760
What inspired you to say enough of the

1135
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,000
corporate world?

1136
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,520
It was the pandemic and my kids were

1137
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
home and I was just looking for things

1138
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,839
to keep them busy. We started tie dying

1139
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and putting patches on things. I was

1140
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,520
like, "This is so much fun. This is the

1141
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
white space idea that I'm keeping for

1142
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,440
myself. I love this."

1143
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,040
So, you're rolling out kiosks. Where

1144
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,800
would the kiosk be going?

1145
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,040
So, we're looking at taking these kiosks

1146
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,040
to all kinds of physical locations. The

1147
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,359
first people that we're testing the

1148
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,680
kiosk with is actually with Claire's.

1149
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,839
They're the premier destination of all

1150
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,000
things tween. Smart. But we're also

1151
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,720
looking at putting them in kids clubs at

1152
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,359
resorts and on cruise ships and of

1153
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,000
course department stores and boutiques.

1154
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,640
Okay. So when you came in I thought that

1155
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,400
this was you do this online direct to

1156
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,440
consumer. I go to your website. That's

1157
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,000
correct. Yeah. Me too.

1158
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,200
Is this now an expansion? Yes.

1159
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,359
But Jennifer why?

1160
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
Well because I'm a trend forecaster and

1161
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,160
that's how I've been successful in my

1162
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,280
career by doing things that haven't been

1163
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,359
done before. And this is an incredible

1164
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,320
instore experience. Everything's about

1165
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,760
retail tamement.

1166
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,359
What are your sales?

1167
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,440
I launched in October of 22. My first

1168
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,079
holiday season was $60,000.

1169
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,720
Okay.

1170
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,960
And year to date, we've done 110. So,

1171
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,240
it's 170 lifetime sales.

1172
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,720
You're not making any money yet, are

1173
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,440
you?

1174
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,119
Not yet.

1175
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,200
You're not selling the kiosk at all.

1176
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,920
You're putting them in stores, right?

1177
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,560
It's a very interesting relationship

1178
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,560
with our retail and venue partners.

1179
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,240
I hate this kiosk idea. Take your retail

1180
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,839
shackles off. Set yourself free.

1181
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
I am be reborn.

1182
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,800
I am reborn and I'm very happy to go

1183
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,359
into this from a DTC perspective, but we

1184
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,359
all know that customer acquisition costs

1185
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,640
are very expensive and they're rising

1186
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,680
and they're getting more and more

1187
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,040
difficult. This is customer acquisition.

1188
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,760
Yeah, but it's not. This is

1189
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,440
It's not. And here's why. Because we've

1190
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,079
gotten to the point now with direct to

1191
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,560
consumer where there's online and

1192
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,720
there's instore and typically when you

1193
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,440
make the decision to go in store it's

1194
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,760
the immediiacy of the product right I

1195
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,920
can grab it and get it right there

1196
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,359
that doesn't happen with your kiosk

1197
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,200
I think you're going to have people walk

1198
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,640
up to it and maybe put in some

1199
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,720
information which is great for customer

1200
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,400
acquisition and then expect it to pop

1201
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,800
out and you're going to get a lot of

1202
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,480
canceled carts because that product

1203
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,400
isn't right there. So, for those

1204
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,000
reasons, I'm out.

1205
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,079
Damon, what are you doing?

1206
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
I'm struggling. I I like I like this

1207
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,320
thing a lot. You know, this kiosk thing

1208
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,119
can either be a massive hit or a real

1209
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,720
problem. It's just too risky for me. So,

1210
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,800
I'm out.

1211
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,880
Jeff, incredible quality, great price

1212
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,520
point. The sales are so low and now

1213
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,560
we're going into kiosks,

1214
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,560
but I still love it.

1215
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,240
Two Sharks are out and Robert may be

1216
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,760
interested in Jennifer's customizable

1217
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,000
kids clothing brand, Supermix Studios.

1218
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
I I hear your feedback about the kiosk

1219
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and it's certainly giving me a lot to

1220
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,320
think about. The people in the space

1221
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,240
that I've shown it to have been very

1222
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,079
very excited about it. It's an

1223
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,720
incredible instore experience keeping

1224
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,760
people in the store longer. Why do you

1225
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,520
pay the retailer?

1226
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,640
And the arrangement here as we're

1227
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,880
discussing going into Claire's is that

1228
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,480
they will receive 30% of the revenue

1229
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,040
driven from the machine. That's fine.

1230
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,040
It's a win-win. Ultimately, I'm holding

1231
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,960
the inventory and fulfilling. So, all

1232
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,920
they have to do is put this kiosk in

1233
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,000
their store and then it's it's 100%

1234
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,560
incremental volume. I'm telling you,

1235
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,800
this is the next massive children's

1236
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,680
brand. Imagine it as the Build-A-Bear of

1237
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,839
apparel.

1238
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,839
Let me take a stab at it. Okay. You're

1239
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,680
very impressive and I really believe in

1240
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,320
the demand and it all came to you during

1241
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,040
CO 19. But before CO 19, you got a

1242
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,200
different virus. It's called retail 19

1243
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,440
and it's it's running through your veins

1244
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,680
even now. You can't let it go. It's 30

1245
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,400
to 40% of your margin forever. It's a

1246
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,480
curse.

1247
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,200
But she's selling online.

1248
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,599
She's about to do retail, which I hate.

1249
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,319
I'm sorry. I'm out. And and don't come

1250
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,880
too close to me with that retail 19.

1251
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,640
I mean, that's just me.

1252
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,200
Listen, I actually think you're pretty

1253
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,599
brilliant.

1254
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,599
Thank you.

1255
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,040
I think that you think out of the box.

1256
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,560
You're an innovator. You've done

1257
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,800
something completely unique and

1258
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,720
different. And I think it's super smart.

1259
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,119
I see this for Disney. I see this as in

1260
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,800
places where you have the mom and the

1261
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,480
kid. They're a captive audience,

1262
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,800
right? It's empowering and

1263
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,400
it feels empowering to me. All right.

1264
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,000
So, okay. We're going to make you an

1265
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,760
offer. I don't know. We're going to

1266
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,680
figure it out. I mean, honestly, I've

1267
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,680
never done a kids clothing line.

1268
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,720
Oh, we're going to do a kids clothing

1269
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,560
line.

1270
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,119
So, at this point,

1271
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,520
yeah,

1272
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,040
while you're on to a great thing, it's

1273
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,119
still pretty early. We're going to offer

1274
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,440
you 250,000.

1275
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,680
We want 25%.

1276
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,720
We'd also like a royalty because we pay

1277
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,720
you a cash flow of 5%.

1278
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,839
Until we make back the initial

1279
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,280
250,000. After that, it goes away 5%.

1280
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,319
And then it goes away.

1281
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,680
What a bad deal.

1282
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,800
Well, you can negotiate. I

1283
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,200
mean, Mark, you're not putting up any

1284
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,640
money.

1285
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,880
Mark is not in this deal.

1286
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,960
I do not find that a bad deal in today's

1287
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,359
market. Capital is completely dried up,

1288
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,280
particularly in your space. The fact you

1289
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,000
have an offer goes to your credibility

1290
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,440
in your past, even though you are

1291
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,440
infected with retail 19.

1292
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,040
Obviously, it's really important for me

1293
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,599
to remain liquid and to be able to grow

1294
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,079
this company. So, I'd like to counter at

1295
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,720
20% and

1296
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,720
2% royalty.

1297
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,119
I'm sorry. I just can't.

1298
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:55,760
All right, Jennifer. 250,000,

1299
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,400
20% equity, 3 12% royalty.

1300
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
Lori,

1301
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm good with that. Are you?

1302
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,960
The royalty goes away after you're

1303
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,960
payback.

1304
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Correct.

1305
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,280
You have a deal. Amazing.

1306
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,079
Thank you so much, Lori.

1307
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,680
Congrats. Well done.

1308
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,400
Great presentation.

1309
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,240
Thank you so much.

1310
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,079
Lose the retail.

1311
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:27,119
Oh my gosh. We did it.

1312
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,680
This is so awesome. Lori and Robert just

1313
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,599
got it. They really understood what I

1314
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,520
was doing and this is the next big thing

1315
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,000
and this is revolutionary and they saw

1316
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,160
the vision and I couldn't ask for

1317
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,520
anything more. This is absolutely

1318
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,960
incredible. So exciting.

1319
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,200
[Applause]

1320
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,930
Next up is a company with a mission to

1321
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:55,320
normalize mental health struggles.

1322
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:55,320
[Music]

1323
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,599
Hi Sharks. My name is Sophie Nstico. I'm

1324
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,280
from Trumble, Connecticut. And I am here

1325
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,200
seeking $250,000 for 10% of my business.

1326
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,880
Sharks, you may not be able to tell from

1327
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,319
the big smile that I have on my face,

1328
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,839
but I cry. And I cry a lot. But guess

1329
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,839
what? We all cry because we're human.

1330
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,440
Kevin, I know you have a tough exterior,

1331
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,920
but I've seen even you shed a tear in

1332
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,000
the tank.

1333
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,000
Never happens.

1334
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm on a mission to destigmatize mental

1335
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
health as it's not something that we

1336
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,040
should hide, but rather something that

1337
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,880
we should embrace and wear it proudly.

1338
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,119
And that's exactly why I created See the

1339
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,480
Way I See, a size inclusive mental

1340
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,400
health awareness clothing brand that

1341
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,160
emphasizes positive affirmations in a

1342
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,160
way that's never been done before. What

1343
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,839
we do is simple. We add signature

1344
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,440
reassuring reminders to the sleeves of

1345
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,800
your sweatshirts to give people that

1346
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,200
little boost that they find themselves

1347
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,680
needing. So Lori, if you're anything

1348
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,960
like me, you're an overinker. Just

1349
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,640
remember to breathe in and breathe out.

1350
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,839
And Mark, if you're ever feeling anxious

1351
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,359
about all the deals you have in the

1352
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,960
works, just look to your sleeve to be

1353
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,880
reminded that this feeling too shall

1354
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,240
pass. And I get it. If you don't want to

1355
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,160
wear your heart on your literal sleeve,

1356
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,599
we also have rings, stickers, keychains,

1357
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,880
and so much more to give people that

1358
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,359
reminder to carry with them throughout

1359
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,880
the day. Sharks, I built a community

1360
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,040
through the power of social media, and

1361
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,960
my followers are with me every step of

1362
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,880
the way. Together, we are breaking down

1363
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,560
barriers to end the stigma surrounding

1364
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,800
common mental health struggles once and

1365
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,280
for all. So, what do you say? Are you

1366
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,880
ready to see the way I see? Sharks. In

1367
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,400
front of you is a crew neck, a keychain,

1368
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,000
and a sticker that I designed. So, feel

1369
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,560
free to check them out and get in your

1370
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,240
feels.

1371
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,119
Sophie, how did you come up with your

1372
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,520
business idea?

1373
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,359
You know, since I was young, I've always

1374
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,960
had a passion for helping others. I

1375
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,520
always knew that I wanted to be a nurse.

1376
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,880
And, you know, going into high school, I

1377
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,960
started to develop pretty severe

1378
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,680
anxiety. Fast forward to my sophomore

1379
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:47,200
year of nursing school, I started to

1380
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,760
develop even more severe anxiety. So, I

1381
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,400
decided to go down to part-time. And in

1382
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,040
that time, I refound my passion for art

1383
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,839
that I've had since I was 10. I took the

1384
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,079
$500 that I had in my bank account. I

1385
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,119
bought a printer and a sticker cutting

1386
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,599
machine. I started to design mental

1387
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,599
health based stickers. I started selling

1388
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,319
them online. And I just continued to

1389
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,240
reinvest the money until I was able to

1390
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,760
actually purchase my first order of crew

1391
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,760
necks. And I thought that it was going

1392
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
to take at least two to three to four

1393
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,200
months to sell a hundred sweatshirts.

1394
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,720
And I was willing to do it. But to my

1395
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
surprise, it only took two days for it

1396
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,800
to sell.

1397
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,160
Oh my gosh. Nice.

1398
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,760
What happened?

1399
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,000
So I have been using social media for as

1400
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,599
long as it's been out, but I was able to

1401
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,240
use it to my advantage at this point

1402
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,920
where I was sharing my art on my page

1403
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,440
which was called See the Way I See. So

1404
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,720
that was also where the name came from.

1405
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,359
You were seeing my art from my

1406
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,040
perspective.

1407
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,560
So something's happening here. Are you

1408
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,359
spending a lot of money on advertising

1409
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,079
or not?

1410
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,599
None. I am.

1411
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,119
This is pure community.

1412
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,240
None. None. None.

1413
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,440
You go. That's awesome.

1414
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,480
Sophie, what you think you're going to

1415
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,800
be doing this year?

1416
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,960
So sales for this year would be

1417
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,160
$260,000.

1418
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,560
Is that year to date now?

1419
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,319
Actually, I'm sorry. That was $260,000

1420
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,520
in 24 hours.

1421
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,560
Wait, wait, wait,

1422
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,920
wait a second.

1423
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,280
Wait, hold on, guys. Let's take a couple

1424
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,640
steps. You're selling your stuff based

1425
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,800
off of drops then apparently.

1426
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,200
Yes, exactly. I'm trying to do a drop a

1427
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,720
month

1428
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,560
rather than having something for sale

1429
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,640
all the time. You make an announcement

1430
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,240
on social media. If you're doing it

1431
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,599
right, then there's a frenzy. Everybody

1432
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,520
tries to get it and it sells out

1433
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,280
quickly. Right. And so this is your

1434
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,880
primary product, your

1435
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
the crew necks and hoodies. Yes.

1436
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,680
Okay. So crew necks and hoodies, what do

1437
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,240
you sell them for and what do they cost

1438
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,800
you to make?

1439
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,680
Crew necks. I sell them for $60 retail

1440
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,720
and they cost $21 landed to make.

1441
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,760
Okay. And hoodies.

1442
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,880
Hoodies. Um, I charge $75 and those cost

1443
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,000
about $25.

1444
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,599
Okay. This year, year to date.

1445
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,400
Year to date. Year to date is $790,000.

1446
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,560
Wow.

1447
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,599
And how many people are in your company?

1448
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,920
Just me.

1449
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,800
You are making a boatload of money.

1450
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,160
Congratulations.

1451
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,280
Thank you so much.

1452
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,839
How old are you?

1453
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,240
24.

1454
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,560
What's taking you so long?

1455
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,200
So, how much money is in your bank

1456
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,440
account right now? So, I just had a drop

1457
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,480
and I need to purchase my next drop, but

1458
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,520
it's around $450,000.

1459
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,319
Nice.

1460
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,599
Wow.

1461
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,800
And that's profit, but you're just

1462
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,960
reinvesting your profit.

1463
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,319
Exactly. That I've started with $500 in

1464
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,760
my bank account and I've grown it to

1465
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,119
this point with nothing.

1466
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah. You know what? I'm getting

1467
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,400
anxiety.

1468
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,680
Wow.

1469
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,119
Listen, I have a crew neck for it.

1470
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,880
That'll reduce your anxiety for sure.

1471
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,400
Sophie, I got a I got an idea of a

1472
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,720
business that I want to start. I'll sell

1473
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,000
you 20% for $450,000.

1474
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,119
Well, you're selling to her?

1475
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,800
Yeah, she got the money.

1476
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,839
So, what do you need a shark for? You're

1477
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,079
doing so well.

1478
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,079
So, I'm proud of myself for how far I've

1479
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,160
gotten it, but I have zero background in

1480
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,000
business. My family has zero background

1481
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,200
in business, and I just feel like I'm

1482
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,680
hitting that point where I need a

1483
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,160
mentor.

1484
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,480
Sophie, why do you think you're worth

1485
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,839
2.5 million bucks?

1486
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,520
So, total sales for my company has been

1487
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,240
just over 2.3 mil.

1488
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,920
Nice. and I'm projecting to finish at a

1489
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,000
million this year and then next year

1490
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,559
1.75. I just continue to see this

1491
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,960
business growing and continuing to

1492
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,640
scale.

1493
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,200
How much did you make on that 2.3

1494
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,319
million?

1495
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,920
So the first year was $900,000 in sales

1496
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,359
and that was the year that I really did

1497
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,640
not know what I was doing. So I profited

1498
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:20,559
still a good number around 115,000.

1499
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:23,520
And then the next year, 2021, I made

1500
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,280
$640,000 in sales, profited around

1501
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,079
235,000,

1502
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,839
and then this year 790,000.

1503
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,359
So, I'm start I'm finding my way.

1504
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,680
You're a star. You

1505
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,480
Sophie, this cash flow should bring a

1506
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,319
lot of peace to you. I mean, I got to

1507
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,720
tell you that I don't really know how to

1508
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,160
help you. A lot of people talk about

1509
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,880
when they're sitting or standing where

1510
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,280
you are, what's going to happen. Just

1511
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,760
listening to what already happened gives

1512
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,319
you 100% street credit. I mean, it's

1513
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,520
unreal. So, this thing where you don't

1514
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,040
know anything about business, I don't

1515
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,200
really buy it anymore. Okay. I mean,

1516
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,559
it's you're doing better than 90% of the

1517
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,920
people that stand in front of me there.

1518
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,920
That's just incredible.

1519
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,440
But look, I I it's not a fit for me. I

1520
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,240
don't know how to help you. You're

1521
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,880
killing it.

1522
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,800
Thank you.

1523
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,359
But for that reason, I'm out.

1524
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,040
Okay. People should be able to show

1525
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,760
their emotions and that's probably why

1526
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,240
we're in such a bad situation because

1527
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,200
people shame you for doing that. So, I

1528
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,720
applaud you for for doing this.

1529
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,960
But you don't need our help. I think

1530
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,640
you're doing excellent. And right now,

1531
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,400
you have a great community. That

1532
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,319
community is searching for people like

1533
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,079
you who they resonate with and they're

1534
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,000
ready to support you. And the proof is

1535
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,559
here. You don't need me. I don't think

1536
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,520
I'll add much value. Uh so, I'm out.

1537
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,559
Okay. Thank you. Listen, I think you're

1538
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,960
amazing. Thank you.

1539
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,359
I had no business background.

1540
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,240
A true entrepreneur to me is somebody

1541
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:49,440
who knows how to drive a business. You

1542
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,520
have great instincts and you figured it

1543
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,440
out. You actually maybe don't realize

1544
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,720
it, but you are a businesswoman. You

1545
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,359
already are.

1546
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,200
Thank you.

1547
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,599
I would not feel good taking a

1548
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,440
percentage of your company. I don't

1549
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,720
think you need it. I will be a

1550
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
supporter, not an investor.

1551
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,920
So,

1552
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,359
thank you so much.

1553
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,319
Sophie, what does being an entrepreneur

1554
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,359
mean to you?

1555
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,960
It means, you know, to me it shows me

1556
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,520
that I'm capable of a lot more than what

1557
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,000
I thought I was because it let me find

1558
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,520
that I am capable of doing this. And to

1559
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
become an entrepreneur is just something

1560
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,440
that I never thought

1561
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,960
not. I never thought I'd be standing

1562
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,160
here alone. So, you know,

1563
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,280
what what you've been able to accomplish

1564
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,520
is insane, right? And I'll caution you

1565
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,599
that, right? Let your community grow

1566
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,359
your business, not a team. Because when

1567
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,119
you bring in a team, you try to act like

1568
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,800
an old school business because that's

1569
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,040
what people think they they're supposed

1570
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,880
to do for a business. Be who you are to

1571
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,280
your community and your community will

1572
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,040
you'll grow with it. And you don't want

1573
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,040
an investor for that because you're

1574
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,720
already putting money in the bank and

1575
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,280
all we'd be doing is taking what you

1576
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,079
earn, right? Keep on being you. Keep on

1577
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,119
doing what you're doing because it's

1578
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,599
it's amazing. But

1579
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,040
thank you.

1580
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,839
I just wouldn't feel right. So for those

1581
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,319
reasons, I'm out.

1582
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,119
Thank you.

1583
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,400
You're welcome. Uh, you know, I think

1584
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,920
your great strength is your

1585
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,079
vulnerability.

1586
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,839
You would be hardressed to convince me

1587
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,119
that you were the least bit anxious on

1588
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,119
this carpet today.

1589
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,160
You have no idea.

1590
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,599
I have no idea.

1591
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,200
Well, you've got quite an act going

1592
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,359
because I couldn't pick it up and I'm

1593
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,400
listening carefully. Um, like the other

1594
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:22,640
sharks here, my problem I don't mind

1595
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,599
investing in your deal. you're a winner.

1596
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,359
But I like to feel important and I I

1597
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,200
play a key role with every one of my

1598
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,280
entrepreneurs. You know, either a

1599
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,240
mother, grandmother, advocate,

1600
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:37,040
supporter, basher, whatever they need, I

1601
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,040
become. What would I do for you?

1602
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,720
I think Mark put it best where maybe I'm

1603
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,440
in that old mindset of where I think I

1604
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,680
need a team. I'm not as clear on that

1605
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,200
answer anymore, to be honest.

1606
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,720
You're not sure you even need a shark.

1607
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,240
We're convincing you you don't need it.

1608
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,440
I know. I mean, all of you guys have

1609
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,119
such great points. So, I still feel as

1610
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,200
though I would need that extra guidance,

1611
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,680
but maybe that's the overthinker in me,

1612
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,839
you know?

1613
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,200
Yeah. Because you've come full circle on

1614
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,599
that. I'll go out

1615
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,319
for sure. Yeah, you don't need anybody.

1616
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,720
Thank you.

1617
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,800
All right.

1618
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,559
So, we're all out. We're sorry we wasted

1619
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,240
your time.

1620
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,640
Far from it, you guys. This has been eye

1621
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,200
opening for me. Thank you guys so much.

1622
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,960
Good luck,

1623
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,559
Sophie. Thank you.

1624
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,680
Well, she just went up a notch in

1625
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,160
self-confidence.

1626
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,680
Yeah.

1627
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,359
Yeah. Man, what a start.

1628
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,200
That was very difficult for me to do,

1629
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,480
but they really did give me a boost of

1630
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,760
self-confidence. I did it. I never

1631
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,599
thought that I would be standing here

1632
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,160
today, let alone being capable of

1633
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,920
actually forming a pitch and practicing

1634
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,920
it and saying it in front of the sharks.

1635
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,640
But after today, I really feel as though

1636
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,640
I can almost do anything.
