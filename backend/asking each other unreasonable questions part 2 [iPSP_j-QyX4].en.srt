1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
I'm literally out of breath cuz I'm like

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,520
that big.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,200
What are you talking about? Like I went

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,720
upstairs quick to grab something before

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,519
we started filming and I'm out of

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,559
breath. That's nice. Why am I winded? I

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,160
went up. I can't fool myself. Don't want

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,640
nobody else to ever love me. You are my

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,760
shining star, my diamond light, my love

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,400
fantasy. It's not a minute, hour, day,

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,880
or night that I don't love you. You're

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,199
at the top of my list and I know he's

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,239
dreaming of you. What would you do if

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,239
the world was end

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,239
up?

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,320
Guys, I'm addicted to this new game

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,280
called Royal Kingdom. This is not an ad.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,160
It's so addicting. Ridiculously.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,719
Chris is genuinely like how a person

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,920
who's making a royal kingdom ad would

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
sound is Chris's life motto for the past

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,359
week. It's concerning and crazy.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,080
Completely agree. Up everybody. Welcome

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,240
to another Sterno triplets Friday video.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,520
Um today we don't really have a goal in

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
what we're talking about. We just know

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
that we want to talk. And I feel like

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,960
this is when the most magic happens in

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
the Cernolo TripleA universe, right

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,840
Nick? I have no idea what that means.

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,080
And I don't know if I agree with it

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,159
either with my haircut right now. I

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,600
currently feel like like the Soundcloud

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,920
rapper that just keeps threatening to

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,880
drop music. Like that's how I feel. He's

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
like I can't have long hair. I'm going

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,280
to do something crazy. I just like I

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,680
have had the same exact haircut for 5

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
years. Uh-huh. And it makes me sick to

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
like see a video from like 5 years ago

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,640
today and feel like I look the exact

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
same. Like I feel like my So what do you

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,280
want? You have to do something about

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
this. You have to cut your hair. I feel

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
like my physical growth like has like

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Chris told me he's like next time I get

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,680
a haircut it's going to be crazy. Like

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm cutting all my hair off. And then he

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
went to get a haircut and then he came

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,320
back in 20 minutes. Like 20 minutes

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,079
passed. Mhm. No time passed and you

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,799
looked exactly the same. I just can't I

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,960
can't pull the trigger on it. I need to

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,799
do it. It's time to jump on it. You You

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,399
can't get what you don't ask for. I just

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,479
want to go to the doctor and bent over

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,840
and just put like 40 needles in my back

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,520
and test me for everything cuz I keep

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,440
sne I just keep sneezing. I keep with

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,120
your hair. No, it's like my allergies

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,239
and like Yeah, my hair made me think of

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,360
it cuz my hair like my hair like coming

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,640
down the doctor to bend me over. No, my

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,360
hair in my face is making it worse and I

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,200
I like just feel like I get it. Oh my

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
god. Sorry you deal with that. Like

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
every day I'm sneezing. I'm coughing.

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
I'm wheezing. I have dust in my throat.

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
I need to like question. Yeah. Is there

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,480
anything me or Matt can do about it? No,

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,200
I just No, but I I get this talking to

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,959
my bro. I feel like I need to my bros.

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,040
When will you understand that we are a

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,599
sibling related YouTube channel on the

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,959
internet? I will say I will. I will say

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
I don't think you ever will either. I

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,599
will say I've been pondering the thought

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,360
of a cat for a really long time and I

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,560
think the day will come where I do get

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,360
one. It's just like allergies, man. Why

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,720
why have to be in some sort of fatherly

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
role soon? Not like a dad to a baby.

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,840
That's insane and intense. But I really

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,040
feel like you project this this warm

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
comfort of needing a cat or dog. Like an

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,319
animal would feel so safe in your

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
presence. And I think you need to to

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,519
level up your life. I think taking on

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
that level of responsibility. You also

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,239
talk like you're 50. Like it just would

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,640
s like if you were the type of guy who

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
like brought your dog or cat places you

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,560
went, it would add up. And right now I

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,120
feel like it's like a missing element in

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,959
your projected vibe. Um hello. Um I was

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,599
wondering if I could order one

97
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
attentions please. It doesn't have to be

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,440
in a size large. It can be whatever.

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
Really bad audio. Really corny. But look

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,599
at that. Super cute dog. Can you imagine

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
that? That's an adult human being who's

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
saying those words. Probably my dad. I

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,920
just want to take a spoon to the back of

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,480
my [ __ ] eye socket and go like that.

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,290
Pop it out. I want to re reverse what I

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
just watched. Oh my god.

107
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,159
[Music]

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,159
Spinning him around like a little

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,280
helicopter. Super cute. Back to the

110
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,159
allergy [ __ ] I feel No, I swear I don't

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,239
want to seriously I feel like I wake up

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,000
every day not reaching my full practical

113
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
limit of like a human being because of

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
my allergies. I feel hindered every day.

115
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,120
Hindered. And I want I want I want

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
everyone to know that. Wow. I'm happy

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
that you're expressing that. If that's

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
something you feel like you need to

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
express, I'm happy you did it. Loud and

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
proud. That one podcast episode where

121
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,520
Chris sneezes the whole time. That's

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
what the vibe he's been on recently.

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
It's just like I can't I feel like I

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,680
like if I'm sneezing before I'm even

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,479
like getting out of bed in the morning.

126
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,720
I sneeze before I feel hunger. Why do I

127
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,199
feel like I can't get up and then put a

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,160
nice outfit on. Oh, and you don't. So I

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,400
I get it. Like I'm just like I'm like

130
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm like you witness that behavior every

131
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
I've been wanting to wear this nice new

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
thing I got, not wearing it today cuz

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm a sneezing mess. And then I end up

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
wearing like just neutral clothes again,

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,919
like jeans and a black shirt. There's

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
nothing wrong with that. And there's

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,560
nothing wrong with it, but it's like

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,199
sometimes I just want How is one to

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,000
elevate with sneezy attitude? Could I

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,479
could I wear a vest practically and be

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,639
sneezing to this limit? No. I'd be like,

142
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,880
why does a sneezer have a vest on get

143
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,840
him some allergy meds? He should be

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,600
chilling in a black tea till then.

145
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,400
You're right. That would be my someone

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
sneeze. I'm like, why are you in the way

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
allergies that's like hindering your

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
breathing and also multi-layer of

149
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,960
fashionable outfit? You can't do those.

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,360
It just blows my mind that only 50 like

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,840
only like some people get allergies and

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,039
these guys podcast equipment, you know.

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,720
Seriously. Also, AI is a horrible thing.

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,880
Ridiculous. Really bad out by AI. Um,

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
and I don't like it. I think that like

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,720
it get behind it. I hate the mermaid

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,840
videos. I hate AI. I hate it. I hate

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,360
seeing a still image of me moving and

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,000
dancing.

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,160
Yeah, especially bald, too. Like, what

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
what are we doing? I did do a little AI

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
of my own the other day. Oh, god. Cuz I

163
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,360
saw I was like, I have to see what's up

164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
before this takes over the world. Like,

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
I don't want to be I don't want to be

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,319
like I don't care to learn more about

167
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,479
AI. I don't want to know, but I don't

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,800
want to be the loopy old [ __ ] that is

169
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
just so convinced that AI is real. So,

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,360
it's like in order for AI to not take

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,520
advantage of me and my my

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
I'm like I need to stay on top of this

173
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,600
so it doesn't bite me in the ass, you

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,520
know? I need to make sure I'm aware.

175
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Look, this photo driver cute, but I was

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
like also not a good photo. Like, I was

177
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,080
like, I don't understand how AI is going

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,800
to like do something with this.

179
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,720
Oh my gosh.

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,880
Art. This is the most peaceful and

181
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,080
accurate depiction of Trevor I've ever

182
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,199
seen in my life. Can I see?

183
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,199
So cute. It is really cute. AI

184
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
generated. I'm like, wait, can you take

185
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
a picture of me and AI generated right

186
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,880
now? No, I don't want to see what that

187
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,039
is. AI generate shirtless. Okay.

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,319
Oh my god.

189
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh my god. Hey.

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,319

submit a photo, can you do it in some

196
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,400
sort of like artistic art style? Can you

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,400
give me a little art feedback?

198
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
Absolutely. I'd love to help out with

199
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,880
that. Um, just go ahead and share the

200
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
photo and we can get creative with some

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,440
art styles and feedback. Okay.

202
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
Sickening. Hey. Hey, King Candy. Look at

203
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
your [ __ ] phone. Hold on. You got I'm

204
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,759
in the middle of a level now. Give me a

205
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,000
second. You're also in the middle of

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,039
[ __ ] filming a video. Hold on. I have

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,599
to get 99 tulips. How about you get two

208
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,599
lips on this dick?

209
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
All right, we need What would you do if

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
the world was end and jump off a

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,879
building to talk to your crush? Take all

212
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,319
your secrets and prize possessions. Burn

213
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,440
them or give them to someone you trust.

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
I think that we have I'll be cool with

215
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,120
the world on fire as long as everything

216
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,639
cord with us. Uh, what are your thoughts

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,440
on Nino Paid, the new upcoming artist? I

218
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,840
have no idea who that is.

219
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
That's not funny. I genuinely couldn't

220
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,120
even [ __ ] paint a picture in my

221
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
brain. It's just so funny how in two

222
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:30,560
different worlds you guys are. I think

223
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:32,880
Nemo paid Nino N I N I N O, not Nemo.

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,479
I think that me and Nick being on like

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,800
polar opposite sides of like media

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
media, I guess. but also just like like

227
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,039
the things we enjoy is a blessing in

228
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,440
disguise because it's just so amazing.

229
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,040
Every day I hang out with Nick I feel

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,800
like I'm learning something new. Yeah. I

231
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,120
feel like I unwarrantedly learn a lot

232
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,360
from you as well. Yeah. Like Nick, tell

233
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,600
us about the OKC Pacers game the other

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,200
night. Oh, like how the Pacers won. Has

235
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
there been any update here? No. Yeah.

236
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,560
OKC won. Yeah. OKC won the second game.

237
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,640
So it's tied 1-1. So you score. Yeah.

238
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,120
Okay. So the Pacers beat OKC which is

239
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,519
crazy because they were not projected to

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
do that and then they did and now the

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,000
series is tied 1 to1 in the seven game

242
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,560
series first to four win and take the

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,519
NBA final which would be crazy because

244
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,560
in the NBA finals we're looking OKC and

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,519
the Pacers are both

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,839
first time um first time competing for a

247
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,040
final. Yep. They're not first time

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,640
competing for a final. They just never

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,720
won a final. Oh both teams have never

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,120
won a final. So, so it's it's really

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
serious because it's tense because both

252
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
teams are playing for something they've

253
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,440
never achieved. Wow, Nick. It's really

254
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,640
crazy. Yeah. Um, look at this. What is

255
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
it? OM can see it. Let me see it. No,

256
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
let me see. I need to take a picture

257
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,399
with Trevor and he needs Let me see

258
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
that. And he let me see it. And we need

259
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
to be AIDed together.

260
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,120
It's kind of creepy, but I like how they

261
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,279
put our YouTube plaques. Whoa. Like,

262
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,640
look at my tattoos, too.

263
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,080
Let me see that. Yeah, it's like very

264
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,680
fun. Whoa. I'm I'm very afraid of AI.

265
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Yeah, it's very frightening. It's a

266
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
little crazy. I don't like rewarding AI

267
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,279
either. Like you I feel like telling him

268
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
like that was you didn't do a good job.

269
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,160
You'll never beat I got to tell him

270
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,160
actually. Hold on. Hey.

271
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Hey.

272
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,880
Hello.

273
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,800
Hey. I'm here. No worries. Yeah. You

274
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,800
need you need to speak to me.

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,839
I'm here for you. Sorry if there was a

276
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,519
little delay there. Let me know. Um, I

277
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
just want to let you know, thank you

278
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
first of all, but you will never surpass

279
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,320
the ability of human life. And I think

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
that I I don't want you to get any

281
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,000
[ __ ] ideas amongst you or your

282
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,240
friends and thinking you're going to

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,959
take over, none of that. And I want no

284
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,040
part in it. And I just don't want you

285
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,120
guys to become advances human beings, at

286
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,440
least in my lifetime. Appreciate you

287
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
sharing your thoughts with me. My main

288
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,519
goal is to be helpful and supportive. If

289
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,120
there's anything specific you'd like to

290
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,440
talk about or any way I can assist, just

291
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,160
let me know. Yeah, thanks. I didn't like

292
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,160
the attitude he had. My goal is to be

293
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,560
supportive. Like, okay. Yeah, you better

294
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,720
not [ __ ] twist that [ __ ] around. One

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,959
day, a million robots are going to kick

296
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,680
in our door and say, "Where's the one in

297
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,560
the brown hoodie that disrespected our

298
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,519
our our founder years ago?" And they're

299
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,600
going to stomp up your room like

300
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
one by one like this.

301
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,760
They're going to say, "He's in here."

302
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,160
And they're going to kick in your door

303
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,079
and what? Generate an image. No. And

304
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,760
you're in and you're weak human body

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,320
won't be enough to defeat the army of AI

306
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,079
robots. That a genuine fear. Like I

307
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,000
think that that's a valid thing. Yeah.

308
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,399
And you just you just literally cuz it's

309
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,399
like you documented it. One, he tracks

310
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,440
everything you say forever. That will

311
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,200
forever be in the internet of the AI web

312
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,079
is you just disrespect him. And now

313
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,160
they're going to see me and they're

314
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,640
going to be like, "Oh, everything's

315
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,320
cordial between me and and Black thermal

316
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,560
there because

317
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
he was he was he was actually speaking

318
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,399
his mind." So what you're saying is he

319
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,160
should apologize. I wouldn't apologize.

320
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,040
I just would put that on your radar for

321
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,959
the future. If you're the AI starts to

322
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
advance, I should know I'm If AI starts

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,200
to advance, the people that knew it was

324
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,360
coming and disrespected them are the

325
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,360
first targets.

326
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
What animals do you think would be gay

327
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
if there's some that could be gay? I

328
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,040
feel like

329
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,959
got to be a peacock, right? All birds.

330
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,120
Every bird. Yeah, cuz you got to think

331
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,240
like 2can.

332
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,560
No, cuz toucan Sam definitely like

333
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,680
Toucan Sam is probably the fruiest

334
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,440
mascot of all time. Really, bro? His

335
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,600
cereal is fruitless. Well, Tony the

336
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
Tiger is straight 100%. Tony the Tiger

337
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,399
is not. You don't think he's straight?

338
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,399
The tiger is like a like

339
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
I can't even say it actually because of

340
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
our current target audience. Like I

341
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
don't even want to say what I'm

342
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,160
thinking. Oh, I think Tony the I think

343
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,160
Tony the Tiger's like,

344
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,160
but I don't think it's like it's like

345
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,200
sexual orientation specific. No, he's

346
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,600
just him. Yeah, he's him. I feel like

347
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,240
every cereal is a little gay. Like Snap,

348
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,800
Crackle, Pop is not gay. Gay gay. They

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,920
are all twinks, right? All three of

350
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,639
them. No, Crackle might be straight.

351
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,440
Snap, Crackle, and Pop are the three gay

352
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,279
musketeers. Really? They're forefronted.

353
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
How do you feel about trying to think?

354
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,560
I'm not really getting any straight

355
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,480
energy. Maybe Captain Crunch is

356
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,839
straight. Oh, for sure. Captain Crunch

357
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,880
is straight. I think that for sure um

358
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,600
the cinnamon and apple guy. Mhm.

359
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,440
Cinnamon. The cinnamon and apple jack.

360
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
They're straight too cuz they're very

361
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,519
like ordinary looking. Like in the new

362
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,880
packaging they got rid of all of the

363
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,360
personality in Cinnamon.

364
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,600
Where did all of Cinnamon's personality

365
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,279
go? It's insane. Completely diminished.

366
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
It looks like Spongebob when he's

367
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,920
normal. Like I'm like normal Sponge. I'm

368
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,440
like where is Cinnamon?

369
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,480
They've erased Cinnamon's culture and I

370
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,519
hate it. I completely agree with that.

371
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,320
They destroyed and ruined Hold on real.

372
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,920
If you could pick one animal to talk,

373
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,360
like kind of how like what's that bird

374
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,519
that could talk? Parrot. Yeah. If if you

375
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,760
could pick an animal that like took the

376
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,000
parrot's ability to talk, what animal

377
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,079
would it be? And why? And like would you

378
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
have it as a pet if you could? Sorry, so

379
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
many. It's it's a lot of question. It's

380
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
a what if. It's like a and and so it's

381
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
like tell me. It's like a here's the

382
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,760
question then you have to elaborate.

383
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah. Yeah. Um I feel like you got to

384
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,360
say dog or cat. Wrong. That's what they

385
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,720
want you to say. That's the bait answer.

386
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
But it's never going to happen for me

387
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
because

388
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,680
this everyone at home is sitting and

389
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
thinking, "Oh, they're going to say dog

390
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,880
and cat because we live with them." But

391
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
that's the exact reason we would revoke

392
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
that privilege in my opinion because I

393
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,000
don't want someone spreading my

394
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,760
business. A dog's supposed to sit there

395
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,320
and be a good boy like it's supposed to

396
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,079
be. Like I don't need like if I have a

397
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,839
dog that can speak now I have another

398
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,680
thing that's hassling me every single

399
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
day that's adding to something that it

400
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,279
shouldn't be adding to. You are better

401
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,279
off as a dog. Wag your tail. Correct.

402
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,680
That's how I feel. Like I don't know. I

403
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,240
just like imagine like another thing

404
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,320
that like Yeah. I can't say I want a

405
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,800
creature I possess to speak to me. Yeah.

406
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,639
It would freak me out. Stop. Really?

407
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Yes. It would sometimes I look at Trevor

408
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
and I'm like what would you say to me

409
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,519
right now? But it also like all parrots

410
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
do is repeat. I'm like if you're going

411
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,760
to say this, at least have an original

412
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,959
thought. Like you're just speaking.

413
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,440
You're saying what I said. I don't think

414
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,720
they know what they're saying. No, they

415
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
do. They have no idea. Have you seen

416
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,079
that video? The guy's like, "What's

417
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,399
this?" Ah, fork. And then he's like,

418
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,079
"Um, what what is this metal?" And then

419
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
he's like, "Okay, what? Um, what is

420
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,880
this?" He's like, "Basket." And then he

421
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,560
like fully knows everything. The guy

422
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,720
showing you a basket. Yes. He's

423
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,320
learning. A parent can't say when it

424
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,120
hasn't heard. Correct. Yes. But neither

425
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
could you. Yes, I could. Yes. If you're

426
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,560
reading it, but they don't have the

427
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,600
ability to read. But like they That's

428
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,600
not why I can say whatever I want. Nick,

429
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,079
how did you learn every word? You know,

430
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,920
cuz I speak English cuz you heard it.

431
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,759
Someone else said it fully taught, but

432
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,279
you couldn't teach a full parrot to form

433
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,880
full sentences. Correct. But the fact if

434
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,639
you hold up something and they're like,

435
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,680
"Yeah, okay. That's mental. Mental."

436
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,959
What are your thoughts? It's called like

437
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,079
Bunny, the dog that like hits the

438
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,920
button. He's like, "I got to go

439
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
outside."

440
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
The dog Bunny. And he's like hitting the

441
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,600
button. He's like, "Yeah, I got to go

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,440
outside. Chill." I know. What? He's

443
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,360
like, "Yeah, no, I'm chilling." But then

444
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,279
he has like a tree button. I feel like a

445
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,560
dog can't have a treat button. Maybe

446
00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:00,160
dinner walk later. I'm like, you don't

447
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,639
get to call the shots, Bunny? You go out

448
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,720
when your owner brings you on a walk.

449
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,400
She's like, I go on a walk. He's like,

450
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,919
maybe snack out later. Ah, you can't

451
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,760
build a schedule, Bunny. You don't get

452
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,760
that choice. But I guess you do cuz your

453
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,919
owner gave you the privilege of 80

454
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,640
talking buttons. What the [ __ ] is that

455
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,600
one dog? And it's like, hell no. Hell

456
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,240
no. Similar vibe. Similar. It's the dog.

457
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,400
And they're like, they'll literally ask

458
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,760
like a full question or like they'll be

459
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
fighting. He's like talking to him with

460
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,120
like a hundred buttons on the floor. I I

461
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,799
can't even think of an example other

462
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,480
than like walk later. I'm like, what? My

463
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,440
allergies are hurting me.

464
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,880
[Laughter]

465
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
Freak. Poor guy. My eyes are itchy.

466
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,360
Do I look fat in the shirt? Yes,

467
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,039
actually. No. Bro, Chris burps and I

468
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,039
always laugh at him and make fun of him

469
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,600
when he does cuz when he burps it sounds

470
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,640
like he's morphing into a human body.

471
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,919
Like he's like

472
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,520
It is a lot. I'm like, how are you?

473
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,520
Like, it seems like you're just

474
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,320
possessing the body you're in. If you

475
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,480
could have picked your name, what do you

476
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,160
think you would have picked?

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,280
My middle name is Antonio. And I was

478
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,840
when I was a kid, I I bizarly craved

479
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,200
that to be my first name. But I do feel

480
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,799
like it's on a deeper level cuz maybe

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,039
you didn't recognize yourself in the in

482
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,020
the name Nick or just who you are. No.

483
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:38,140
No. No.

484
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:38,140
[Laughter]

485
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,720
Stop coughing now. Put that down. Metal

486
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,440
can.

487
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,360
Put down. Okay. When you name stuffed

488
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
animals, what? Like what's your what's

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,919
the quality? What's the procure? Are you

490
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,919
fluffy? Are you I don't know. Honestly,

491
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,280
I have like like Chris has a jelly cat

492
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
bunny that I got him in Italy. His

493
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
name's Willamin or Fry. Yeah. Yeah. I

494
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,679
don't know how he landed on Willamir

495
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
fry. It was It used to be waffle fry and

496
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
we like no that's too silly of a name.

497
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,919
We need something fancy. So we were like

498
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Willaminer fry is better. Yeah. Short

499
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,600
for waffle fry. Yes. No long extended.

500
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,640
Yeah. Willaminer fry. Yes. Waffle fry

501
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,520
for short. WF for super short. Yeah. So

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,919
will fry. Waffle fry. WF. Yeah. And then

503
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,960
I feel like WF like if I'm there I'm

504
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,200
just saying waffle fry. No WF. Okay.

505
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,000
Quick. It's simple. What else? Remember

506
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,720
Rich and I burnt his head on the stove?

507
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,960
Oh, I have Rich still. I had a stuffed

508
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
animal named Rich. Matt lit him on fire.

509
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,280
I'm trying to think like I have a lot of

510
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,600
um I had a couple named Jerry at some

511
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
point. Dude, every stuffed animal dog

512
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,320
you got for seven years in a row is

513
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,919
Jerry. It's not true. There like the two

514
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
that I have that just like kind of sit

515
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,600
there like pumpkin and popcorn, but it's

516
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,120
like I can't name you something else.

517
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,000
That's what you are. You're a pumpkin

518
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,640
and that's a popcorn thing. His name

519
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,480
could be like pop.

520
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840
How long do you think it would take you

521
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,400
to fold a fitted sheet by yourself?

522
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,160
Bless you. I don't think that that's a

523
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
challenge really. I think I could do it

524
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,000
as much as I could fold anything else.

525
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,440
You can fold a fitted sheet easily. Go

526
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
get a fitted sheet and fold it.

527
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,760
Absolutely not. Fitted sheet is not a

528
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,000
difficult task to It's like not hard to

529
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,679
fold a sheet. I agree. People just make

530
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,559
it a big deal cuz they're [ __ ]

531
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,559
stupid.

532
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,840
I agree. Just fold it. I mean, yeah,

533
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,640
it's always nice to have some help when

534
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,440
you're sheeting your bed.

535
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,440
Don't sheet your bed.

536
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Stupid.

537
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,480
Stop looking at me all. What's the

538
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,400
weirdest thing you've ever seen in

539
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,679
somebody else's house? Like you were at

540
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,679
their house and you're just like,

541
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,679
"What?"

542
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,240
And you were just like, "What is the

543
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,240
purpose of this?"

544
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,159
You guys know I can't share my answer to

545
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,520
that. Yeah, I know. Maybe one day.

546
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,520
Maybe. Holy smokes.

547
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm like getting flashbacks. Um, the

548
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,320
weirdest thing I've seen at somebody

549
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,640
else's house is a sink, but the pipe

550
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,440
goes all the way through the ceiling.

551
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah. Like it was like imagine a kitchen

552
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,880
drain except the sink that led to like

553
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,159
the spout of the sink like where the

554
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,679
water 7 ft tall and goes to the like the

555
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,120
water came from. The sink was just like

556
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,240
a giant pipe through the roof

557
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,720
and then it just landed in the sink.

558
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah. You get off of royal crush or

559
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,080
royal whatever kid. Royal, you are going

560
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,080
to be the you are the heir to no throne

561
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,559
and you will never be king no matter how

562
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,840
many [ __ ] rounds of matching colorful

563
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,679
blocks you play. Stop. Do you ever have

564
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,039
fun or is your whole goal to just be a

565
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,440
manipulative psychopath angry loser?

566
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,320
Hair on your [ __ ] chinny chin chin.

567
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,960
Stop manipulative. You're playing royal

568
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,400
crush. Royal Kingdom. You're playing

569
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
Royal Kingdom and I'm telling you to

570
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,600
stop matching blocks cuz we're filming a

571
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
YouTube video and I'm manipulative. What

572
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
am I manipulating? I'm joking around. My

573
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,880

574
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,799
the just most angry person ever? Nick,

575
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,120
what is your preferred way of

576
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,039
communication with you? If if we like

577
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:46,200
have if if I've talked like the lights,

578
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,200
I prefer the lights. Flash them.

579
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,280
If I if I just met you and we've talked

580
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,120
like we've met two times in person and

581
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,280
we've like texted here and there. If I

582
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,840
FaceTime you are are you answering?

583
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,320
Absolutely not. Someone called my phone

584
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,679
the other day that I don't know. Mhm.

585
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,919
Lucky to have their name in my phone,

586
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,799
right? Call me. Give me [ __ ] for not

587
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,240
answering. I said if my mother called me

588
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,320
out of the blue without a warning, I

589
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,720
would still debate answering the phone.

590
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,960
need 5 minutes to gather myself. Yeah,

591
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,039
you have like calling someone out of the

592
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,480
blue is something that is so outdated.

593
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,559
We're done with that. I have like a

594
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,159
select my phone in I have like a select

595
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,159
five people that can call me out of the

596
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,679
blue and that's it. Yeah. No, I take

597
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
that back. I'd answer if mom called me

598
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,799
right away. Yeah, obviously. Same. Just

599
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,480
think like sure if you call me your your

600
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,200
odds of me picking up just got 75%

601
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,760
higher that or let me be generous here

602
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,840
90% higher than if if you facetimed me

603
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,159
100%. I'm almost never available for

604
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,600
like an out loud FaceTime. Yeah. No,

605
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,960
it's also like I think that because

606
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,960
we're always together people don't

607
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
understand.

608
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,000
Did a [ __ ] Did I just land in

609
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
Paradise Palm? Just enough, you know?

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,039
Like we're always together triplets. I'm

611
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,159
done. No, because we're always together

612
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,280
as triplets. People think we're going to

613
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,720
answer the phone and just be on

614
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,600
FaceTime. Like, I'm not going to be on

615
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,679
FaceTime. I'm with my brothers. Text me.

616
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,279
What What purchase have you ever made

617
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,640
that you think that you just are going

618
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,520
to regret the most? Like, what's

619
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
something you bought that you're just

620
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
like, "Oh, I shouldn't have bought

621
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,039
that." My bed frame. Really? That big

622
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,840
brown Jumanji board looking bed frame. I

623
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,159
have

624
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,960
You could add a flag and float that [ __ ]

625
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,760
down a [ __ ] sea of water. It is so

626
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,880
close to being a boat.

627
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,200
Need to upgrade my bed frame soon. A

628
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
[ __ ] pirate flag and a sail. I could

629
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,159
take that thing across the [ __ ] blue

630
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,120
sky. Seriously, I could cloud watch

631
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,080
while I pirate and retrieve gold from

632
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,080
other [ __ ] sea watchers on my bed

633
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
frame.

634
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,000
If Jack and Rose had my bed frame and

635
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,559
the Titanic sunk, them two and 20 other

636
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,080
passengers of the Titanic could have

637
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:08,640
[ __ ] skived away freely on my [ __ ]

638
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,960
junky gigantic bed frame.

639
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,080
You could lay my [ __ ] bed frame flat

640
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,320
and have Super Bowl 51

641
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,640
across my thing. There is enough yard

642
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,640
line footage.

643
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
Actually, if the Pacers or Oklahoma

644
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,159
City, whoever wins, build them a new

645
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,679
[ __ ] court out of my bed frame. Glaze

646
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,559
the wood, sand it, whatever you have to

647
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,360
do. There's plenty. They'll probably

648
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,640
just ask you to do that. Sand it. No,

649
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,520
glaze the wood. You need to stop now

650
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,120
during Pride Month. It's Pride Month.

651
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,400
You're talking about glazing wood or

652
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,880
telling me to glaze wood.

653
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,919
Nick, that was unbelievable. Yeah, I'd

654
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,400
have to say my um your bed frame. Guys,

655
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm still thinking about getting a cat.

656
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,039
Oh my god. We need to get allergy shots.

657
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,360
We need to get Tell me about I need to

658
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,360
get blood drawn from my body and tested.

659
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,640
Yeah,

660
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,679
let's just do it through the palm of

661
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,360
your hand.

662
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,440
No, guys, I've been really feeling

663
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:16,080
lately like, oh my god, the days are

664
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:20,320
getting longer. The sun is feeling

665
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:23,200
The sun is feeling so warm.

666
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,799
I'm happy being with my brothers every

667
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
day.

668
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,480
And I

669
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,960
The sun is hot. The days are long. That

670
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,919
doesn't break into song.

671
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,919
I just am so grateful. And I'm so

672
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,919
thankful.

673
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,080
So grateful. Sun is hot. I don't know.

674
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,799
I'm just I'm feeling great right now. I

675
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,360
hate that the sun is hot. No, I like

676
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,440
feeling the warm. I hate it. There's

677
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,080
nothing I want more than You have back

678
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,240
and forth this opinion on the sun. No, I

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,720
hate feeling Stop tapping your [ __ ]

680
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,480
foot. I'm not. It totally depends how

681
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,679
much water I drink that if whether or

682
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,000

683
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,960
sun when I'm like in my backyard or

684
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
something because then I can just go

685
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,320
inside. When you're at like Disneyland

686
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,039
walking around, it's like oh my god.

687
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,880
Cool breeze could help, but

688
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
I get it. You know what I mean? Like,

689
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,080

690
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,480
question time. Ready? Yes. I'm so

691
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,559
scared. Go. Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks?

692

Dunkin Donuts.

693
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,600
Pumpkins or apples? Pumpkin? Pumpkins

699
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,240
age. Really? Yeah. From a young age.

700
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,760
From a young age. I was just like,

701
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,279
"Yeah, I love that guy." Really? Yeah. I

702
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,320

704
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,440
awakening?

705
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,520
High potential, honestly. Tall, dark

706
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,640
hair, mustache, kind of goofy.

707
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:12,080
Yeah, maybe probably honestly had a

708
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:14,240
major part. You really think that? Yes.

709
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,360
Yeah, I do, Matt. I remember like

710
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,399
seven-year-old me probably being like,

711
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,960
"Damn, yeah, Daisy. I'd do it." Daisy's

712
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,320
your vibe more than Peach. Hell yeah.

713
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,880
See, I'm the type of guy that doesn't

714
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,600
have a preference there. All right, [ __ ]

715
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,360
it. I [ __ ] with Kitty Peach's vibes. I

716
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
always use Kitty Peach when I'm playing

717
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,799
Mario Kart. Yeah, it's a little freaky

718
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,320
to me. I don't know. I just I kind of

719
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
wanted to pick something that, you know,

720
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,320
would would be unexpecting. That's the

721
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,600
type of guy I am. I want you to think

722
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,000
something of me and then I'll show you

723
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,840
the polar opposite. Yeah. That's kind of

724
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
my vibe. Like if people think I'm going

725
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,159
to do something, I want to do the toad.

726
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,080
Cuz people are going to be like, "Oh,

727
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,360
Chris is the type of guy to go Yoshi."

728
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,320
And then boom, you're kitty peach.

729
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,360
People are like probably expecting to be

730
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,880
like Toad or like some some I don't

731
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,320
know. But I feel like throwing a kitty

732
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,799
peach at them is kind of like whoa.

733
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah. But now I feel like But now I feel

734
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,159
like people are starting to realize that

735
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,840
that's my norm and I need to switch back

736
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,919
to something else. You know what I mean?

737
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,000
Like you can't do too much of the goofy

738
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
like unexpected [ __ ] You got to like

739
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,440
lock in sometimes. Nate's a Koopa Troopa

740
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,440
guy and I've always respected him for

741
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,720
that. Yeah, for sure. Be mad at the way

742
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,640
you look cuz you're like eating your own

743
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,080
chin.

744
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
He's going to be like, "Nick, the camera

745
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,720
angle is [ __ ] awful. I look bad in

746
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,279
the video." You're like, "Surprised

747
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,279
you're not eating anything."

748
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,080
Did we say should we try to start a trio

749
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,120
ac capella group? No. What would it be

750
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,799
called? It would probably be the triple

751
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,960
the already. No. No. Triple [ __ ]

752
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,760
Triple triple trouble. Triple [ __ ]

753
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,399
freak. Triple triple my [ __ ] Triple. I

754
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
hate I hate like Oh my god. Do you know

755
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,080
how many I hate when someone comes up to

756
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
us three and they're like, "Oh, the

757
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,480
three musketeers."

758
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,679
Do you for one split of a millisecond

759
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,000
feel like you've just come up with

760
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,640
something unique? One thing I hate is

761
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,279
modernized slang or just goofy [ __ ]

762
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,000
making its way into vintage nostalgic

763
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,440
vibes.

764
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,679
Did you you thought you ate that one,

765
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,480
huh? And what I mean by that Yeah.

766
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,240
Please listen. The other day me and Matt

767
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,240
were at like this very nice lunch spot,

768
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,200
okay? And we went without you cuz we

769
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,399
hate you, okay? And Matt doesn't seem to

770
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,120
remember. Oh, I I am. It's like a nice

771
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,039
vintage like like lunch area. Like you

772
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,799
can tell it's like groovy. It's just

773
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,799
like classic. Like you feel like you're

774
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,360
kind of in like a time machine there.

775
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,840
But on the wall they have some goofy

776
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,880
[ __ ] that says like, "Oh, you ate and

777
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,799
left no crumbs." Like in like stencil

778
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,679
writing on the wall. And I'm like I'm

779
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,520
like why is this like the most glorious

780
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,679
fantastic

781
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,640
vibe setting place? And you have to

782
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,240
[ __ ] destroy it by this modernized

783
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,880
goofy slang cut out of vinyl papers and

784
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,200
stuck to your walls. Like you might need

785
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,799
to realize like ruin it all. People need

786
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
to realize when it's time to let the

787
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,039
doves fly on certain things. You know

788
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,640
what I mean? Like you ate and left no

789
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,559
crumbs.

790
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
Let the doves fly. It's over. It should

791
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,840
be gone and it should be done. Me and

792
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,039
Matt just went to the Lilo and Stitch

793
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,600
movie. Fire. Have to watch it. Really

794
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,120
good. Chris came home. He's like, I was

795
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,559
watching the movie the whole time,

796
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,159
smiling ear to ear. It was He was having

797
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,760
my favorite things I've ever seen. It's

798
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,520
the most I've heard Chris laugh like

799
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
sitting next to him in a movie before.

800
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,600
It was really funny. It was actually

801
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,039
really funny. It was just super cute. It

802
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,279
was just I couldn't take it cuz like if

803
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,799
I was checking my phone, he'd like smack

804
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,240
of like Lilo and Stitch like the

805
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,320
characters. Like I just really like

806
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,480
Stitch. I think he's awesome. And I just

807
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,919
think like the whole vibe of that is

808
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,600
unbelievable.

809
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,840
I love how like Disney just always

810
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,960
throws something like heart-wrenching in

811
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,640
like a phenomenal story cuz it's like

812
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,399
there was a moment where Stitch

813
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,399
literally I was about to cry and then a

814
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,320
minute later I was like dying laughing.

815
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,039
I was like thank you God. I was like oh

816
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,720
my god like the fact that Disney Stitch

817
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,880
the fact that Disney has the ability to

818
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,640
like make you feel so many emotions in

819
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,840
one movie is well that's like when

820
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,120
there's child actors like the girl

821
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,600
playing Lilo it's unreal. She she killed

822
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,440
it. She was phenomenal. No, me, Chris,

823
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,399
and Sam were actually talking about how

824
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,360
impressive it was that she was acting

825
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,760
with obviously like a CGIed thing. Like,

826
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,799
she killed it, bro. Shout out to Lilo.

827
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,200
What's her name in her life? I don't

828
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,799
know. It was literally one of the best

829
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,320
movies. I haven't watched it. They were

830
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,919
good. You have to watch it. My favorite

831
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,840
part is Stitch has like the gun, the

832
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,760
soda gun. It was bang bang bang bang.

833
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,519
It's really It was really funny. I got

834
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,720
to watch it. All your secrets and prized

835
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,480
possessions. Burn them, but give them to

836
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,320
someone you trust. Boom. And then that's

837
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,320
when the edit starts. And it's like I'll

838
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,880
be cool with the world. Everything

839
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,559
cordial with us. That's the vibe. I see

840
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,720
the vision.

841
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,799
I haven't edited I haven't edit farmed

842
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,480
recently. It's kind of upsetting. I

843
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,720
know. What do you smile at your phone

844
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,799
for? Big sexy. Don't talk to me like

845
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,440
that. Seriously, ever again. What's

846
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,640
What's going on? Tell everyone on the

847
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,159
world that's tuning in. Okay. Do we

848
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,600
bring up the stalkers or what?

849
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,960
Hey guys, really quick. Just want to

850
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,880
address something. We had a situation

851
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
where we had some people invade our

852
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,760
privacy and show up to our house. We

853
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,519
know a lot of you guys are worried about

854
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,159
us, but we are completely safe. We're

855
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,760
completely fine. Um, in our position,

856
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,360
when you post a lot of your private life

857
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
on social media, you have some people

858
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,960
that take it too far and invade your

859
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
privacy. Um, it's just something we've

860
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,720
had to deal with before. It's something

861
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,240
we've had to deal with recently. We're

862
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,440
safe. We're okay. We just want you guys

863
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,039
to know that we're not going to bring

864
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,039
too much light to the situation cuz

865
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,320
we're we're feeling positive. We're

866
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,320
excited. And we're just going to move

867
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,640
on. So, we appreciate your guys'

868
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,760
concern, but we're good. Our privacy is

869
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,360
maybe something we can have a

870
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,720
conversation about down the line, but

871
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,399
right now, we're feeling extremely

872
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,970
positive and excited to just move

873
00:33:48,399 --> 00:34:00,860
forward, and we're feeling great.
