1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,040
Next into the Shark Tank is Joe Moore

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,880
with a unique solution to protect

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
against germs and allergens.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,040
Hi, my name is Joe Moore. I am the

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,119
president and CEO of the First Defense

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,199
Nascreen Corporation and I'm seeking

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,439
$500,000 for 10% of my company. Every

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,080
day, people flood emergency rooms,

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,640
doctor's offices, andarmacies seeking

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
relief from inhaling contaminated air.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,280
And one out of every five commercials on

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,600
TV today is about the treatment of nasal

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,320
allergies. That's why I invented First

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,320
Defense nasal screens.

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
First Defense nasal screens are the

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
first and only lightweight,

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
non-inserted, almost non-visible nasal

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
screen ever invented. And they have been

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,399
clinically proven to reduce the

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,520
inhilation of allergens, pollins,

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,320
pollutions, pet danders, molds, viruses,

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,520
and more by up to 99%.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,760
And the next time you're faced with

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,960
unhealthy, contaminated air, remember,

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,080
don't get sick. Just peel and stick.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,080
Thank you. Any questions?

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:20,560
Are you kidding me? Um

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,479
um I'm I I'm I'm not um I just know that

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,360
like I said how big this really is.

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,119
$500,000 for 10% of the company. How

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,360
many have you sold?

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,920
Actually, right now about 1.7 million.

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,720
1.7 million units or 1.7 million in

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
total sales?

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
1.7 million units.

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
And let's just sell them for

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,439
wholesale was 60.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
So your sales last year were how much,

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,479
Joe? Actually, we just we're not we

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
haven't gone to market yet.

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,000
Sorry, I'm confused. If you haven't gone

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
to market, how have you sold 1.7

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
million?

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
Um, actually, we have one big client out

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
of the United Arab Emirates that has

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
actually put in their first order and

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
given us a contract for 8 million over

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
the next six years.

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
So, you have an order for $8 million?

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Right now?

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
Yes, sir. Matter of fact,

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
I have the contract right here.

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
That's a prepared man right there. Good

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,920
for you.

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Thank Well, all of a sudden, you don't

57
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
look that funny with that stuff stuck up

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
your nose. Can I see that?

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
Yes, you can.

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,760
You know, you don't sound like the bozo

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
I thought you were. Is this a product

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
that perhaps is is going to be very

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,640
popular in other societies where face

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
masks are more prominent than they're

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
here stateside?

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,440
Definitely. This is a worldwide product

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,840
cuz I mean, you know, you're wearing

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
them right now. I can see them. It's

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
probably an issue for many people that

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
are going to look at that and say, "What

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
do you got stuck up your nose?"

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
May I see the actual product?

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,760
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,599
I'm sorry, Robert.

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
The distributor guarantees that he'll

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,760
order one, Am I reading this correctly?

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
1,500,000

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,560
sets.

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,599
Yes, sir. That's for Saudi Arabia alone.

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,519
They've already ordered those.

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
And how much is he guaranteeing you?

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,560
Uh, he's guaranteeing me the 8 million

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
over the next um six years.

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
How does the filter work?

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
Basically, how the filter works is as

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
you breathe in, it's a nonwoven

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
material, so it closes and as you

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,159
breathe out, it flushes itself. So, to

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
stop viruses, bacterial elements. It

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
does.

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,000
What's to stop you from taking the germs

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
in through your mouth?

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
That's a great question. 90% of the air

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
we breathe goes through our nasal

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
passages. Also, viruses do not grow in

96
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,280
the mouth, the esophagus, or line of the

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
stomach. They grow in the nasal passage.

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,800
Is there a patent that protects this?

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
Yes, sir. I have we are patent pending

100
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,440
in the United States, Canada, and

101
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
Europe, and have been for three years.

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
And what would you use the money for?

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
The money for right now is so that I can

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
keep producing it because of the raw

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
materials I have to buy up front. So

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,720
basically, you need the 500,000 to make

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,519
the order.

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
Correct.

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
Okay. Tell me if I'm putting these in

110
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,159
right. So I just take it.

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,159
The best way to do it, put it on your

112
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,480
finger like a contact, touch your nasal

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
passage, slide it around the outside,

114
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
slide it around the inside.

115
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Joe, let me ask you a question. Why not

116
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
just go license it to one of the big

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,720
drug companies?

118
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
Um, because I I I did that originally. I

119
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
went to one of the biggest in the United

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,360
States and they told me we were actually

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
a competitor and if they took the

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
product they would shelf it because why

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
would they prevent it for a dollar when

124
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
they could treat it for 14.

125
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,159
How much money have you put into this? I

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
mean

127
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,040
we have almost $1 million into this.

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,959
And where' that money come from?

129
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,959
Um about 600,000 of it was mine. The

130
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,199
rest is from friends and family. I think

131
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
I'd have a very hard time understanding

132
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,520
at all what the product is about unless

133
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
you had these big photos with the noses

134
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
and unless you're standing there

135
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
pitching it because I think the cost of

136
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,320
educating people is the big kahuna here.

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,320
Joe, based on that, I'm out.

138
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Okay.

139
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm intrigued. I got to tell you, let me

140
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,320
throw an offer out to you. I'll give you

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,120
the 500,000. And I want a 15% royalty on

142
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
every unit sold until I recoup my

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
$500,000.

144
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay. Just the royalty, no equity.

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
Are you kidding? Of course I want the

146
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,960
equity. I took the risk. Now, here's my

147
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,960
equity. I want 20%.

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,199
You have an offer for me. What do you

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,479
want to do?

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,400
Um, I would definitely like to hear what

151
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
everybody else has to say. They're not

152
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
interested. They never told me they were

153
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
out

154
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
because of their silence. You know

155
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
they're not interested.

156
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,479
Not necessarily true.

157
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,440
Not necessarily true.

158
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,440
We can work together on this.

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
Okay. You got a deal?

160
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,700
Yeah.

161
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,759
I like that.

162
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,440
[Music]

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,440
I like how cuddly they are, but I want

164
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:41,039
to give you $800,000 for 30%

165
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,039
with 10% royalty.

166
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,800
Oh, come on.

167
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,960
Screw that. I'll give you a million

168
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,759
dollars for the whole company right now.

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,080
I can appreciate uh and I appreciate the

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,400
offer. I really do. But um I would

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
definitely

172
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
You just turned down a million dollars.

173
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Yes, sir.

174
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
I I I I couldn't take a million dollars.

175
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
I know that this is a billion dollar

176
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
industry.

177
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,560
Is there a number you would take

178
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
to sell the whole company?

179
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
Not without a royalty, no. With the

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
royalty, very possibly. Yes.

181
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,600
What's the royalty?

182
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
I believe that with the statistics and

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,560
the research we've done, the royalty

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
would have to be 10%.

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
Wow.

186
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,919
And then what's the number on the

187
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,600
company?

188
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,720
I I would like to stay part of it. Be

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,479
honest with you, because it's my

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
passion. I I'm going to show you

191
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,800
something. I am a cancer I am a I am a

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
cancer survivor. I am a cancer survivor

193
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
by the time I was 19 years old. I've

194
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
been through the army. I've been through

195
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,000
the Marine Corps. I've been halfway

196
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
around the world. I fought all my life

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
and doing different things. I believe in

198
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
this more than anything else because

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
I've gotten testimonials of people say,

200
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,120
"You've changed my life. You've changed

201
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,360
the quality of my life.

202
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll give you a million dollars. I want

203
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,080
30% of the company. Also 10% royalty

204
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,680
until I recoup the money.

205
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Joe, I'll give you $2 million for the

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,680
whole business and the 10% royalty you

207
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,680
asked for back to you.

208
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
I just love this whole thing. We're

209
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,759
about to make you a millionaire just

210
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
like that.

211
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
But I I I have three offers that I'm

212
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
kind of confused. I'd like to have them

213
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,599
a little bit more clear if I can.

214
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,639
The first offer was $500,000

215
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,720
for 20% equity. You're still the 80%

216
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,199
owner. and my partner Mark and I apply a

217
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,240
15% royalty just till we get our

218
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,280
$500,000 back. That's all. Then that

219
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,560
royalty, excuse me, before you start,

220
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
let me finish with one thought that's

221
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
going to stick in the back of your mind.

222
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,840
There's only two sharks here that have

223
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
ever sold a company for over a billion

224
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,039
dollars. I'm one, Cuban's the other guy.

225
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,000
All right, it's billions B. Everybody

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,759
else is an M. Millions. Small, big, big

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,960
difference. You want the billion-dollar

228
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,800
partners, not the small fry.

229
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
I've sold billions. I've sold billions

230
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
of dollars worth of product and still

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,039
doing it now, actually in Asia right

232
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,520
now. So, I have the offer of $1 million,

233
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,560
30% of the company and the same royalty

234
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,479
fee, but less than theirs, 10% royalty

235
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
until I'm recoup the money.

236
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,440
Joe, a fundamentally first difference in

237
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,400
the three offers is one is to sell your

238
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,120
whole business. My offer is $2 million

239
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,199
for the entire business. You get a 10%

240
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,639
royalty. You're the guy that runs it.

241
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
Any interest in selling the entire

242
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,319
business today, which is the road that

243
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm trying to go down.

244
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,960
Not for $2 million.

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,959
Would you go to 4 million?

246
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Um,

247
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,600
I would consider taking the very first

248
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,080
deal you were offered.

249
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,120
You own 80% of the company. We only get

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,200
20. All right. We're not pigs. We're

251
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,600
sharks. We just want our money back.

252
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Is is is is that your final offer?

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
But think about it. We're leaving you

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,279
with 80% of the upside. So, you're going

255
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
to make a lot more than $4 million down

256
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,920
the road with us as partners.

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,760
I understand that. I understand. That's

258
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
why I I I haven't said yes. That's why

259
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm

260
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
Joe. Are you going to sell this business

261
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,440
today or not?

262
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:21,200
Possibly. Very possibly. I believe that

263
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,399
um the 4 million is a little low,

264
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,680
but I think we're very close.

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,600
Um, I think if you went to $5 million

266
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
and 15%

267
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,320
and whether you want me as an employee,

268
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
which I would really like to to do as an

269
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,360
employee contract because I want my

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,480
royalty to be as much as I can. I can

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,480
get my mind around the four.

272
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,200
I can't go up to the five,

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,399
so I'm out.

274
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,519
Dang.

275
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
Listen, would you excuse us for a

276
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,240
moment?

277
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Okay.

278
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,000
So, listen. It's a very simple

279
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,959
discussion amongst us.

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Very often, the best strategy is to take

281
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
a competitor like you, even though

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
sometimes I find it distasteful. I say

283
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,240
bring him into the deal at our price.

284
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,279
Get him back out of this.

285
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,959
What do you think, DJ?

286
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,160
Uh, but we need to go up on the equity.

287
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,760
You guys wanted 20%.

288
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,959
That's interesting. Five, bring them in

289
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,320
for a third and go up to 20%.

290
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,440
No, no. I I think you gave away the

291
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,600
farm. You You It was so unclike when you

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
said 15% only until we get our money

293
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
back.

294
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
Once we bring Damon into our tent, we

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,959
we're the only offer left. We can change

296
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,959
our deal. So, what do you want to do?

297
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,880
Okay, before you say anything, you know,

298
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
the currents constantly change in the

299
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,120
rough waters of the shark tank. That's

300
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,480
why I love this place. Your enemies

301
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,920
become your friends. Your friends are

302
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
become your enemies. And sometimes they

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
bite you in the high and sometimes they

304
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,240
don't. So, what's happened is Damon has

305
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,240
decided to join Mark and I into one

306
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,920
offer. Now, it's great news for you

307
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,000
because there's going to be more money.

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,000
But I'm going let my partner Mark

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,760
explain exactly how great it is for you.

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Okay. So, what we're going to do is

311
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,320
raise our offer to $750,000

312
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,480
and then we're going to ask for 30% of

313
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,959
the company and a 10% perpetual royalty.

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,959
That's our offer.

315
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
Um, I would consider your offer. I would

316
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
The only thing I would ask you to do is

317
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,399
if you go to 1.2 million for the simple

318
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
reason that will give me enough to fill

319
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
my first order. We don't have to do that

320
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,120
because if we own a piece of the

321
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
company, we're your partners and we have

322
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
to finance it, but we don't have to pay

323
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
for it right now.

324
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
If you need more money to fund new

325
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,279
orders and grow the company, you think

326
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
we're going to let our equity disappear

327
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,079
because we couldn't fund a new order. Of

328
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,920
course not. So, you get us without

329
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,680
giving up any more equity with this

330
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,760
deal.

331
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
Don't sell yourself short.

332
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,079
Joe, listen.

333
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,640
Joe, you got to say yes or no.

334
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,360
Life is like business. It's 20% what

335
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,240
happens to you and 80% how you respond.

336
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,600
You have a moment right now to take this

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,600
deal. Will you take it?

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
Does it come with season tickets?

339
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,000
Absolutely.

340
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,480
Then you got a deal.

341
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,880
Amen.

342
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,680
I didn't know you.

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
Congratulations.

344
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
Appreciate it. Looking forward to

345
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,680
working together.

346
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
Absolutely.

347
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
Thank you.

348
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,040
Good job.

349
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
Thank you. Great job. Pleasure meeting

350
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,240
you.

351
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,839
Think about that. That's remarkable. I

352
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
just offered a guy $4 million, which is

353
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,240
about as high as

354
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,639
That's the beauty of the show. This guy

355
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,720
we've never seen before walked in and

356
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,519
had the choice to be a millionaire

357
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,279
and he stuck with it.

358
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
And he stuck to his guns and he believed

359
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,279
in himself. That's what makes this

360
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,360
country great.

361
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,160
I feel warm and fuzzy. I just made some

362
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
money.

363
