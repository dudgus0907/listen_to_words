00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm like hm I think if couples Nick what

129
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,320
I'm thinking if couples were making out

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,360
outside I think they expect them they

131
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,120
expect themselves to be like this is us

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,400
this is us like out on the street we're

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
here I think that more people instead of

134
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,600
being gross out being like Oh what are

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,960
they doing when you see a couple making

136
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,440
out you go like

137
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,080
this stare into their soul okay and

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,080
don't look away and then if they stop

139
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,400
kissing and they like look around I want

140
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,919
you to look at them like

141
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,919
this don't break eye contact at all just

142
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,560
if people are making out outside why

143
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,360
stare at them why think of how awkward

144
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,400
it'd be you're making out with somebody

145
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,919

146
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,039
making out with somebody on a bench in

147
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,520
public you're thinking oh there's no

148
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,600
consequences to these actions you turn

149
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,039

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
