it yes s right here no you already

768
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:55,519
passed the

769
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,200
corner what are you talking what are you

770
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,960
looking for the park on the corner you

771
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200

772
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,080
need to be pulled over what's your goal

773
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,399
at there was there was a public trash

774
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,120
bin at the corner that I was going to

775
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,120
utilize oh I didn't if you told me if

776
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,760
you said pull over at the trash can I

777
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,440
thought the corner was subjective of

778
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,440
like the corner of the road the corner

779
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,919
is usually where two angles meet exactly

780
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,799
what the [ __ ] I meant no I get that but

781
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,440
I didn't think you actually wanted to be

782
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,399
exactly where the corner met say I never

783
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,159
say something I don't 100% mean all

784
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,080
