1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
Copywriting is either the easiest job in

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,759
the world or the hardest job in the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,360
world. So to me, the main difference

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,040
between fine copy and good copy is

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,320
what's the emotion. I think the biggest

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
mistake that happens when you're

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,720
creating brands is that sometimes people

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,880
think it's like logo type color, but

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,520
realistically there's so much more. I

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
see a ton of ads, especially in the AI

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
space, that are all about efficiency.

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
And I just think it's ridiculous. You

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,640
could stop a thousand people on the

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,920
street and ask them what they want in

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,079
life and no one is going to say, "I

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,120
really wish I was more efficient." I am

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,120
Mike Smith. I run uh Smith and Diction

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
with my wife Cara in the beautiful Bach

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,719
building in Philadelphia. Smith

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
Andiction is a design studio. We mainly

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
focus on creating thoughtful identities

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,559
for imaginative clients. We work on

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,239
companies like Perplexity, Gamma,

24
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,079
Exposure, and Anterior. Just anything

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
that feels really, really unique. I'm

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,800
Cara Smith and I run Smith and Addiction

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
with my husband Mike. I run most of the

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,399
addiction side of what we do. So I

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
oversee all of our STR brand strategy

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
and messaging and copywriting. Our

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,600
approach is pretty different in that

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
we're small. We're intentionally a small

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,280
team. So everyone we work with works

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
directly with us. Mike and I are the

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,600
founders and we also lead the project.

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
So at a traditional big agency, the

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,960
people who are started the company, the

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
people who run the company, they're not

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
the ones actually doing the work.

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,200
They're not the people doing the writing

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,520
and doing the design. And here that's

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
the opposite. So we are not only the

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,400
people who started the company and who

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,920
run the company, but we also are the

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
people doing a majority of the work. So

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
I handle a lot of the copywriting and

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,159
strategy myself. Mike leads all of the

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
design along with his team. So you just

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
get so much more connection between the

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,759
people who we're working with, our

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,360
partners, our clients, and our team

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,600
because we're just the lynch pin between

53
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
those

54
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,399
two. Everybody has a brand. Brand is

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,159
simply how people see you, right? So

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,159
whether you spend a lot of time and

57
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
money developing a brand or you don't,

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
like Mike was talking about, like our

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
favorite bagel shop where it's just a

60
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
bag and it's like a Sharpie on a paper

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
bag, that is still a brand even though

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
there was no money spent on that brand.

63
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,319
And it's letting people know we do not

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
care about design. We only care about

65
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,959
making the best bagels in this city. and

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
you're conveying that through that

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
medium even even if you didn't spend a

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,720
single dime on that. And I think the

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
thing that a lot of people miss about

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,239
brand is that if you choose not to

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
invest in it, you still have one. People

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,400
will see you in a certain way. If you

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,000
have a social media ad, then you you

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
have an avatar. And what does that look

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
like and what does that tell people

76
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,000
about you? So, I like to think that what

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,920
we do is we just help you understand

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
what your brand is and you be in control

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
of your brand instead of letting your

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,640
audience decide your brand because

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
you're not quite aware or you don't have

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
a handle on it. So, and I think that's

83
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,400
one of those things that when we give

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
you a brand toolkit, that's not the end

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
of the conversation, right? Like

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
branding as an exercise doesn't mean

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
like it's not a thing that you buy and

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,840
then like great, I bought my brand. A

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
brand is what you do every single day.

90
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
Every single interaction you have is a

91
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,319
part of your brand. every single

92
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,720
customer service conversation, every

93
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,560
single uh moment that somebody spends in

94
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
your platform on your product if you're

95
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
a client like Gamma, those are all part

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,040
of your brand and we just give you the

97
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040
tools at the beginning to say, "Okay,

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
here's here's how you can create a brand

99
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,080
that will reach your audience. Here's

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
the toolkit." And then you have to go

101
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
out and you have to live that brand and

102
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
be that brand every single day. So

103
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,760
that's my like speech of like brand, you

104
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,040
can't just like buy a brand. brand is

105
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
how people see you. And how people see

106
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
you will continue to change with

107
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,120
everything that you do and every

108
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
interactions that they have. And you can

109
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
choose whether those interactions are

110
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,239
better and better and they're more and

111
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,760
more interested in being in your club or

112
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,040
whether every time they interact with

113
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
your customer service, they have a worse

114
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
and worse impression of your brand. And

115
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,519
then it doesn't matter how much money

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
you spend on design if your customer

117
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
service team isn't delivering on the

118
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
qualities that your brand is conveying.

119
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
Branding to me is just like what would

120
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,480
you put a sticker on your car or your

121
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
notebook or your laptop? Like a good

122
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,400
brand is one of those things that exists

123
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
more than just a a transaction. It's

124
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
something that becomes part of your

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,480
life. And I think that when you are

126
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,159
creating a brand, it's so easy to think

127
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,319
transactional. It's so easy to be like,

128
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,519
"Oh, I want people to download this

129
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,880
product or I want people to use this uh

130
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,600
this, you know, menu or something, but I

131
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,199
want people to want to live their life

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,680
with that brand as part of their mental

133
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,840
kind of like ecosystem." For me, the

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
Vulc logo, when I was growing up

135
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,800
skateboarding, I drew that logo on

136
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,040
everything, every book, every year,

137
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
every class. I I was just so obsessed

138
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,680
with how beautiful and simple it was. So

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
to me, I think that a brand is just

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,680
something that like it pulls you in.

141
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,000
It's almost like a gem or a crystal that

142
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
you're just like you can't help but want

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
to be near or can't help but you want to

144
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
hold it. When you look at some of the

145
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
brands we've made, I try to always make

146
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
them have a little bit of tangible

147
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,199
quality to them. Uh so people can

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,440
actually feel like they can reach out

149
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,080
and grab it or it could sit on your desk

150
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,680
as like this really cool paper weight or

151
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,080
something like that. Why is branding

152
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,400
important for business for like products

153
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
and things like that? I think that

154
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,520
branding is important in that use case

155
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,680
because it's the easier and easier it

156
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
gets to make stuff the more that brand

157
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
will actually make things that people

158
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,039
want to have in their lives. When you

159
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
have a product or something like you

160
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,800
know I open Instagram every day like

161
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,000
every single day I am influenced by the

162
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,080
AI or the the UI in that product. it

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,360
would be a disservice to not treat

164
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
people with the with the respect of like

165
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,520
you care about what's in their hand.

166
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,759
when you're kind of invading people's

167
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
lives, the least you can do is is

168
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,440
respect the the attention that they are

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,720
giving you uh and making a product or a

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,560
UI or whatever a brand that feels like

171
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
it's actually making their life better

172
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,880
or making their life easier or making

173
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
their life more fun or they're smiling

174
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,479
when they open the app or something like

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,720
that because there are so many things

176
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,720
that want to take away your energy and

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,440
take away your happiness that like I

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
feel like it's brand's job or It's a

179
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,600
brand's job to make you feel a little

180
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
bit better, but it doesn't work like

181
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
that. Doesn't work like that as much

182
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
anymore. To me, I think the biggest

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
mistake that and I don't even know if

184
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,840
it's founders. I think the biggest

185
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,919
mistake that happens when you're

186
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,919
creating brands is that sometimes people

187
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,840
think it's like logo type color. There

188
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,560
is like that's the trifecta of brand.

189
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,720
But realistically, there's so much more.

190
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,360
There's so much more interesting things

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,160
that you can do with photography, art

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,639
direction. You can make like a cool way

193
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,400
that you know the the type skews to

194
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,000
represent motion or you can even bring

195
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,160
in some sort of like really exciting uh

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,479
movement in terms of like okay we're

197
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,840
going to have this image be blurred or

198
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,680
this image has like a 3D effect or it

199
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,319
has like this uh X-ray MRI scan and

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,520
coloring to for like a uh you know a

201
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
healthcare company or something like

202
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,720
that. people are so so quick to just be

203
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,199
like, "Oh, no. I just need a logo. I

204
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
just want to put a logo on a PowerPoint,

205
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
you know, cover or something like that."

206
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,160
And I think that brand is so much deeper

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
than that. And I feel like if you're

208
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,639
approaching it in this shallow kind of

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
way, people will get to the bottom of it

210
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,880
really quickly. And I think that that is

211
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,960
something that is a very dangerous

212
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,919
territory because like you're relying on

213
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,000
the product to be absolutely impeccable

214
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,080
if the brand is super super shallow. A

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,080
verbal identity is all the words that

216
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
you use to communicate. It kind of comes

217
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,599
out of strategy. It, you know, often a

218
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
strategy is mostly an inter internal

219
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,639
facing document. It's mostly for your

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
team if you're growing. It's things that

221
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
you say to your team like, "Oh, here's

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,280
the things that we value and we're never

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,440
going to change or um here's what we're

224
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
trying to do and and the way that we're

225
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,360
going to position our company in order

226
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
to do that." Verbal identity is once you

227
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,400
cross that line between talking to your

228
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,560
internal audience or maybe your partners

229
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,240
and talking to your your external

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,759
audience, right? So that's how do you

231
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,599
what are your website going to say?

232
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
What's the tone that you use? And then

233
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,800
what are the actual words that you put

234
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,319
on a website that you put on social

235
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
posts that you put on ads that you put

236
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
in a video? What's your tagline? What

237
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
are your headlines? How do you talk

238
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
about yourself? It's interesting because

239
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,599
in some ways it's different than design

240
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
because a lot of elements of design like

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,120
a logo often you'll get a logo and

242
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,639
you'll keep it and you won't touch it

243
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,919
for a long time or you'll get a color

244
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
palette and you'll sort of settle into

245
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
that color palette and it doesn't change

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,199
frequently. Words are different, right?

247
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,479
So words change all the time and lots of

248
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
people you're you know your website

249
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
headline might change every couple of

250
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,599
months who knows like you people are

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,919
writing new elements and products all

252
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,760
the time. So it's really important with

253
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,000
a verbal identity to make sure you

254
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,000
understand the overarching tone and

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
personality of like who we are and how

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
we talk so that then when you are

257
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,320
writing new lines I mean never a verbal

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
identity is never going to deliver all

259
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,519
the words you ever need to use. Instead,

260
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,120
it's just going to set the tone so that

261
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,279
then you can continue to write new words

262
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
that always feel on brand and like

263
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,240
they're written by the same personality.

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,160
Like for Gamma, for example, we worked

265
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
on their verbal identity. The big idea

266
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,519
that we really rooted everything in was

267
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,519
this idea of get get your ideas out

268
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
there. And we loved that as a starting

269
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
point of when you think about who their

270
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,640
audience is, they're not people who are

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
so talented at designing a presentation

272
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
or making their own website. there are

273
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,320
people who are more interested in the

274
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
ideas and just need it to get out there

275
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
more quickly and that's exactly what

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
Gamma does. So, we love this idea. Um,

277
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
but then when you start to think, okay,

278
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
what does that sound like? How do you

279
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,720
express that idea to your audiences? We

280
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,880
had so much fun working on the tone for

281
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,680
this one because one of our tone words

282
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,680
was imaginative and and so few brands

283
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
get to be imaginative, you know, and I

284
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,200
think there's just it's an unlock button

285
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
when you get to say, "Oh, you don't have

286
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
to use, you know, if I was a writer and

287
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,800
somebody handed me a verbal identity

288
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
that had imaginative, that means I get

289
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,760
to use fun words." Like I don't have to

290
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
use the same regular words that

291
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,680
everybody else uses to say, "Start your

292
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,839
presentation now." You can instead say,

293
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,399
"Start a presentation about, I don't

294
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,000
know, exploring the ocean now." And you

295
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,240
can suddenly start to put a lot more

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,839
personality into that brand because you

297
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
have a verbal identity that tells you

298
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,040
right from the beginning, use your

299
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
imagination, do something interesting,

300
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
do something different. We've built

301
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
verbal identities for lots of clients.

302
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,079
We're working right now with a client

303
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
called Contra that helps uh freelancers

304
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
get paid. And so they were a really

305
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
really tricky verbal identity because

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
they have two very distinct audiences,

307
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
right? So that on the one hand they have

308
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,279
the people who are freelancers, people

309
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,200
who get want to get more jobs and get

310
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,720
paid. Maybe they're a designer, maybe

311
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
they're an animator, maybe they're a

312
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
writer, maybe they're a developer, maybe

313
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
they're a videographer, who knows? But

314
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,240
they want sort of more 1099 work. They

315
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,920
want to show their work off um and get

316
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,040
hired. And then on the other side, you

317
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,279
have the people who are going to hire

318
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,800
them. And their reasons for being on

319
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,040
Contra are very different because of

320
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,720
those two audiences. So, it took us a

321
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,399
lot of work to figure out how do we

322
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
connect with both of them at the same

323
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,399
time and make sure that we're

324
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
communicating slightly different

325
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
offerings, slightly different values,

326
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
but in the same tone that feels

327
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,839
consistent across the board and using

328
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,240
the same sort of core messaging across

329
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,320
the board. Our concept for them was get

330
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
more creative because whether you're a

331
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
creative a self-described creative

332
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,519
person who's trying to get more work,

333
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
it's this is a way for you to get more

334
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
creative work, right? And on the other

335
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
hand, if you're somebody who's trying to

336
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,800
hire more creatives, you can get more

337
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
creative team. You can get more creative

338
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
with the way that you're forming your

339
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
business and growing your business. If

340
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
you want to scale more quickly, you

341
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,519
don't necessarily have to hire the

342
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,959
traditional way. So, we love it because

343
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
it allows you to sort of like fill in

344
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,839
the blank after creative of get more

345
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
creative and then you can say whatever

346
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,279
it is that you want in your mind. So,

347
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
being able to hit on something that felt

348
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,240
really powerful for both of those

349
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,279
audiences was really fun. I would say

350
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,920
the most common mistake that I see is

351
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,440
thinking that exactly what you want

352
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,720
people to do is what you should write.

353
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,160
And I think that doesn't happen in

354
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
advertising. You know, in the big

355
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,480
advertising world, people are really

356
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,880
understand that you don't write a

357
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,560
billboard that says buy more chocolate.

358
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
You make people want chocolate, right?

359
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
You make them think, oh, there's nothing

360
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
better than a bar of chocolate right

361
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
now. And I think when you when a lot of

362
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
people go a lot of particularly like in

363
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,680
the tech world people who are building

364
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,240
products or like writing a website they

365
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,320
forget that and they go out and they say

366
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,839
buy now on their website which is not

367
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
actually the best way to get somebody to

368
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,519
buy something. What you have to do is

369
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,399
make them want it. You have to appeal to

370
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
an emotion inside of them and make that

371
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
connection. Right? So, if I were to talk

372
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,959
like broadly in the world right now, I

373
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,279
see a ton of ads, especially in the AI

374
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,440
space that are all about efficiency and

375
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,760
I just think it's ridiculous because I

376
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
look I you could not you could stop a

377
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
thousand people on the street and ask

378
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,320
them what they want in life and no one

379
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,720
is going to say I really wish I was more

380
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
efficient. Like that's not an emotion.

381
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
That's not a thing that people want.

382
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,120
It's a thing that people want for their

383
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,560
teams. It's a thing they want for their

384
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,160
companies. Maybe they want other people

385
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
who are they're paying to be more

386
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,200
efficient, but nobody wants that for

387
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,279
themselves. So, I just think you have to

388
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
connect with something beyond that,

389
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
something that people actually want,

390
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,839
something that feels positive to them

391
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,040
instead of just saying AI, it'll make

392
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
you more efficient. Like, that's not

393
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,079
actually a thing people want to buy. So,

394
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
let's move beyond the efficiency and

395
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,839
figure out what can what can it provide

396
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,480
that's a benefit to my life. Copywriting

397
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,320
is so interesting. In one of my early

398
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,639
jobs, I used to talk with one of my good

399
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,160
copywriting friends about copywriting is

400
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,079
either the easiest job in the world or

401
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
the hardest job in the world. And it

402
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,240
just all depends on how well you do it.

403
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,639
And I think particularly now in the

404
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,560
world of AI, if you're writing something

405
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
that sounds like JT GPT could write it,

406
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,040
then you're it's going to be hard out

407
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,720
there because the the the reality is

408
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
like there's a whole new set of tools

409
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
that are going to be capable of writing

410
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
copy. And the only thing we have the

411
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,720
only leg up we have on chatbt, it's like

412
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,720
it's not speed, it's not efficiency, but

413
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,720
we can be more creative and we can think

414
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,000
from like a more human perspective. So

415
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,880
to me, the main difference between fine

416
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
copy and good copy is what's the

417
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,560
emotion? What's the feeling that's

418
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,639
behind it? How do you make somebody read

419
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,959
something and feel something? So I like

420
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,720
to think of copywriting much more from a

421
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,519
storytelling perspective or a cinematic

422
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,040
perspective of like how do you make

423
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,880
something feel emotional and strike a

424
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
chord with somebody as opposed to simply

425
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
conveying information, right? Of course,

426
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
you want to convey information as well,

427
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,639
especially when you're on a website and

428
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,680
practical executions. A lot of bad

429
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,600
copywriting stops at conveying

430
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,639
information. It conveys information, and

431
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
that's fine, but it doesn't make

432
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
somebody feel something. And when I

433
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,199
often hear people say things like, "Oh,

434
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,680
people don't read anymore." I'm like,

435
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,199
"That is so not true. People read all of

436
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,959
Game of Thrones, and Game of Thrones was

437
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,480
an incredibly long and incredibly dense

438
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,440
book. Why? Because it was filled with

439
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,720
emotion." People read a lot, but they

440
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
only read when it makes them feel

441
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,680
something, and they're not interested in

442
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,240
reading very dense and informative

443
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,000
information. So, I I think that the main

444
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,920
differentiator if you want something to

445
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,760
be good is for it to be emotional. And I

446
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
think that's also happens to be what

447
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,000
gives us a leg up on Chat GPT is because

448
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,000
Chad GPT doesn't have any emotions. So,

449
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
it can try to emulate emotion, but it

450
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,600
can't genuinely understand the

451
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
difference between who headlines. If one

452
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,880
of those headlines makes your heart hurt

453
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
and the other one doesn't, CHBT doesn't

454
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
know the difference. technically they

455
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,000
might be equal. So my advice to any

456
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
copywriter out there would be like write

457
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,680
with your heart. Like put as much

458
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
emotion and heart as you can into

459
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,360
everything and you're more likely to hit

460
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,839
something that that changes the world or

461
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,839
makes a

462
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,120
difference. We've had clients before. So

463
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,519
Perplexity in particular was a really

464
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,680
hard client because their audience is

465
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,279
literally everyone. Like they in the

466
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,600
same way that like Google's audience is

467
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,279
everyone. They want anyone on the planet

468
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,720
to be able to go to Google and find

469
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,320
something and perplexity wanted that

470
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,560
same thing. So there was no like

471
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
defining yeah but who's more likely to

472
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
use this or who like no it's just how do

473
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,399
you appeal to everyone all at the same

474
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,480
time and that's really really hard. What

475
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,320
they wanted to do was so aspirational

476
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,920
and so we were somewhat lucky in that we

477
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
did it a little bit earlier. I feel like

478
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,720
the AI field is messier now and it's

479
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,399
more crowded now than it was. But at the

480
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
time it felt like there were only a few

481
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,560
serious contenders in AI. And so it was

482
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,680
much easier to be like okay as opposed

483
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,040
to chat GBT and you know maybe co-pilot

484
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,199
like what do you do differently than the

485
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,639
the key ones. I think Bard was at the

486
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,160
time we were looking at Bard as one of

487
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,240
their competitors and so um it we really

488
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,920
quickly came to this fact that they had

489
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,240
citations and no one else at the time

490
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,920
was doing it in quite the same way. It

491
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,079
allowed you to turn your AI experience

492
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,680
from, you know, chatbt, you ask

493
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,399
something, it gives you information and

494
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,399
that's sort of like a dead end into a

495
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,839
portal to everything, right? So like

496
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
basically turning it into like what

497
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
Google used to be, which is the front

498
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,560
page of the internet. Like perplexity is

499
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,399
now your your starting point and then

500
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,959
you can click any of those citation

501
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,279
links and go anywhere you want to go. So

502
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,959
we were eventually able to hone in on

503
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,480
like this one differentiator that set

504
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,440
them apart, which is the difference

505
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,560
between perplexity and a chatbt. Chatbt

506
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
is like great, we're going to give you

507
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,199
an answer to your problem. Perplexity is

508
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,440
going to open up doors to knowledge. So

509
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,040
you're going to be able to continue to

510
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,240
discover, right? And there is a very big

511
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680
difference between like, I want to know

512
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
something, great, here's the answer.

513
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,959
It's like the old classic like are you

514
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
going to give somebody a fish? Are you

515
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,519
going to teach them to fish? It's like

516
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
are you going to say great here's the

517
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,240
answer great now I know the answer and

518
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
I'm done with this interaction or are

519
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
you going to say here's the information

520
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,559
and if you would like to learn more

521
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,640
about that here's all the places that

522
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,240
you can go that language of like

523
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,600
circling around the idea of knowledge

524
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,360
and then that's circling around

525
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,120
perplexity as the place where it begins

526
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,559
like everything starts here but then it

527
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,400
can go further and eventually that

528
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
became the headline of like you know

529
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,439
where knowledge begins which is really

530
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,959
beautiful but for the most part

531
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
something like gamma it's actually

532
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
easier than that because you can think

533
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,760
about okay maybe you want everyone to be

534
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
able to use gamma ultimately, but who

535
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,840
are there are certainly people who for

536
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,280
whom it's more it's a better bet that

537
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,960
they're going to be using it. So like I

538
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
think about gamma and sometimes it's

539
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
helpful to think about who it's not for,

540
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,520
right? So gamma is like not for my mom.

541
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
She doesn't like computers. She's scared

542
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,039
of AI. Like this is not her feature.

543
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,039
She's going to be overwhelmed. Cool. We

544
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,200
rule her out. Gamma is also not for

545
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,520
Mike. He's a talented designer. He can

546
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,039
do his own deck presentation and he

547
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,799
doesn't need Gamma to do that magic for

548
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,120
him. He knows how to design a deck. So,

549
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,120
how do you find in the middle something

550
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,080
that feels like it resonates, right? And

551
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,080
I just always find that really being

552
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,919
able to create an accurate picture of

553
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
that person in your head. So, for gamut,

554
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
it might be educators. Here's a teacher.

555
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
I think about the teachers that I know

556
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,760
and I think about what their lives are

557
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
like and I think about who they are and

558
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,720
what their daily routines are and what

559
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
what they do that's different than what

560
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,320
I do and what their needs are and what

561
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,320
kinds of presentations they might make.

562
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
And then the more time you just really

563
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,480
spend treating your audience like almost

564
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,919
like you're in a novel or you're in a

565
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,240
movie and you're putting yourself in the

566
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
shoes of that character, then that

567
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,200
allows you to really think, okay, how do

568
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,039
I talk to them in a way that's going to

569
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,720
matter to them, not necessarily matter

570
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,799
to me. I feel like we've gotten really

571
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,400
lucky with a few logos that like, you

572
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,080
know, the exposure logo is just like a

573
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
globe with a star in it. The perplexity

574
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,480
logo is like a spinning door. And so

575
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,480
like, how do I approach shaping logos

576
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,640
and stuff? A lot of the times I'll try

577
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
to push it into really far extremes

578
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,039
first and then simplify simplify

579
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,640
simplify and like weirdly a lot of the

580
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
times like I'll just post it on Twitter

581
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
and I'll be like has anyone seen this

582
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,080
before? You know what I mean? And so a

583
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,160
lot of the times the collective hive

584
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,080
mind of Twitter or X or whatever you're

585
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,919
calling it now is better than any design

586
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,480
book or any kind of database I could

587
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,919
check or something like that. Um but I

588
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,039
always just try to make sure that our

589
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,200
logos have like like a 10% strange thing

590
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,720
about them. And I think that that is a

591
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
really important part of the studio is

592
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,559
that like I want to make sure that we're

593
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
not creating just a classic geometric

594
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,600
logo that everyone's seen a million

595
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,400
times or something like that. And in

596
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,000
this age or in this time, people are

597
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,400
cranking out logos that look like

598
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,679
flowers and the most like like three

599
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
circles or something like that. And I'm

600
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,559
like, what are we what are we even

601
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
doing? Like that's not that's not

602
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,760
ownable in any way. So I feel like just

603
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,080
trying to get to the foundational parts

604
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,960
of what why this company exists in the

605
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,200
first place. We don't just create logos

606
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,679
just to fill a space. That's never ever

607
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
what we're doing. And so I think that as

608
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,440
long as the logo can kind of tell a

609
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,960
story and like convey an emotion or

610
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,720
convey a strategy or something like

611
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,039
that, that's when we know we're on to

612
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
something. And so we'll create so so

613
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,880
many logos when we're doing identity

614
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,640
process, the going through the identity

615
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,559
process. We'll create dozens of things

616
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,160
that anyone else would be like, "Oh

617
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,080
yeah, that works. That's perfect. Like

618
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,679
that's fine. It fits. It's beautiful.

619
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,360
But we always try to push it a little

620
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
bit further to feel a little bit more

621
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,960
interesting. Same with color. I was in a

622
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,400
I was in a call one time with someone

623
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,760
that was like, "Oh, I just eyropper

624
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,880
things from Pinterest." And I was like,

625
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,200
I like think about color in the deepest

626
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
darkest way possible of like, can it

627
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,799
work in light mode? Can it work in dark

628
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,039
mode? Can we find panones for this

629
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,640
thing? Uh just trying to be responsible

630
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,640
with color is something that is really

631
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,039
exciting to me and it's where it's where

632
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
I find the most joy these days is like

633
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,200
when two colors that maybe don't quite

634
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
go together still create some sort of

635
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
exciting thing or exciting vibration

636
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,559
between them like that's really exciting

637
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
to me. So yeah, I always spend a lot of

638
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,440
time on on color and just making sure

639
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,080
that you leave time to explore is a

640
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
really important

641
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,200
thing. I grew up in New Jersey right

642
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
outside of the city. Uh, but I grew up

643
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
skateboarding, coming to the city to

644
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
skateboard here. I grew up in the

645
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
heydays of Love Park. So, a lot of

646
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
really awesome skateboarders were

647
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,880
hanging out there at that time. And so,

648
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
I was just kind of obsessed with Philly

649
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,120
from such a young age. I would draw the

650
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,200
love sign over and over and over again

651
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,760
on all of my notebooks and things in in

652
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
school. And then in high school, I I had

653
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
a really great art teacher. I had two

654
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,440
really great art teachers that were

655
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,039
like, "You really need to be focused on

656
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
doing something with art." and that is

657
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,159
something that I think that that you

658
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,600
should be you really kind of

659
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,799
hyperfocused on for college. And I was

660
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,159
like, I think I'm going to go be a

661
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,480
history teacher. And they were like,

662
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,280
what if you just applied to one one art

663
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,280
school just for us just to see how uh

664
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,880
see how you like it. And then I did. I

665
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,559
ended up going to an art school in

666
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
Delaware. Quickly transferred out of

667
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,159
that cuz I hated art school. I didn't

668
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,559
really enjoy art school that much

669
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,320
because I was commuting to this college.

670
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,600
So I was driving an hour there, driving

671
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,760
an hour back. And I got there and just

672
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,840
like nobody took it seriously. So like

673
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,520
everyone was like questioning the

674
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,880
homework assignments or being like, "Oh,

675
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,880
I didn't quite understand the homework,

676
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,080
so I just didn't do it." And so I was

677
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,240
like, "I'm working two jobs. I'm driving

678
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,159
here. I'm commuting here." And I'm still

679
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,080
getting the homework done. But you guys,

680
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
for some reason, don't believe in this

681
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
part of your career. And I think that

682
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
car and I talk about this all the time

683
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,360
of just like ever since I saw Photoshop

684
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,880
for the first time and realized what you

685
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,960
could make with it. I was like this is

686
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,280
going to be the rest of my life and I

687
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,280
have no backup plan. I have no other

688
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
thing I want to do. This is exactly what

689
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,080
I want to do. So when I was in art

690
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,360
school I like a lot of people were still

691
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,559
figuring out what they wanted to do. I

692
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,760
would say most of them were still

693
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,120
figuring out what they wanted to do and

694
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,400
I just was like I don't want to be

695
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,720
around this. and um went to a local

696
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
university in South Jersey where I fell

697
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,919
in love with print making. That's where

698
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,600
I did a lot of like posters. I made a

699
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,840
ton of posters, learned about setting

700
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,000
type. I learned about etching prints and

701
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,679
plates and things like that. So print is

702
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,919
like deep deep inside of my DNA. And so

703
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,039
I love to bring that print ethos into a

704
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,120
lot of the things that I'm working on

705
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,120
today. And I'm not so like focused on

706
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,640
making the next best digital product.

707
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm focused on making something that

708
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,799
someone want to hang on their walls. I

709
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,280
was so obsessed with things like element

710
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,840
skateboards and girl and chocolate and

711
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,120
all that stuff. So, I was just like, how

712
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,280
can I make a career doing that stuff?

713
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,799
And that was what really excited me. And

714
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,600
I also realized through skateboarding

715
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,480
that like brand is so much more of an

716
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,480
identity for people than a lot of people

717
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,480
might think. Like, you know, if you're

718
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,840
not skateboarding, you might be like,

719
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,280
"Sure, I buy a special kind of soap, but

720
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,440
that's not your identity." You know what

721
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,760
I mean? But when you skateboard, you

722
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,400
ride that deck and you can get sponsored

723
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,080
by that company. So that company can pay

724
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,120
you to have their board under your feet

725
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,240
or their shoes on your feet. And it just

726
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,720
became so much deeper of a obsession

727
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,080
when you think about like design can

728
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,559
actually be used as like a a proxy for

729
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,200
your identity. Yeah. After college, I

730
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,960
worked at an advertising agency in South

731
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,279
Jersey. There I kind of just learned a

732
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
lot of the basics of the programs. After

733
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,360
that, I went to work at a place called

734
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,600
160 over 90, which is where I met Cara

735
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
and she was my copywriting partner and I

736
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,799
was the design side of it. So, we grew

737
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,720
up in the brand design space completely

738
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
united. We were together on every single

739
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,279
thing that we worked on. So, we

740
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,919
basically have one brain now of how we

741
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,960
think about design and uh the approach

742
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,640
to branding. After that, we both went to

743
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,720
a place called Charity Water in New York

744
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,520
City. And that's where we really focused

745
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,279
on the idea of design can do really good

746
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,120
things for the world. While working at

747
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,400
Charity Water, you learned that design

748
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,880
can change the world through its pure

749
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,480
power to make people believe in a cause.

750
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
When I went to work at Charity Water,

751
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,200
the mission there is to kind of solves

752
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
the world's water crisis. But their

753
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,039
vision, the thing that's above that is

754
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,120
to reinvent the idea of charity. You

755
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,720
know, growing up, you always see like,

756
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,720
oh, Charity doesn't have any money for

757
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,120
design or it always kind of feels like

758
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,880
it doesn't quite fit inside of this. It

759
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,880
shouldn't look fancy. But working at

760
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,840
Charity Water, we really focused on

761
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,440
things feeling nice and feeling like,

762
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,919
you know, uh, something that you should

763
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,520
pay attention to. Utilizing design to

764
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,279
draw attention to these really important

765
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,440
things in the world was something that I

766
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
was just so excited to be a part of. and

767
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,799
we helped raise a few million dollars

768
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,559
when we were there for clean water

769
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,279
projects in Africa and all over the

770
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,360
world. It was really awesome just to be

771
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,279
around people who were excited about

772
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,880
helping people cuz when I went there I

773
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,960
was at a pretty low point in my design

774
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,159
career where I was like is design just

775
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
making millionaires more money and I if

776
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,640
so I don't really want to be part of

777
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,480
that. I left the agency world uh to

778
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,880
focus on just can design be used for

779
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,159
good and I believe it can and had a

780
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
great time while I was there and and

781
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,240
learned so so much. Scott Harrison is

782
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
when you're around him, you just want to

783
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,559
do well and you just want to um you know

784
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,400
help solve the world's biggest problems

785
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,679
and he makes you believe it's possible.

786
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,679
And so I feel like I try to bring a

787
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,200
little bit of that energy to our studio

788
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,640
and to the work that we create where

789
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,919
we're just like, "Yeah, sure. It's no

790
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
problem. If you want to change the world

791
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,880
a little bit, like we we'll help you try

792
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,159
to do that as best we can." And we

793
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
learned about writing a really good

794
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,919
mission statement, having really good

795
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,000
strategy, and also just like the impact

796
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,520
that social media can have on people. We

797
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
learned a lot of that stuff at Charity

798
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,720
Water. And then after Charity Water, we

799
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,480
looked around New York for a little bit.

800
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,880
And we were like, "Okay, like what's our

801
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,080
next step? What's our next move?" And I

802
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,200
really just didn't want to work for

803
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,240
anybody else ever again. And so we moved

804
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,760
home and we're like, "All right, let's

805
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,279
give this studio a shot. We'll see what

806
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,640
happens. As long as I can pay my rent

807
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,960
every month, well, this will be a great

808
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,760
success." And 10 years later, here we

809
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,760
are. So, uh, still paying rent, you

810
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,080
know, still really excited about making

811
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,039
stuff and, um, but yeah, so that's

812
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,559
that's my whole life story.

813
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,600
Mike is, um, honestly, it's wild. He's

814
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,600
unlike most people. He's not he's not a

815
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,039
regular person, you know, regular people

816
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,320
like I wouldn't have started this

817
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:11,440
company by myself. I think um, I'm lucky

818
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,279
because I learned early on uh, the value

819
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
of design, right? Like you can say a

820
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,159
great headline, but if your great

821
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,600
headline is just scribbled on a

822
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
cardboard box, it doesn't have the same

823
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,039
power as when it's when that design and

824
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,440
the copyrightiting are really working

825
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,799
together. And so it was never my idea to

826
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,080
start the company. He like told me he

827
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,080
wanted to start his own company on our

828
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,679
first date. And I think I probably knew

829
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,279
that even beforehand cuz we'd been

830
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,960
working together for months already and

831
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,880
we'd been working all day every day

832
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,120
together. So I knew a lot about him even

833
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,919
before we started dating. And it was

834
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,720
100% his vision. I was just like, "Cool.

835
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,080
I love writing and I love um the

836
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
creativity of it. So if that's your

837
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,039
vision, I will be behind your vision

838
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,360
100%. He's just refuses to let anything

839
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,440
be mediocre and if it's not good enough,

840
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,960
we won't present it. But I do also think

841
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,960
that we are a little bit different than

842
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,520
a lot of studios in you know the

843
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,200
practical side. Like our team, we don't

844
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,640
have a lot of meetings. We don't spend a

845
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
lot of time on sil we don't have a lot

846
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,760
of team building events. Like summer on

847
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,520
our team, she lives in a different

848
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,640
state. We see her maybe once or twice a

849
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,919
year. We the our team our designers they

850
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,720
come into work and they spend eight

851
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,279
hours designing and then they go home.

852
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,720
So because we get them to mostly focus

853
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,960
on their craft and getting better at

854
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,039
their craft instead of being in required

855
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,600
team building events or doing time

856
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,600
sheets or having HR conversation like

857
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,600
none of that is a part of their days. We

858
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,080
just really avoid all of the things that

859
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,919
aren't mostly just design. We have one

860
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,120
team meeting a day where everybody syncs

861
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,720
up to make sure we're all on the same

862
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,720
page. And then other than that, we

863
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,760
mostly just let people do what they do.

864
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,440
And I think that helps us make better

865
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,960
work because the main thing that you do

866
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,399
is actually work on the work instead of

867
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
spending your day in meetings. Do you

868
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,799
have a plan to scale your business? I

869
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,559
mean, Mike is not scalable. No. In

870
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,720
America, there is like a desperate

871
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,840
culture of growth and you must make more

872
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,440
money every year and you have to grow

873
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,880
and you have to succeed and grow and

874
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,480
grow and grow and like everything you

875
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,960
make has to be bigger and better than it

876
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,360
last. And we have to fight against that

877
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
so hard, but really and truly our goal

878
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,919
is never to be a big company. Like we

879
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,679
want to be a small company where we are

880
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,520
still doing the work every single day

881
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
for as long as we have this company.

882
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,080
We've always wanted to grow like a

883
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,919
little bit because if we were a little

884
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,480
maybe 10 people, we could have a little

885
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,080
bit more capacity to do more projects at

886
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,000
once and you know have a bigger team.

887
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,000
But like you said, Mike isn't scalable.

888
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,840
So we've we've already just with our

889
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,440
team of five reached the point where if

890
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,360
we grow much more then he will less and

891
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,120
less be able to actually do the design.

892
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,039
And so we're very very conscious of

893
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,240
that. And we do not want to I mean part

894
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,320
of the reason we started this company

895
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,399
was so that he could be a designer. When

896
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,880
you look at a traditional agency and

897
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,640
your like career path, you go from being

898
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,240
a designer to a senior designer to like

899
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,159
an art director to like a creative

900
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,600
director and very soon all you are is in

901
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,279
meetings. All you are doing is giving

902
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,279
creative direction and you never design

903
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,720
anything. And Mike, that's part of why

904
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,880
we started this company is cuz he just

905
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,120
wants his title to be designer forever.

906
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,520
He just wants to be making the designs.

907
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,919
And so, so far we've been able to keep

908
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,440
doing that where he is a lead designer

909
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,520
on every single project. And that's

910
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,640
really really how we want to keep it.

911
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,080
We'll see if we're able to do that

912
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,399
forever or not, but um that's the goal.

913
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,600
How did I get to this point in my career

914
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,919
is a really good example of just like

915
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,919
not having a backup plan and just trying

916
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,520
really really hard and failing like a

917
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,240
lot. You know, that's something that I

918
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,080
think is super super important for for

919
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,480
people. It's like especially in this new

920
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,559
age of AI, like you can have things spit

921
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,320
out answers and things without even

922
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,760
thinking about it. And to me, I'm just

923
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,000
like, there's so much beauty in messing

924
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,559
up and not being afraid to mess up. And

925
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,760
I think that like skateboarding is the

926
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,720
the ethos of that. Like you only land a

927
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,640
trick once, but you try it 60 times. You

928
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,760
fall in your face, you break your board,

929
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,120
you you you have thrown your body down

930
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,720
this set of stairs or off this ledge 20

931
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,720
times, and at the point you're like your

932
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,480
your body's like, I can't take anymore.

933
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,919
But then like you come really close to

934
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,760
landing one and you're like all of a

935
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
sudden that energy just comes right back

936
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
up and you're like I'm going to try it

937
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,000
one more time and then you land it and

938
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
that's just it was all worth it. And so

939
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,320
for design I'm just like not afraid to

940
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,480
mess up and I'm not afraid to put out

941
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,880
some stuff that maybe people don't like

942
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,799
as long as I learned something about

943
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,240
myself in the process. Like I said

944
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,320
there's no backup plan. I'm doing this

945
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
until I die. So, it's like why would I

946
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,120
ever be scared of learning or be scared

947
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,320
of failing when like this is it? I'm

948
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,159
there's going of course there's going to

949
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,919
be highs and there's going to be lows.

950
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,120
So, why not just try it every single

951
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,200
day? And I think that's the most

952
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,159
important thing when people get scared

953
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,919
of trying. That's when you fall into

954
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,840
safety. That's when you fall into being

955
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,000
like, "Oh, I just wish I could grab like

956
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,240
these pieces and like collage them in a

957
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,679
way, like do some scrapbooking." And I'm

958
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,519
just like, "No, I want to reinvent the

959
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,440
book." like almost every single time.

960
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,039
Just that's that's the point. It's why

961
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,080
we're doing this. It's like I don't I

962
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,919
don't understand people that are just

963
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,240
like I wish it was easier and I'm like

964
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,159
why? Like I'm having so much more fun

965
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,760
making the stuff. That's where I have

966
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,880
that's where my heart feels the feelings

967
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,240
of you know um you're inventing

968
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
something. I guess you're creating

969
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,320
something from scratch and there's

970
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,320
nothing more beautiful than that.
