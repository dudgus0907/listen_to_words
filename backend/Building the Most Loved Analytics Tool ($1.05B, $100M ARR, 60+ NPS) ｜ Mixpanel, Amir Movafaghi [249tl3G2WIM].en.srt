1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
at one point mixpanel we were turning

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,120
almost half of our customers every year

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,240
and it was this place where as a company

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,799
that's growing fast you know in some

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,920
ways that can that metric can be

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,680
overlooked but in many ways it was a

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,279
time where we really came together and

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,960
said look turning half the customers is

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,320
a major major problem in that we are

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
clearly not driving and delivering the

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,039
value as a company that we need to and

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,920
even though you know we we're still

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,280
growing we have to go back and address

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,840
churn but the reality was much more

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,160
complicated and nuanced it so happened

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,800
that there wasn't one answer you it

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,600
wasn't one thing it was a set of a bunch

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,120
of different things that we needed to do

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,320
and so that's where our journey began

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,120
and we literally made a you know a

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
series of categories of different

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,520
priorities we had a series of things

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,559
that we were going to go out and and

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,480
Tackle uh and everyone the company from

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,800
go to market to epd sort of had this

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,159
core mission to go out and get this done

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,960
and the result was really incredible and

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,200
by the time we did our series C we were

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,000
at 50 and this past spring we almost

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,280
touched 60 which is really like now kind

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,520
of consumer grade category and then

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,840
retention went from you know 50 to close

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,200
to

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,920

million in Revenue a little less than a

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,200
couple of years ago we're super proud to

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,759
have our uh one other metric that we

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,439
disclos in our customer MPS being almost

43

a consumer grade approaching

44
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,670
[Music]

45
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:54,000
60 I was born in uh in tan in Iran I

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,479
spent 7even years in Istanbul Turkey so

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
I spent a good number of years there we

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,600
moved there when I was about eight and

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,000
then I came to United States when I was

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,560
15 when I was uh going through graduate

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
school it was a time when financial

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
crisis had hit in New York it was right

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,040
at the the beginning of where social

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,680
platforms were coming online and

55
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,280
Uprising uh in Iran I couldn't get a

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,280
hold of my parents because all the phone

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,519
lines were were shut down and you know

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,959
email was not working and at the time

59
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,720
Twitter was the only uh uh platform that

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
was uh really reporting what was

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
happening on the ground in ton and it

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,239
was this sort of like incredible moment

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,400
of realizing just how powerful the

64
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,360
social platforms were becoming at that

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,720
point it was such a personal attachment

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,959
to the product that was my lead in to

67
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,519
Tech so I joined Twitter in 2010 when I

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,239
joined a company we were about a little

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,200
over 100 employees we were pre-ad

70
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,720
Revenue it was a extraordinarily

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,920
exciting time even Twitter at its height

72
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,480
of success every 6 months was like a

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
completely different company you had

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,040
this company that you would wake up you

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,000
all of a sudden had an ad product that

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,440
failed you kind of had a moment of

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,720
having to really kind of have these

78
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,200
moments of existential crisis right hey

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
are we going to have you are we going to

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,920
have a company you know in 6 months is

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,760
there going to be are we going to be

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,560
able to make it to the other side in a

83
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,799
lot of ways the way that we go through

84
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,400
and fix things together as a team is

85
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,120
this ability to really come together on

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,000
a core problem and we understand why we

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,080
are focusing on what we're focusing we

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,840
have Clarity around what objective and

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,239
what outcome we're trying to get to and

90
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,959
then we're flexible about the how right

91
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,959
and we're able to take feedback along

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,840
the way from our customers from our

93
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,040
peers from our board you know from

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,400
everybody investors like we are able to

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,480
learn and understand and then iterate

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,360
and then hold ourselves accountable to

97
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,239
these outcomes so I think fixing

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,319
problems at its core comes down to First

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,760
really centering oursel on why this

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,360
matters why it takes precedent priority

101
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,760
over the 99 other problems you have and

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,599
then rallying and inspiring people to

103
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,319
really get in have Clarity on how they

104
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,760
can make an impact and difference on

105
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:08,959
that Journey when I left Twitter we had

106
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,319
grown from nearly 100 employees to 4,500

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,959
employees it was from close to zero to

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,239
you 2 billion in Revenue it was um

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,880
phenomenal incredible growth that

110
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,000
happened during that time biggest lesson

111
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,160
was the impact that user experience had

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,960
on the success of the company and this

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,400
Obsession around delivering a better

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,639
product a better user experience and

115
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,360
sort of like a in a way having that as a

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
leading path into better monetization

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,000
and better growth companies in

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,400
Enterprise software have invested quite

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,280
a bit on technology you know better

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,199
utility building a better technology as

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,400
like a first order of business being

122
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,919
part of Twitter it was getting a lot

123
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,440
more closer to just how much the

124
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,960
significance of making sure that you're

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,039
always thinking of the user the customer

126
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,960
first before you go figure out

127
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,560
everything else because without the

128
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,880
value without that Ultimate Experience

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,039
that you're delivering that's creating

130
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,960
value everything else can feel much more

131
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,840
femoral and much weaker

132
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,120
Foundation I think you know in many ways

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,680
when you're part of a in in a great

134
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,639
company that's has a number of different

135
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,319
opportunities to make an impact and

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,600
connect and grow with in many ways you

137
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,639
want to make sure that your skill set is

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,400
You Know Rich enough and mature enough

139
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,720
to be able to deliver a bunch of impact

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,560
but hopefully if you're in the right

141
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,400
position you're also gaining a bunch of

142
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,199
new knowledge and new tools I think in

143
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,240
many ways the the growth comes from just

144
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,560
having that sheer intellectual curiosity

145
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
and a desire to make sure that you're

146
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,000
influencing and impacting things that

147
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,479
matter and so biggest one is this

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,520
constant ability to ask am I doing the

149
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,639
thing that is the highest impact uh work

150
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,319
that I could be doing am I focusing on

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,240
things that actually will drive and make

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,400
a difference and then usually if you're

153
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,680
in the right role and you have the right

154
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,919
foundational skill set then the rest of

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
it will take care of itself you'll

156
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,000
figure out resources and who to tap into

157
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
it's one of the best parts of being in

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,759
Silicon Valley is you pick up the phone

159
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,000
and you can call so many people around

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,240
us that have either experienced that

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,280
exact same situation that you're in one

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,160
of the things that I always mention

163
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,520
people talk about like hey what's so

164
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
special about Silicon Valley why you

165
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,080
know would I move my company there why

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,479
would we you know start a company you

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
know in Silicon Valley instead of

168
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,440
somewhere else the and the answer I give

169
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,280
is when I started at Twitter we were

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,280
going through a bunch of newish problems

171
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,639
that we were experiencing and at that

172
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,199
time I remember just through networking

173
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,560
finding out experts that were you know

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
at Facebook or at LinkedIn or at Google

175
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,560
and you would reach out in every single

176
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,039
time almost 100% of the time there were

177
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,479
willing to jump on a call and they were

178
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,199
willing to collaborate and they were

179
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,280
willing to give advice and I think that

180
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,000
was such a a phenomenal sort of

181
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,199
validation of just how important it is

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,440
to be in an environment where people are

183
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,080
experiencing that same set of growth

184
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,319
ambition and experiences that they can

185
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,240
impart and and give to you as you're

186
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,240
solving your your problems in your

187
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,280
company do you use Ken Lee to book calls

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,199
Tod do is to manage tasks trell to keep

189
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,919
track of projects what if I told you

190
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,319
that you could do all these with one

191
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,199
tool but then it also integrates with

192
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,440
all of the tools that I just mentioned

193
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,800
hi everyone I'm Hannah from the EO team

194
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,520
and I'm here to introduce the

195
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,639
gamechanging productivity tool akif flow

196
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,560
it's basically a smart combination of

197
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,680
all the essential productivity features

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,080
I need on the daily first is the

199
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,680
beautiful marriage of task management

200
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,560
and time blocking akif flow has this

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,560
interface where you can create a to-do

202
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,120
list just as you would in any task

203
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,000
management tools but you can also drag

204
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,599
these certain tasks right into your

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,240
calendar to the exact time of day I find

206
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,639
this particular visualization of two dos

207
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,919
and schedules side by side very helpful

208
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,000
in prioritizing my work carving out

209
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,479
chunks of focus time needed for video

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,360
editing blocking time here syncs with

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,720
all of my other connected apps such as

212
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,400
slack Ken Le and more secondly it's the

213
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,639
magical command bar the go-to shortcut

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,800
for all features within aif flow instead

215
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,879
of navigating the app manually I simply

216
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,159
click on the command bar to command what

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,199
I wish to perform for example let's just

218
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,640
say that we confirmed an interview

219
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
filming and I want to put that in my

220
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,519
calendar I could just set that up

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,760
manually on the Google Calendar or I

222
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,680
could simply go ahead and type akif flow

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,720
founder interview filming on October

224
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,640
28th from 12:00 p.m. to 3: p.m. and

225
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,480
there's my schedule we've been using it

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,600
to keep track of our hectic filming and

227
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
traveling schedules every

228
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,040
day okay at one point mpanel we were

229
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,720
turning almost half of our customers

230
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,279
every year and it was this place where

231
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,160
as a company that's growing fast you

232
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,800
know in some ways that can that metric

233
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
can be overlooked you're like Hey we're

234
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,120
still we're still growing things are

235
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
still great and you know you would show

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,160
up and and look at these numbers and you

237
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,959
wouldn't even blink you're like yeah we

238
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,600
just had like half of our customers like

239
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,079
walk out the door but it's not a big

240
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,519
deal cuz we're getting so much more and

241
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:26,120
we're still growing but in many ways it

242
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,720
was a time where we really came together

243
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,200
and said look turning half the customers

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,680
is a major your major problem in that we

245
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,839
are clearly not driving and delivering

246
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,600
the value as a company that we need to

247
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,480
and even though you know we we're still

248
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
growing we have to go back and address

249
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,560
churn as a way of making sure we have

250
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,920
sustainable growth over time and that

251
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,120
product needs to kind of get to this

252
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,959
level of maturity over time and you know

253
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,079
the problem is actually this one was

254
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,040
quite difficult cuz we were initially

255
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,800
just trying to find like easy answers

256
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
you know maybe this is a segment problem

257
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,680
like SMB has higher turn maybe we just

258
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,680
need to go to Enterprise and that'll be

259
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,040
the fix all of our problems but the

260
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,079
reality was much more complicated and

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,000
nuanced and what it required was a very

262
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,839
very diligent way of again segmenting

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,040
and understanding the behavior from a

264
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,760
different customers in different

265
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
segments and then being able to really

266
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,120
narrow in on the reasons it it so

267
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,920
happened that there wasn't one answer

268
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,959
you know it wasn't one thing it was a

269
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,839
set of a bunch of different things that

270
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,040
we needed to do and the list was quite

271
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
overwhelming the way that we came at it

272
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,720
was instead of putting some crazy insane

273
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,040
kind of goal for where we wanted to be

274
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,560
in a in in a year time we acknowledge

275
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,040
that retention was a lagging indicator

276
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,279
that it would take time for us to really

277
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,959
move it and so instead we said what is

278
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,839
the single kind of proxy leading

279
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,079
indicator we can grab that would Inspire

280
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,200
the team get them excited about making

281
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,440
the right set of improvements um in

282
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,920
moving retention in the right direction

283
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,920
and then we shifted our Focus to NPS

284
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,320
user NPS we said look if we are able to

285
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,440
improve Pro user sentiment that's a much

286
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,040
faster in product signal we're going to

287
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,480
get from our users that starts going up

288
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,720
then we know we can kind of move the

289
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,279
dial on on retention over time and so

290
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,920
that's where our journey began and we

291
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,720
literally made a you know a series of

292
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,320
categories of different priorities we

293
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,720
had a series of things that we were

294
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,200
going to go out and and Tackle uh and

295
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,680
everyone the company from go to market

296
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,399
to epd sort of had this core mission to

297
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,399
go out and get this done and the result

298
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,839
was really incredible we were in single

299
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:38,200
digits uh MPS at the time and we were

300
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,839
able to move that 10 points every single

301
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,040
year and by the time we did our series C

302
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,680
we were at 50 and this past spring we

303
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,279
almost touched 60 which is really like

304
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,440
now kind of consumer grade category and

305
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,639
then retention went from you know 50 to

306
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,680
close to 90% as a result which I think

307
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,880
again speaks to this ability to

308
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,160
establish real feedback loops that allow

309
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,440
you to understand whether you're the

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
things you're doing are moving the

311
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
needle and then having this kind of

312
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,160
combination of leading lagging

313
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,480
indicators so that you have things to

314
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,959
inspire get inspired along the way in

315
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,480
your journey of execution rather than

316
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,639
having to wait you know a year to find

317
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,120
out if something was

318
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,680
working companies go through very very

319
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,079
different stages and challenges as

320
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,800
they're going from no Revenue to the

321
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,519
initial uh signals that there's demand

322
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,880
and there's a need for their product to

323
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,000
get 10 million Milestone they get the 50

324
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,240
million Milestone and there's huge drop

325
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
offs from each of these stages learning

326
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,079
an experience that at least we've taken

327
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,320
here at mix spanel is the ability to

328
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,160
really have a very rich signal coming in

329
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,519
from the pool of customers that you

330
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,720
don't have right because so much of your

331
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,600
signal and constant uh feedback loop is

332
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,279
around the core Market that you're

333
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,560
addressing and your core set of

334
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,519
customers that are paying you today a

335
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,320
lot of your signals are coming from

336
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,240
existing customers and so along the way

337
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,639
as company's maturing you want to make

338
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,880
sure you always have in the initial

339
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,279
phase you you you just you want to get

340
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,160
as small as possible solve the problem

341
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:21,480
for the smallest audience that is uh

342
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,360
able to get value and pay you for for

343
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,959
your product um but as you're scaling

344
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,800
and getting to 50 100 million plus then

345
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,639
you're really trying to also make sure

346
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,360
you have a lens toward

347
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,279
the set of the part of the market that

348
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
you don't own that you don't have and

349
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
make sure that you understand what

350
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,040
opportunities you have to grow and

351
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,760
continue to expand your offering and and

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,360
creating more value for a bigger part of

353
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,360
the market I think Beyond product and

354
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,399
and signal from customers the other

355
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,639
dimension that's really critical as

356
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,680
you're scaling is way that teams operate

357
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,560
internally how and the the way that your

358
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,920
executive team and you as a CEO need to

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,480
operate is going to change completely

360
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,240
right as a 10 person startup you're in a

361
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,360
very different capacity everybody's

362
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,800
everybody's doing everything and then

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,959
you're you're need to then go create

364
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,600
leverage really create autonomy and

365
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,759
ownership modularity within the

366
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,720
organization is going to be key uh in

367
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,720
driving kind of growth and success you

368
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,720
need past a certain

369
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,360
scale I think product L growth is is

370
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,600
really important and I think sometimes

371
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,279
we oversimplify what it means even expel

372
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,000
we've we've had quite a bit of a journey

373
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,839
in terms of understanding the nuances of

374
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
you know what it entails what works

375
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,639
within product L growth and what you

376
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,399
need to augment and layer on the the

377
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,079
fact of the matter is what's really

378
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,720
awesome about product L growth and

379
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,560
what's so good about so many of the

380
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,160
startups and different you know growth

381
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,279
companies really leaning into to this at

382
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,360
its heart the principle is we have we

383
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,480
need to have a really amazing product

384
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,839
that's self- servable that can people

385
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,800
can get value out of right away that

386
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,759
sort of speaks for itself

387
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,959
uh you barely need to sell you know

388
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,279
that's kind of like the the the end all

389
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,279
sort of uh goal of product lead and

390
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,440
that's awesome but there is so much more

391
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,880
to being able to leveraging product L

392
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,360
growth and actually creating sustainable

393
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,279
growth over time and a big part of that

394
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,680
is this element of you know Market

395
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,120
education everyone is going to come in

396
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,320
to your product with a very different

397
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,800
set of maturity right they may be at a

398
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,240
different part of the company

399
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,680
understanding of the problem that you're

400
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,000
trying to solve as a company being very

401
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,680
intellectually honest about truly

402
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,920
segmenting and understanding where you

403
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,279
have an opportunity to actually go drive

404
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,800
product Le growth where you can deliver

405
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,720
a self- serve for the most part a self-

406
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,920
serve experience that's really key

407
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,399
acknowledging that there's this space

408
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,360
and there's absolutely an opportunity to

409
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,399
be very sales l and a way that you drive

410
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,120
augmenting that product Le growth

411
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,680
knowing that you can always rely and

412
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,560
fall back on the fact that you have an

413
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,120
incredible product that once you get to

414
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,440
a right level of Market education when

415
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,680
you get to the right level of getting a

416
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,519
customer to the same spot then your

417
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,720
product will take care of the rest it's

418
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,000
just this kind of core appreciation that

419
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,839
initially product L growth is really

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,199
awesome because of its unit economics

421
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,079
it's like the fastest the most

422
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,920
affordable the best way you can possibly

423
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,440
grow but it's kind of core at its core

424
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,040
uh it requires a really deep

425
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
segmentation Focus for it to to

426
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,560
work first one is about being open and

427
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,440
being open to feedback you know we as

428
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,240
people get attached emotionally to our

429
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,560
decisions about how to go from point A

430
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,560
to point B and just knowing that uh

431
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,079
having qualitative quantitative feedback

432
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,360
will let your course correct and make

433
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,240
sure you get to the destination on time

434
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,639
um and then the second one is about

435
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,519
being able to lead change and Lead

436
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,759
change has the element that Nick spanel

437
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,880
every months is going to be a

438
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,959
fundamentally different company and we

439
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,880
want not only individuals to you know be

440
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,199
okay with change or support it but we

441
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,039
want them to lead it we want them to

442
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,480
know that we're going to need to explore

443
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,959
and find ways to go out and create ways

444
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
that we can create more value in the

445
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,679
marketplace third is uh a customer focus

446
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,559
which at the end of the day we're only

447
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,799
successful if our customers are getting

448
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,600
value and so any decision we make around

449
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,559
what product we prioritize How We Do

450
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,319
pricing and packaging right how we

451
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,200
evolve our support organization is

452
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,880
around this kind of long-term value that

453
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,120
we're creating for our customers the

454
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,000
fourth one is results oriented which

455
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,440
acknowledges that you know the single

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,480
best way for us to keep ourselves

457
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,080
accountable on whether we're moving

458
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,840
toward fulfilling our mission as a

459
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,120
company to help the world learn from its

460
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,919
data is uh people's willingness to pay

461
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,960
us money to to solve that problem and so

462
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,480
Topline a growth are we uh driving that

463
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
in a sustainable fashion through the

464
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,480
right margin profile and then finally is

465
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,000
the one team which really emphasizes the

466
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,120
import importance of establishing

467
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
meaningful connections among employees

468
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,960
to move beyond the transactional zoom

469
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,600
interactions into a place where they

470
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,280
know each other they can trust one

471
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,679
another so when they do get into a

472
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,679
position of conflict there's a

473
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,240
foundational trust and safety that

474
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,780
allows them to work through those things

475
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:27,069
productively

476
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:27,069
