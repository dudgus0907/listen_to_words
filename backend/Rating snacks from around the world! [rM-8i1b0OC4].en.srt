363
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,759
that's a little weird what kind of like

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
Oreo style this like give it a little

365
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,199
swirl around like a dip and then just

366
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,040
yeah yeah let me do that o dippy di it's

367
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,560
just a waste of milk it's worse than

368
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,759
grabbing a handful of

369
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Cher I'd rather hit the cabin and just

370
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,480
go give me some fruit loops and then go

371
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,279
on my Merry way I age I don't think this

372
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,240
is an experience I ever need yeah I'm

373
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:33,519
putting it here though oops it is good

374
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,519
it is good I'm put it write right here

375
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,399
it's just too overwhelming like I feel

376
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,279
like okay listen you're right wait no no

377
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,560
no listen listen listen I'm going to

378
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,360
break it down for you I think they try

379
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,680
to overdo that Froot Loop flavor so that

380
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,399
when you suck it up with the milk it

381
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,120
adds the flavor to the milk but it

382
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,440
doesn't do it right so when you just eat

383
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,880
the straw it's so much Froot Loop flavor

384
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,800
because it's trying to compensate for

385
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,199
the milk getting to your mouth yeah I

386
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,720
think 10th place on those okay ninth

387
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,279
place is fine hand of agreement yeah

388
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,000
Peach Diet Coke oh this looks good I

389
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,639
don't like Coke but I like or Peach Coke

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,040
no diet wait I don't like the smell kind

391
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:13,920
of it's giving baby throw up a

392
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:17,360
little I love it no you don't yeah hold

393
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,759

394
