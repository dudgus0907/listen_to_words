it was a drug because I was really young

271
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,519
so I went up to Mom and I was like I

272
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,320
think we should name him Crystal

273
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,060
that's what I said to Mom that's good I

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,620

276
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,120

278
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,440
biggest pet peeve when people request an

279
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,560

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,240

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,920
will I ever apologize to someone if they

284
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,480
blatantly ask for it that's crazy you

285
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,220

personal apology then you need to well

291
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,180
the whole point of an apology is to like

292
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,399
this is to solve is to solve a solution

293
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,660

294
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,040
to being wrong but if somebody has to

295
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,180
tell you that you have to apologize for

296
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,120

exist because I've ordered one I

380
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,740
literally ordered a guzz bucket and they

381
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,579
didn't bring it to the house thousands

382
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,579
that they brought foreign

383
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:51,180

385
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,899

392
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,680
my mom went to KFC today and I thought

393
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,839
the bucket of Pepsi was a typo well they

394
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,060

off the plastic pouch adding this is the

396
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,800
most American [ __ ] I've ever seen

397
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,120
the rest in peace of God's bucket I

398
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,720
don't think there's a fly on the window

399
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,720

yeah I ordered one once door Dash and

402
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,060
wanted it really bad and they didn't

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,860
bring it they just brought like four

404
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,540
sodas like cups like the hardest Pokemon

405
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,279
in that correct the whole point was I

406
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,620
wanted to guzz bucket like I wanted to

407
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,639
guzzle down the guzz bucket

408
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,639
I don't like that word because

409
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:55,519

410
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,839
never want to hear it again

411
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,959
very comfortable with the lack of the

412
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,260
word guzz in my vocabulary to this day

413
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,760

like

457
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,640
the only thing preventing her from going

458
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,799
