138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,919
she's like oh I know this like

139
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,680
embarrassing I just put lotion on my

140
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
hands are like slippery can you open she

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,400
held up her hands like this like showed

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,080
him his lotion she was like yeah I just

143
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,520
like put lotion on and does like a

144
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,520
double like hands spread like if you

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,759
could give a caveman one thing from

146
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
Modern time to like absolutely blow his

147
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,520
socks off what would it be cuz I already

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,199
know mine would be I was think I can't

149
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,680
say my first

150
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:57,600
either vibrator doildo no we're in the

151
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,600
same ballpark same here what

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,120
would I think would blow a caveman's

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
socks off like literally not even blow

154
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,880
them off deteriorate them right there

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,360
what

156
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,080
wait what caveman doesn't wear socks

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
that's my point that's my whole point we

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,120
should bring him fuzzy socks regular

159
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,960
cavan there's no grooming back then and

160
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,280
they were like just so covered in hair

161
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,599
like a caveman probably had like really

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,199
hairy

163
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,080
feet I've never cut my feed hair in my

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,080
life I have no I don't I have I would

165
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
never do that I don't do that I don't

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
have like was what I was saying like I

167
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,240
would bring to a caveman if I wanted to

168
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,280
shock a caveman like IM can I [ __ ]

169
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,960
say it go say it you're edging me no not

170
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,360
every time I get there I'm being edged

171
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,639
me go I would bring a caveman a lighter

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,800
cuz they're always like o fire like

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,639

a book like a vintagey book with like

351
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,839
brown papers shuffling quickly through

the pages and like a map with like red

353
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,839

360
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,480
by side when Chris says the other day I

361
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,839
see a passage into an otherworldly Vis

362
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,440
immediately Vis the other day can be 10

363
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,759
days ago and the second the second we're

364
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
double digits stop saying the other day

365
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,040
I agree got it but go ahead the other

366
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,639
day mon ago when we were doing our let's

367
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,320
trip shoot we went into a gas station

368
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,480
and I think it's unbelievably funny how

369
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,880
amused Nick was by the minimal art Det I

370
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,720
walked into the gas station I felt like

371
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,680
I was at Disney world like it literally

372
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
it had like a painted M&M and then like

373
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,680
madebe like a mountain ni was like this

374
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,639
is so cool yeah cuz when I usually go

375
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,480
into a gas station there's a crack

376
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,639
addict and a [ __ ] one cooler of half

377
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,199
empty soda I go and they had good snack

378
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,160
choice in some beautiful arts of course

379
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm tell me your average gas station

380
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,279
experience you took a photo of it it was

381
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,839
on a story it was a big deal it was sick

382
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,040
I agree was beaming across it was like

383
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,399
comically funny how like blown away he

384
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,880
was by it it was a sick gas station it

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,600
was fun yeah I was in Florida I feel

386
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,800
like a kid the other day I was in my

387
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,759
room crossing my eyes how many days ago

388
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
this is actually like 3 days ago cool

389
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,759
crossing your eyes so you're just in

390
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,399
your room like this yes like I was I

391
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,240
have a chronic fear of ending up cross I

392
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,320
was doing this thing like this I was

393
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,240
doing the little kid thing like this and

394
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
listen I have this take little kid thing

395
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,880
yeah you know the little kid thing where

396
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,079
like f your finger and you're like this

397
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,360
and you like you get crosed I was doing

398
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,360
it the other night was doing it the

399
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,160
other night and I was thinking I think

400
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,399
it's crazy how when I was younger with

401
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,639
ease I could cross the uncross like I

402
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,800
could just be like this in my room like

403
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,199
when I was younger but the older I get

404
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,160
the more risk and reward I think there

405
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,480
is to crossing my eyes like I think I'm

406
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,120
going to do it one day and they're never

407
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,120
going to return because I'm old now

408
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,079
and it feels it feels a little like it

409
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,800
feels like it's like Rusty it's e good

410
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,880
to be friends with this kid had he had

411
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,399
like an aunt or a mom who was crossy and

412
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,480
like when crossy I'm the worst ever when

413
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,720
when they when you cross your eyes and

414
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
people are like oh don't do that or

415
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,639
they'll end up like that they stay like

416
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,319
that if that's not true I feel if it's

417
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,199
not true that your eyes can end up like

418
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:24,319
that if you cross them too much I feel

419
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,880
so bad for that lady cuz I remember so

420
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,040
many kids in school used to like cross

421
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,120
their eyes and then people be like oh

422
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,240
don't do it or like you'll end end up

423
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,639
cross out like permanently that's what

424
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,680
happened to so and so's mom and then she

425
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,600
would be like yeah like that's what

426
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,360
happened to me so if it's not true she's

427
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,199
putting on this major front of like

428
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,680
pretending that like she did it by

429
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,199
accident no but it does feel like it

430
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,199
could get stuck easier nowadays if I got

431
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,759
pulled over I'd fail a a sobriety test

432
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,759
sober probably cuz like most people

433
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,279

514
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,960

515
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,080
through the metal detector and I had my

516
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:09,559
arms up like this and I thought to

517
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:12,400
myself imagine a boogie filled sneeze at

518
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,360
TSA before getting metal detected like

519
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,640
you just put all of your stuff down you

520
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,039
don't have a tissue you don't have

521
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,600
anything to like cover yourself you're

522
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,440
wearing like a shirt and shorts why

523
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,880
talking and you sneeze and you have like

524
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,280
boogies on your face but you're like

525
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,600
three in line from getting metal oh my

526
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,720
God what do you do like a boogie covered

527
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,760
face while you wait to get metal

528
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,679
detected I just request to go to like

529
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,760
the private room or something the guy oh

530
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,200
my god the guy fondled my nuts at

531
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,080

quick PSA that's what it is right yeah

552
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,120
PSA PSA public if you ever meet me at

553
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,600
the airport I'm sorry from you you met

554
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,279
me at my most miserable State cuz that's

555
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,799
my least favorite place on Earth the TSA

556
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,880
guy and like the having like the

557
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,320
security of like needing to like I went

558
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,840
through the TSA metal detector and there

559
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,120
was a big red square on my dick and

560
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
balls and they had to they had to check

561
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,799
of course to see if I have a gun but

562
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,640
like even with the level of

563
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,960
fondling I was like if I did have

564
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,080
something in my balls or buy my balls

565
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,159
that I shouldn't I don't think you would

566
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,679
have like I think you got a like I was

567
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,440
like by the way the amount I got touched

568
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,679
I was like if I was hiding a little

569
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,679
secret between my

570
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,320
like you know I was like I don't think

571
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,360
you would have got it sir totally get it

572
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,720
you know totally get it and that's just

573
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,039
the thought especially in the

574
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,400
trunk I was like I don't know if you did

575
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,559
enough for

576
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,559
the my favorite thing in recent time has

577
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,360
been people like adults figuring out

578
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,520
like brain rot stuff and like that my

579
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,320
God have you seen the video of the guy

580
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,279
and he like the mom is is chill but like

581
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,279
the dad's got to read the

582
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,000
script the mom is like this is so skibby

583
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,320
Duke Dennis R like then they're at like

584

dad and like it's so but I just love

586
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,320
that it's gotten to a point of like I

587
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,000
thought we were all in on the joke of

588
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,480
like oh brain like this how you talk to

589
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,919

yeah like y'all are for real with this

595
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,679
to some degree yeah well you have to

596
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,400
think about it like this is like I want

597
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,559
to shoot myself in the head saying this

598
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,520
you have to think about it it's like

599
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,200
it's this generation's like like I can't

600
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,440
even be on camera when I say this like

601
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,880
like the like the white Vans thing like

602
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,440
the Daniel white van that's those

603
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,000
Generations like that you know what I

604
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,840
mean the other day me man and Chris went

605
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,760
out and we were filming a YouTube video

606
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,039
on the way home I fell asleep in the car

607
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,720
and Matt and Chris when I woke up told

608
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,400
me I was just the most peaceful sleeper

609
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,760
on no well we were talking about how

610
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,000
like when something with a lot of energy

611
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,080
and

612
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,520
and so it's very the key of physics is

613
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,960
an object in motion stage and motion and

614
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,919
an energy full of kinetic

615
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,400
speed well basically what we saying you

616
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,080
are the opposite of kinetic speed Noti

617
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,960
slow [ __ ] noticed a very peaceful

618
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,240
change in Nick when he's asleep and it

619
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,679
was just it was just very easy to be

620
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,159
around around him and it was very

621
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,960
interesting and I was like wow no Nick

622
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,000
fell asleep and me and Nick me and Matt

623
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,760
were actually like looking at him asleep

624
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,440
didn't notice yeah these people are like

625
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,320
going crazy actually the other day we

626
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,840
were um what were we talking about hold

627
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,039
on we got interrupted cuz we thought we

628
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,080
were getting followed Nick fell asleep

629
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,320
the other day in the car and me and Matt

630
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,600
were just laughing and talking about it

631
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,080
because Nick carries himself with such

632
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:29,679
emotion and such conversation and such

633
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,440
like high energy when he sleeps it's

634
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,679
actually the most peaceful thing you'll

635
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,840
ever see in your life because it I just

636
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,159

monster planes going by in the sky is

670
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,360
the most put a beat on it

671
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,279
unbelievable thing we don't ever think

672
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,679
or talk about as humans imagine way back

673
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,200
when there when there was dinosaurs when

674
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,360
there was dinosaurs imagine like we are

675
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,080
in the modern time of which I could be

676
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,720
outside in a park in the middle of the

677
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:38,520
woods and an aircraft vessel carrying

678
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,080
human beings from one part of this Earth

679
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,039
to the other can float above me and it's

680
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:49,039
so normal for us to see planes flying by

681
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,279
think of that think of how crazy it is

682
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:55,399
that I could be in the woods [ __ ]

683
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,360
bird watching and cloud seeeing like

684
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:01,480
this and a plane could go by and I would

685
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,919
not think for a [ __ ] second what is

686
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,799
that also let me just say that such and

687
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,200
people are like oh AI is scary all this

688
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:13,240
new technology is crazy we already live

689
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,000
amongst the planes let me say this I

690
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,200
think it's a good thing to not crazy

691
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,440
that Nick is the most

692
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,480
stereotypical motion person of movement

693
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,640
or character or pose like and what the

694
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,640
[ __ ] and does that even [ __ ] mean are

695
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,600
confused this is what I mean dude I feel

696
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,960
like how how to cartoon sleep Matt how

697
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,440
to cartoon

698
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:43,000
sleep like this that's a Nick sleep pose

699
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,960
how do cartoons relax like this or like

700
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,279
this like Nick is a cartoon of a human

701
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,360
being like you could Google like 50

702
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:53,559
human poses to draw and it's probably my

703
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,519
default yeah every every time don't cry

704
00:27:53,559 --> 00:28:01,000
about it was horse a big horse in your

705
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,000

livers explode I want to wake up in a
