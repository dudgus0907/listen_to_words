1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,600
And we're live. Yeah. All right. All

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,320
right, guys. Um, welcome back. Holy

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,320
absolutely macaroni. We have not filmed

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,759
a car video. We have not filmed a car

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,160
video together in three weeks, I think.

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,880
In about over 3 weeks. And this is our

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,199
first car video filming

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
since we were apart for 5 days when you

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,960
guys went to Summer Smash. Correct. So,

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,560
this is going to be a lethal car video.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
Guys, I just want to say before we even

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,719
get into the meat and potatoes of this

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
video, but doesn't he always make fun of

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,559
me for saying meat and potatoes? Meat

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
and potatoes. But anyway, potatoes.

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,239
We're starting to do more ventures. Like

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
me and Chris went to Summer Smash this

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,680
and that. So, we're going to start

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
trying to like make more content and do

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,440
stuff like that. Just Friday's the day.

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,879
You'll see something. Just don't worry

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,399
about it. I don't know how to word it.

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,160
Yeah, but we we're trying to like do

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,039
more adventures and stuff and obviously

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,120
that means less time together

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,840
and more time living life, which is good

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,359
and more good for stories. Speaking of g

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,120
gathering stories while we're not

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,559
together, that is what today's car video

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
is probably going to be honestly all

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
about. We're going to share a bunch of

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
stuff that happened while we were

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,960
separated. So, let's get right into

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
[ __ ] into it, guys. Also, I have my

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,119
sunglasses on and I felt like I really

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,200
needed to share, especially to Nick. My

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,439
biggest fear ever like do you know

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,560
biggest your biggest fear ever? You say

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,960
biggest. Okay. I know like NY's birds

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
whatever. Okay cool. Like we've had so

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,159
much conversation about biggest fears

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
and like I've brought up like things

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,960
here and there like oh having a

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,960
girlfriend like haha so funny. But I

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
genuinely found my new biggest fear. My

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,400
house just exploded. And why do you

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
think like while I'm inside? Cuz I think

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
like there are so many times where like

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,960
if like the pipes are wrong in the house

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,720
or like the furnace is on or like the

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
furnace. We don't have a furnace. We

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,920
don't live in a furnace. Almost every

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,560
house has a furnace. A furnace? Yes. You

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,720
have to move a boat like they throw coal

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,520
in like the Titanic. No. No. If you have

56
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,799
central AC central AC and central air,

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,719
you probably have a furnace. That's what

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,159
makes the heat. How common are furnaces

59
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,440
in modern day? Um huge. Even like your

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,239
oven leaking like like gas. Like my

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,640
biggest fear is just like my house

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
exploding. Yeah, I can. I don't think

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,440
your house is going to [ __ ] explode.

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,520
Like imagine like just the roof like

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,360
pops off and then like and then it's

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
like boom, your walls go off. I wish my

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
house would explode. Like a cartoon

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,879
explosion. Like the roof just flies off

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,640
and lands back on and then it's just

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,720
like all 2x4s and they all just like

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
fall

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
like recreate. No, but that's actually

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,080
my biggest fear is just like I saw a

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
video. He's saying it like you. I'm

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,920
saying biggest. Biggest. Uh I saw this

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
video. This kid was walking home with

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,519
his friend and they're like dribbling a

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,200
basketball on the sidewalk. Dribbling.

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
You're You're having a speech moment.

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. No, I'm not.

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,360
They're dribbling a basketball by a

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
house and as they walk by like the

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,360
[ __ ] front door flies. Dribble the

84
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
basketball by the house. It's like and

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
the house just like the house just blows

86
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
up and you see the kids like run away in

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
fear. That's terrible. So, it just made

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,319
me think like it inspired me to like

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,560
share my biggest fear. I can keep going.

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,239
I have more. I can keep going with

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
something. Matt, Nick, do you want to

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,879
tell Matt about your f your take the

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,040
other day? Your hot take when me and you

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
were out with Sam driving around. Can't

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,920
remember it. I have so many great hot

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,599
takes. We were me and Sam and Nick were

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
driving around and shopping. So, me and

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,920
Sam were just having a lot of

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
conversation back and forth. We're

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
driving around for a little bit. Nick's

101
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,840
in the back seat quiet for probably like

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
20 minutes. Shocker. And then we drive

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,080
by a fancy restaurant and there was an

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
ambulance outside of it. Okay, I

105
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
remember my take. I think there was an

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
ambulance outside of the fancy

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,280
restaurant and there was a bunch of like

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
people inside and people walking in and

109
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
out with like their suits and ties on.

110
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
Like it was like a nice fancy

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
restaurant. Now that I'm remembering

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,319
what you're going to say, I'm already

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,959
disagreeing with my with my previous and

114
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
Nick. This is a quote that I wrote down.

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,080
I can't believe that you can have a

116
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,599
heart attack in fancy clothes. And he

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
basically think of like having a heart

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,760
attack. It's like I think if you are

119
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,519
able to get into a nice outfit and like

120
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,000
do your hair and makeup and like get

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,120
like all dressed up, it has to be harder

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,760
to have a heart attack. And that was if

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,519
you can get yourself and bring yourself

124
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,600
and put yourself together really really

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,519
nice and you can look super good. I feel

126
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
like your heart attack like levels are

127
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,160
lower. You know what I mean? like if

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,520
you're lazy. And this started a whole

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
thing. Like we were talking about it for

130
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
like an half hour. Then we started

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,160
driving by people and Nick was like,

132
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,680
"Oh, he's safe. Like look at his hat."

133
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
And there was like a guy who like looked

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,199
messy and he's like he definitely could

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,479
probably This is insane. No, like this

136
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
is literally what Nick was saying, but I

137
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,919
was thinking to myself, it's like I feel

138
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,919
like it has to be relatively hard to

139
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,320
have like a heart attack in like a gown

140
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,240
or like a suit. Okay. You know what I

141
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
mean? No, Nick was just saying like

142
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
looking good and having a fancy suit on

143
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,160
like lowers your probability for all

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,479
injury like in general is what Nick was

145
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
saying. I think so. I believe that.

146
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,160
Okay. Sure. Do you believe that or

147
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,840
disagree? I disagree. I feel like it it

148
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
takes so much out of me to say like,

149
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
"Huh?" when someone's talking. Yeah. No,

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,919
it doesn't. No, it doesn't. That's like

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
you're a classic.

152
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
The reason I probably wrote this down

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,120
and the reason I probably thought this

154
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,800
is because you are always like, "You

155
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,280
heard what I said." But it's like if I

156
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,240
say huh and you say I heard you heard

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,520
what I said. You're a [ __ ] [ __ ] Cuz

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,199
I'm saying huh cuz I have no [ __ ]

159
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
clue what you're saying to me. I will

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,039
say over and over, huh? Huh? What are

161
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
you saying? Because I want to know what

162
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
you're saying, but I just have no

163
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
[ __ ] idea. You just don't listen.

164
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
You're not a good listener. Oh my god.

165
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,919
You're not a good listener. Oh my god.

166
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,320
No. You talk. I say, "Huh?" Cuz you

167
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,720
mumble and talk

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,639
and I go, "Hum." And you're like, "What?

169
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
What the [ __ ] Ever. Chris did this to

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,520
me in the house. No, cuz you double huh.

171
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,440
Like I double h if I didn't, Nick. You

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
double hump. No, I didn't. He was

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
talking to me. I said, "I'm not

174
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,400
listening to you." That was a blatant

175
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not listening. I'm telling you a

176
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
story and I'm like waiting for him to

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
respond and he goes, "Yeah, everything

178
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
you just said, I didn't listen to." And

179
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,840
then I walk away. Obviously, I'm not

180
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,880
going to continue to talk to someone who

181
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
just said that to me. I was being

182
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
honest. Did he want me to pretend I

183
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,199
heard it? He goes, "No, what'd you say?

184
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Like resay it?" And I'm like, "No, I

185
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
just spoke for [ __ ] 3 minutes. It was

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,479
full honesty. No, it wasn't. No. Well, I

187
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,880
was driving earlier to pick you up over

188
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,280
there and Nick was in the passenger seat

189
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,600
and I said something to Nick. No,

190
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
silence was my correct. You don't even

191
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
know what I said. So, I was just like,

192
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
"Okay, whatever. I'll try again later."

193
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
I don't know if we show shared this on

194
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
the internet already yet, but me and

195
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,800
Matt are leaving Chicago and we're in

196
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,960
the elevator of the hotel going down to

197
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
the lobby and our flight's not for 6

198
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,759
hours and he's asking me in the

199
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,080
elevator. See, Matt, say that. I just

200
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
said that. Did he? You're not a good

201
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,120
listener. And Matt goes, "Do you think I

202
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,120
should take my belt off at TSA? Am I in

203
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,199
Am I at TSA?" I'm like, "No, I'm in the

204
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,680
elevator of the [ __ ] hotel." Well, I

205
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
I was trying to be productive in like 6

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
hours in advance. He's asking me if he

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,160
should remove his belt at TSA, which I

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
understand. Wow. We Well, yeah. I just I

209
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
feel like there's listen to the guy. We

210
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
had a full day ahead of us. TSA people

211
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,319
will not hesitate to tell you what the

212
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
[ __ ] you need to do. We went out to eat.

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
We went to the Lyrical Lemonade

214
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
headquarters. We saw some friends. We

215
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,919
played basketball. Like, there was a

216
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,599
full day that conspired between You're a

217
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
[ __ ] idiot. How about this little How

218
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,160
about this little interaction I had with

219
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
Chris the other day? If we're going to

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
talk about people being stupid where

221
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,199
we're driving by a semi-truck and he

222
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,759
looks, gasps, you were in the car,

223
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,039
looks, gasps, points at it, and I wrote

224
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,599
down and I quote, he goes, "This looks

225
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,919
just like it's from the movie Cars." And

226
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,919
he's going like this. He's like pointing

227
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
at the car and he goes, "This looks just

228
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,319
like it's from the movie Cars." It was

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,280
probably And then he goes he he goes,

230
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,880
"Look, it's Mac and it's a [ __ ]

231
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,120
18-wheeler truck." I said, "Chris,

232
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,680
wait till you find out what the movie

233
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,240
Cars is based off of. Just you [ __ ]

234
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
wait." He literally points an 18-wheeler

235
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
with both his hands like this, like a

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,879
like an animal. Like

237
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
shock pointing. Look, it looks just like

238
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
it's from the movie Cars. It's like he's

239
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,039
seeing like the real actor of the

240
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,440
[ __ ] movie. It's a truck. It was an

241
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,199
18-wheeler truck.

242
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,720
Are you crazy? Of course it does. And so

243
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,120
does the car you're in and every other

244
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,960
car on the [ __ ] road. Are you

245
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,720
unfamiliar with life is a [ __ ]

246
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,720
highway. Here we are. Life is a highway.

247
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
We're here. Oh my god, Nick, you're too

248
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,599
funny. No, but speaking of also being on

249
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
the road, while Matt and Chris were

250
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,680
gone, I still was living my own life.

251
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,839
But being a 20-year-old, I cannot drive

252
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,839
a car, which is so embarrassing. And I

253
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,399
was getting in so many I was getting in

254
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
so many Ubers. I have at least four Uber

255
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
stories to share with you. No, me and

256
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Matt were dying laughing when you texted

257
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,399
us that you and the Uber driver had the

258
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
identical outfit on. Oh my god. I I took

259
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
a video. I took a video cuz I was

260
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,200
shocked. We were both wearing a black

261
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,560
shirt and like funky like sunglasses and

262
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
I was like, "This is the funniest." No.

263
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,519
And blue shorts. You had head to toe.

264
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,500
No, I recorded the guy and record

265
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,640
myself. Insert insert clip right now.

266
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,240
[Music]

267
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
Oh my god, it was so funny. But me and

268
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,959
the Uber driver were matching. There was

269
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
another time I got in like an Uber like

270
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
six times just going about. I got in a

271
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,640
car and the guy asked me where to go. I

272
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
got in the car. He goes, "Which way do

273
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
you usually go?" I said, "Uber, sir, I

274
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,560
can't drive." I literally said, "Mr.

275
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Uber, I cannot drive." Mr. Uber is

276
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
crazy. I was like, "I don't know which

277
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,240
way to go. Follow the GPS." And then,

278
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,320
no, no, hold on.

279
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,360
Was that a tiger? It's a car. I also I

280
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,279
also not of course there's not a tiger.

281
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,680
Like why would there be a tiger coming

282
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,720
to jump at us before give me a tissue

283
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,640
right now. Life is a high.

284
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm going to ride it all night long.

285
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
Another thing is I was uh you guys were

286
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
gone for 5 days and I didn't go out

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
until the second day. So I was

288
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,000
completely alone with my thoughts in

289
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,680
silence for like 48 hours and like I had

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
no one to speak to. Why? I was

291
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399
completely alone. I got into the Uber

292
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
and he goes, "Hello, how are you?" I

293
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
said, "Hi, how are you?" And then he was

294
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
like, we had like a one minute

295
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,600
conversation, I felt like a primal

296
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
animal speaking like I was like, the way

297
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
that I can communicate with this person,

298
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,240
like I had not communicated with anyone

299
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,640
like face to face, verbally in like 48

300
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,720
hours. So speaking to him and like using

301
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,320
our words to communicate literally made

302
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,399
me feel like an animal. Like it was like

303
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,480
back to the basics. I felt like I was

304
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,480
like You felt like a kid. I was like I

305
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
felt like it was my first words. The

306
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,079
fact that I spoke and he understood me

307
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
made me feel like literally primal. I

308
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,279
was like in You want to know what I've

309
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,040
discovered is that I'm the only triplet

310
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,160
that hasn't been away from you guys for

311
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,839
more than 24 hours. Yeah. I feel bad for

312
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,440
you. You need it. No, I've I've

313
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
literally never been away from either of

314
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
you for more than 24 hours. You've been

315
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
away from us for more than 24. You've

316
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,399
been away from us for more than 24. Mhm.

317
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah. I've yet to do that. Like I've

318
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,760
never slept in like an empty home. I

319
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
worry for you. It's important for you to

320
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,560
do that. It is. It is important. And

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,040
that's why we have this new era of life.

322
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,040
Why don't you guys go do something? No,

323
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,959
we will go on a date or something. Go Oh

324
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,680
my god. Take a couple trip to Morocco.

325
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,279
We're not going to do that. What is that

326
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,040
all about? No, like both of you could go

327
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,320
somewhere that I kind of like want to go

328
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,079
and I'll miss out a little and that

329
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
would make it even more of a good mental

330
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,760
adventure for me cuz you guys mental

331
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
adventure. Like you guys could send

332
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,040
photos with like coconuts and nice

333
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,320
necklaces. Do you even know where

334
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,560
Morocco is geographically? Yeah. Where?

335
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,480
Isn't it near

336
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,079
Panama? That's why I ask him. He might

337
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,079
be spot on. He might be, but I might.

338
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,519
Anyways, moving on. Also, another thing

339
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,320
I've noticed is I've never in my life

340
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,000
had like aux on the car with like no

341
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
judgment. Like, I've never been able to

342
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,320
like hit shuffle or play on my songs and

343
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,079
like have neither of you complain about

344
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
it or have either of you be in control.

345
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,680
Well, you also can't drive.

346
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
So, you're going to be judged because

347
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,079
you're playing for music for somebody

348
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,320
that's also in the vehicle. So, you've

349
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,040
never been or had a moment in a vehicle

350
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
alone. So, obviously there's room for

351
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,800
judgment because there's a crowd and

352
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,880
you're putting on an audio for everyone

353
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,480
to listen to. You could say that for me

354
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,320
and you could say that for Chris because

355
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,519
we're always playing something that

356
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
they're going to get three different

357
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,040
opinions from different categories cuz

358
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
you like pop music and Chris likes

359
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,560
hip-hop and I'm more on the indie side

360
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,320
most of the time. So, the fact that So

361
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,760
are you. So there's going to be

362
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
judgment. I feel like I'm with like

363
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,680
narrator smurf right now. Yeah,

364
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
literally. Okay. Thank you for literally

365
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,720
saying what I said. I got into the Uber

366
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,160
and I like I think you felt like

367
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,639
something telling you to do that. Like

368
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,519
there was a commending force to get.

369
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,079
Anyways, commending force. I I got into

370
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,880
the Uber and I asked him for a a a

371
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,880
charger and I plug my phone in and he

372
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, Bluetooth, too."

373
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
And I was like like I was like frozen in

374
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
fear. I was like I've never done this

375
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,600
before. I I started playing like oldies

376
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,200
like good songs and he was quiet for 30

377
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
minutes and I we were on the highway and

378
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
whenever I'm in a long Uber I play color

379
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
by numbers. I'm not like looking around.

380
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm just like I'm chilling. I'm on my I

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
have my head up in the clouds, you know?

382
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,360
You're really like you're role playing

383
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,600
like a six-year-old when you go out.

384
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
Color by numbers, old music. Yeah, I

385
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
guess like I was playing old music and I

386
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
was doing my color by numbers. We're a

387
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,720
half hour into the ride and neither me

388
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,720
or the Uber man has said a word. A word.

389
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,279
And all of a sudden over the music he

390
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,519
goes, "All good songs, my friend." Like

391
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
all like he went to compliment my ax and

392
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,200
he goes, "Oh." Like when he said all, I

393
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
thought he was like going, "Ah." So I

394
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,639
literally I dropped my phone and I like

395
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,440
shoot my head up. I thought that I was

396
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,959
going to [ __ ] eat the highway. Like I

397
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
thought when he said all good songs to

398
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,279
my friend, he went to compliment me that

399
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,600
my body was about to go [ __ ] flying

400
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,440
out of the window cuz he was shouting

401
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,200
when he like he was being nice, but it

402
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
was like he hadn't said a word yet. So

403
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,000
when he yelled, I literally was

404
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,320
preparing for my body to break through

405
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,399
glass and glide across the highway. I

406
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
was in a state of shock. I was in a

407
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,880
state of shock. I literally What did you

408
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,920
say? So what did you say? Oh, I

409
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
literally took a deep breath, I think,

410
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
and picked up my phone. I was like, "Oh,

411
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
thank you." But I was like I was

412
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,639
literally in [ __ ] shock cuz the way

413
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,800
he did it I think he was just so shocked

414
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,519
that I wasn't playing like rap music as

415
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,440
a teen boy that like all good songs all

416
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,920
good songs my friend and I was like oh

417
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,399
my god like I jumped when we were

418
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,560
leaving Chicago through the airport the

419
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,360
girl like at the TSA booth that like

420
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,199
scans my ID Uhhuh. like knew who we

421
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
were. She I think she like noticed it

422
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,480
once she saw me but like she saw Matt

423
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
was like hesitant about it but then when

424
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
she saw both of us she's like oh cuz

425
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,680
Matt went in line ahead of me remember

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
and Matt scans this thing and he walks

427
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,680
through and then I give her my ID and

428
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,079
she goes wait you're like Chris Sternolo

429
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,959
right? I go yeah she's oh my god I love

430
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,279
you guys and like hands me my passport

431
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,760
and like she didn't scan it through the

432
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
machine and yeah and then she was like

433
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,399
oh like I love you guys like nice to see

434
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,320

435
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,959
oh yeah yeah you're good. So, like I got

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
noticed by the lady, so I like didn't

437
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,320
like check in for the I didn't need my

438
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,160
pass. I could have I could have walked

439
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
right through. I think that's illegal.

440
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,880
And I think she could be fired from her.

441
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
No, like definitely like because she

442
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,519
noticed who I am. She just was like,

443
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
"Oh, yeah, you're good." And like let me

444
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
through the airport. I didn't need I

445
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,560
didn't need a like I didn't she didn't

446
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,639
even need my passport. Like she never

447
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,920
even grabbed me. Like I went to hand it

448
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
to her and she's like, "Wait, you're

449
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,959
Chris Hill." I go, "Yeah." She go,

450
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,959
"Okay, you're good." I think if I spent

451
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,680
48 hours at the airport, I'd have enough

452
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,079
car video content for a year. airport.

453
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,600
The amount of psychopaths are just dumb

454
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,240
people that are at the airport is

455
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,240
insane. I hate the summer. I just got to

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
say it. My nose has been peeling. I got

457
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,800

How many times and did we ever go see

The Nutcracker in Boston? Like the

493
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,079
Christmas musical?

494
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:02,079
Never. You never brought us to see it.

495
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,400
No, I think there was a field trip. Yes,

496
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,720
that's Chris is claiming that he went

five times and me and Matt said no.

498
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,559
We've been He's dreaming. You saw Lily

499
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,120
in the purple plastic purse. I remember

500
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,520
that. That was a good one. You know, I

501
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,000
never took you to the Nutcracker.

502
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,880
All right. I didn't think you guys were

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,799
into it. Yeah.

504
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,520
Apparently, Chris is Yeah. I mean, it's

505
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,679
a ballet. You guys didn't strike me as

506
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
the ballet kind of kids. I didn't I'm

507
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,039
not I'm really don't think we are

508
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,559
either. All right. Thank you so much for

509
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,240
that information. I'll call you again

510
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,000
soon.

511
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,960
All right. I'm going to bed. Good night,

512
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,480
Mom. Love you. So you how do you feel,

513
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
you [ __ ] idiot? So how many times

514
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,760
have you seen the Nutcracker? I guess

515
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,679
I've only seen it once, but I feel like

516
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I've seen it more than once. Like I feel

517
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,919
like I've I've heard about I don't even

518
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,360
think I've seen it once. I think I think

519
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,559
we went on a school field trip, but I

520
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,240
think Matt might not have gone. Yeah,

521
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
I've never seen it. I think that I've

522
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,600
been at least three times like with

523
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
friends or something. Like I I don't

524
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
know why I'm so compelled by this, but I

525
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
feel like I've been. But the whole point

526
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,640
of me bringing this up, Lily in the

527
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,080
plastic purse, that was a good one. I

528
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,440
remember I don't remember that. I

529
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,039
remember. But the whole point of me

530
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,360
bringing this up is I feel like I've

531
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,760
seen it like five times, but I could not

532
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,559
tell you a thing of what it's about cuz

533
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,320
you've never been once. I literally It's

534
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,679
a ballet. We were driving down the

535
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
street and I saw an ad and it was like

536
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
the Nutcracker and I was like, I've been

537
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
to that like two times and I have no

538
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,880
idea. Now it's two. Matt, do you have

539
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,760
any compelling stories that happened to

540
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,559
you while we were all separated?

541
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,240
Um, not really honestly. Nothing too.

542
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,919
I'm trying to Well, I feel like I could

543
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,600
if I think about it, but I don't know.

544
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,600
Isn't buying a wallet such an

545
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,280
interesting thing to do? It's like,

546
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
where was your money before? Like,

547
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
exactly. You want to know what my like I

548
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,160
hate piggy banks. You want to know what

549
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
I've realized? You want to know what

550
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,240
I've realized? One of my like um issues

551
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,200
or something that I'm going to run into

552
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,320
a problem with all the time 24/7. What?

553
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,120
Being too full? Yes. But also, it's like

554
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,480
I need to constantly drink water to be

555
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,760
hydrated and not feel like I'm going to

556
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,160
pass out. But I have to pee. I have to

557
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,840
pee every 20 minutes if I drink a

558
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
bottle. It's ridiculous. It's the most

559
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,160
ridiculous thing ever cuz we're at the

560
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,559
festival in Chicago. It's 90 something

561
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,440
degrees. I'm cranking down water bottles

562
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,120
like they're [ __ ] Dixie cups and

563
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
nothing you can do. And I'm pissing all

564
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,200
the time. We need more public. I'm just

565
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
like all my friends are like, "Oh my

566
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
god, dude. like you're holding us up and

567
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,760
I'm like no one's saying that to you.

568
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
Well, like they're not saying that, but

569
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
like I I'm getting that vibe. Like I

570
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,799
feel like I'm like such a terrible viol.

571
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
I feel like just standing up and being

572
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,480
like, "Hey guys, I'm going to the

573
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,039
bathroom again." You know, I'm in a I'm

574
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,640
in a constant state of having to piss.

575
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,160
That's like who I am. It's ridiculous.

576
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,360
It's so ridiculous. But I don't know

577
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,760
what's up. Maybe it's cuz we're

578
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,679
triplets, so it shrunk all our bladders.

579
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,200
Don't say that.

580
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,039
That's a good That's a good point,

581
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,440
though. Why Why do I feel Maybe all of

582
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,440
our organs are tinier. Ew, don't say

583
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,280
that. That's why I'm so skinny. But I

584
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,440
have a big heart. Yes. I love seeing

585
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,000
like a dog get some water at like a dog

586
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,600
park. Like Yes. [ __ ] get that water.

587
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
You really feel that way? Just you, huh?

588
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Go hydr. Have you seen the scientific

589
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,000
behind that? Yeah. Dogs scoop it up like

590
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,400
this. Insane. Have you seen this, Matt?

591
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,039
Yeah. Insane. I feel like I look like a

592
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,600
disgusting, sweaty, repulsive monster.

593
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,400
I'm right there with you. Internal temp

594
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,400
too high. Allow

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:53,010
