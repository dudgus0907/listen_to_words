00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,440
as always one is all the way over there

327
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,480
21 is this way Matt is going to take a

328
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,279
sip of each one and try to identify my

329
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,720
stomach hurts my stomach hurts bad still

330
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,680
I know that

331
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,680
one I think that that's Prime because

332
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,079
it has the consistency that the other

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
primes that I've had in the future

334
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,560
have the other the other Prime that I've

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,519
the consist the primes that I've had in

336
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,120
the past and it tastes like a flavor

337
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,880
that would be Prime and it doesn't have

338
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,800
like a I don't know Prime that's my

339
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,720
guess number one prime all right second

340
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,360
one that's some type of monster cuz I

341
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,199
can feel a little Bub but not but not

342
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,600
but not that that that much so we're

343
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,600

351
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,360
