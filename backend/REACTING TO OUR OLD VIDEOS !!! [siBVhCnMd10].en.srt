my I'm praying to God they do I

54
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,879
really wanted to do I really want to do

55
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,680
a death drop on Matt's bed but I'm

56
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,280
afraid that it'll break in half and I

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,519
don't want to deal with Matt complaining

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,080
forever yeah it would break you can do

59
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,760
it though it's already broken do you

was more filled with freedom cuz the

424
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,520
thing is at this point in our career I

425
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,320
felt so pushed to say whatever I was

426
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,000
thinking talking about oh if you have

427
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,280
crazy this this this but now there's so

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,360
many eyes on us all at once that I have

429
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,919
to limit what I say because if I say

430
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,159
something like I used to say and I'm so

431
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,280
blot like I am I'm going to accidentally

432
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,440
Target somebody and then they're going

433
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,400
to make a Tik Tok next JY Olo hates me

434
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,720
and it's not true I just be like I'm

435
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,400
suppressing myself cuz I don't want to

436
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,840
 cuz if that clip was posted in a

437
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,799
YouTube video nowadays I own a bunch of

438
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,520
Squish mows Nick hates me but it's like

439
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,000
that it's just my opinion it's a

440
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,200
joke it's a joke so it's like I need to

441
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,039
less I need to be less fearful when it

442
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,159
comes to joking we had to all let loose

443
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,159
no seriously

444
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,960
motivating it's motivating it's

445
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,960
motivating hwk why so

446
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,600
serious it it really is though like

447
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,600
motivating TR we used to literally say

448
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,280
anything on our mind Vlog anywhere and

449
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,720
let it roam free but nowadays we get so

450
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,480
scared of like like saying the wrong

451
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,960
thing hurting someone's feelings and I

452
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,000
don't give a to be totally honest W

453
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,559
the glow up is needs to be studied a

454
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,320
little bit for me no for of I that's the

455
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,679
thing though got I genuinely I sound

456
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,080
like a narcissist now but I felt so ugly

457
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,080
the entire time I was in Middle School

458
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,200
in high school so I allow myself to be a

459
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,000
narcissist now because I hated the way I

460
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,520
looked when I woke up every single day

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,799
and now I'm so aware that I truly am hot

462
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,360
as and it makes me so happy when I

463
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,000
was at the like I had the same haircut

464
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,280

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,520
little side and then Co grew out my

466
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,200
hair and I feel like haircuts Co is what

467
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,039
made it well I I just I literally feel

468
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,559
like I've had the exact same haircut for

469
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:13,200
