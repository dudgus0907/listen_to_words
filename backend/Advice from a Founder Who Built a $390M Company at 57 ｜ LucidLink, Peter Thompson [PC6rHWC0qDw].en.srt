1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,560
So were were there days when I regretted

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,639
taking the step to create our own

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,880
company? Yes, there were mainly nights

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,679
like dark nights when the demons come

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,839
out and things are really tough. No

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,160
funding, capital markets have dried up

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,560
and a short runway. I went out and I

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,960
started asking all my mentors and all of

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,119
the uh people for advice and they said,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,080
"Lay off everybody you can except just

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,160
the core people. protect the IP, live to

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,800
fight another day. George and I looked

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,399
at each other and

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,600
said, "That doesn't really align with

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,719
the core values that we said we were all

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
about. And if we don't use our core

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,440
values to make the hardest decision of

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,600
our life, then they're not really our

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,840
values." So, we said, "All right, we're

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
not going to do that." Instead, we got

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,399
the entire team together, about 25

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,600
people at the time. Uh we told them

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,079
exactly the what was going on. We asked

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,559
everybody to take deep cuts to have a

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,479
belief in the company and us to feel

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
figure out how we're going to weather

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,080
this storm and we ended up keeping

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,240
everybody. I don't think I slept during

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,240
that period. I mean, yeah, I closed my

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
eyes at night, but you know, it was just

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,560
terrible. It wasn't just me anymore. It

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,280
was 25 people and their families who had

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
a belief in what we were doing. And

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,240
during that time, that's when we did

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,400
find our product market fit. It was

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,840
during that time we got the first call

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,940
from A&D networks and they said, "Can

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:46,680
you help us?" And we said,

39
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:49,439
[Music]

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,640
"Yeah." My name is Pete Thompson. I'm

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,399
co-founder and CEO of Lucid Link. Lucid

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,600
Link transforms cloud storage into an

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,159
unlimited high-performance drive that

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,399
can be accessed from anywhere and

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,080
collaborated on with your team without

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,640
having to synchronize, download or ship

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,840
files around. Lucid Link has over a

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,319
100,000 active users now and we've grown

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,160
the business over the last few years

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,959
from effectively zero to over 40 million

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:29,800
in ARR. Our next stage is we're focusing

52
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,800
on that 50 to 100 million ARR milestone.

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,840
Embracing

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,319
ambiguity. That was one of the things I

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,200
think I learned early on in my life. I

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,599
was in a program to become a doctor. I

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,400
was in a premed program. I thought

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
that's what my path was. And it was just

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
by chance that I had this opportunity to

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,239
go to Japan. And as it turned out, it it

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,200
changed the trajectory of my life. after

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,840
I had spent a year of uh university

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,159
studying in Japan and just realized that

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,159
I wanted to do something in my career

65
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,280
that involved Japanese that I had

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,159
learned. So I joined data core as uh

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,760
employee number 20. My role in dataore

68
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,560
was to help them establish their

69
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,959
business in Asia Pacific. But in doing

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
so, I spent a lot of time traveling to

71
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,280
these areas and speaking to people and I

72
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,000
had to speak to them as the

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,920
representative of data core as a storage

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
expert. But there was a problem. I

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,959
wasn't a storage expert at the time. I

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,200
needed to be able to gain their trust. I

77
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
couldn't lie to them. I couldn't pretend

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,280
that I knew things I didn't. So, there

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
were a lot of very uncomfortable moments

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
where I was kind of right on that edge.

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,720
I knew I was slightly out of my element,

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,879
but I was honest about it at but at the

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,400
same time they realized, okay, he's

84
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,159
still, you know, we can we can trust

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
what he's saying. And gradually over

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,959
time and through a lot of uncomfortable

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,799
moments, I just that's how you learn.

88
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,599
You know, you push yourself out of your

89
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,799
comfort zone and you gradually one day

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,080
you wake up and you realize, you know

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
what, I kind of am an expert.

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,959
At some point while I was working at

93
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:19,840
dataore I realized that my job was

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,040
becoming easy for me. It became a little

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
bit repetitive. I wasn't growing and I

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,840
didn't have that feeling of challenge

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,840
anymore. So all of this told me it's

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,400
just time to move on. But I wasn't sure

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,639
how to move on. But uh it was at this

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,120
time that a friend of mine had gone

101
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,600
through the same program uh the Sloan

102
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,840
Fellowship program at Stanford. Well,

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,919
Mike and I were fishing buddies. So,

104
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,919
while you're sitting out on the ocean, I

105
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
learned more about the time he spent at

106
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
Stanford. And he finally said, you know,

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,440
this was you should just go there, do

108
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
this program, find a figure out

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,919
something to do and start a company. And

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,720
I said, "Huh, yeah, maybe I should. Let

111
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,720
me try that." And so I I was accepted

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,040
into the program and I went into it with

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,520
that. I said, "Okay, I I'm I've got one

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,759
year here. I want to address some things

115
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,000
that I want about myself, challenge

116
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,720
myself in in some uncomfortable

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,039
situations and either come up with an

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
idea or meet some people who have an

119
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,000
idea that I can join and start a company

120
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,840
from scratch." How old was I when I made

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,759
that decision? Uh I was 48. I was the

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,759
oldest person in the program.

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
How did it feel to go back to graduate

124
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,960
school after such a long time in the

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:45,440
workforce? It felt really uncomfortable,

126
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,520
but also it was amazing. I was worried

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,680
that the time was going to go too fast.

128
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,320
I was worried that after a year maybe I

129
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,440
didn't know what that next thing was

130
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,479
going to be. I felt I have to make the

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
best use of this

132
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:04,720
time. I think it was October or November

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
when I was in in the program. I didn't

134
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,479
know what I was going to do, although I

135
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,360
was certain that it would have nothing

136
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,039
to do with storage. That was the last

137
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
thing I thought I was going to do. All

138
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,840
of a sudden, my co-founder George called

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
me up. We didn't work very closely at

140
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,319
Dataore, but I knew him well because he

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,280
was the first engineer that they hired.

142
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,080
He was known to be a brilliant engineer.

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
He called me up and he said, "Hey, Pete,

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't know if you realize this, but I

145
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,960
left shortly after you did because I had

146
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,680
this idea in my head. I needed to get it

147
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,360
out of my brain and into code and see if

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,759
it had merit. Are you interested in

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,479
seeing what I built?" And I thought,

150
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,120
"Yeah, of course I am." He showed me a

151
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
demo that blew my mind after all those

152
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,639
years in storage. I said, "Wait a

153
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,479
minute. Is this just a demo or is this

154
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,560
actually happening live because this

155
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,800
shouldn't be possible? He said, "Look,

156
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,599
I'm I've got this idea. I'm looking for

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,599
some partners to help find investors to

158
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,319
grow the business, to do all of this,

159
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,479
and I'm at Stanford learning how to

160
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,160
start a business, get investors, know

161
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,160
how to build a business, and I'm looking

162
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,199
for an idea. This could be a perfect

163
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,199
combination. Tell you what, let's use

164
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,319
the rest of the time I have here at

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,000
Stanford and the resources, some of the

166
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
classes that are available to me to

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,479
really pressure test this idea. Let's

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,880
try to prove to ourselves that there's

169
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,759
nothing here. Let's try to disprove this

170
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,759
theory that there's a company in this

171
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,560
technology. The problem that we were

172
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,639
trying to solve was you've got large

173
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,880
sets of data and a whole bunch of people

174
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,440
that need to access it. Some of these

175
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,280
files within this data set are super big

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,599
and that makes it even more difficult.

177
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,840
Today you have two choices. You can move

178
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
the compute and the applications to

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,919
where the data is stored or you can move

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,319
the data and the files to where the

181
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,280
compute is running but they have to be

182
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,440
together. And most of the technology was

183
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,960
all based on either moving the data

184
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,440
faster or creating replicas of those

185
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,440
files so that they were next to the

186
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,840
applications. What we were doing was

187
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,400
something completely different. We said

188
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,199
keep the data stored where it is, keep

189
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,160
the compute running to where it is. We

190
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,039
will present it as if it is local and

191
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,319
our technology will solve the problems

192
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,240
around performance and collaboration. If

193
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,080
you can break that fundamental

194
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,880
difference or fundamental dependency on

195
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,120
an application requiring a file to be

196
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,279
right next to it, now you can make those

197
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
decisions separately. You can choose

198
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,320
where to store stuff based on place to

199
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,040
store it and you can choose where to run

200
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,399
your applications based on a separate

201
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,800
set of criteria. That unlocks all of the

202
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,640
productivity that we've been doing. But

203
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,959
first, we had to get funding. We knew

204
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,440
this was going to be a difficult and

205
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,519
highly technical product to build. So we

206
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
needed funding and we needed time. After

207
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,760
I graduated from Stanford, we began

208
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,120
pitching to VCs

209
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:12,080
and they all told us no. They all told

210
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,399
us it'll never work. It's a bad idea.

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,880
People won't pay for it. Even if you do

212
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,160
get build it, they won't care. There

213
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,959
were so many reasons not to invest in

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,360
it. And that was hard. Let me tell you,

215
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,519
venture capitalists are very smart. They

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,959
see a lot of great ideas. They have a

217
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,880
lot of success uh investing in

218
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,839
worldclass companies. So when they tell

219
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,040
you that your idea sucks, it's hard to

220
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,800
say you're wrong. But you have to you

221
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
have to believe you have to say that

222
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,519
there's something that they don't see.

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,839
There's something I know that they don't

224
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,760
know. They're a generalist. They see a

225
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,399
lot of things. I'm a specialist. I know

226
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,880
storage. I know this problem firsthand.

227
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,720
So, what was the problem? Maybe I'm not

228
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,800
uh pitching it correctly. Maybe I have

229
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,880
to change my story, you know. So, we

230
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,200
kept iterating on trying to figure this

231
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,800
out. Finally, after 33 rejections or 33

232
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,720
nos, we finally found an investor who

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,200
said, "I think there is something here."

234
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,079
And he was willing to invest in us. That

235
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,800
was Steve Anderson at Baseline Ventures.

236
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,240
He was well known for picking winners.

237
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,720
So the fact that he saw something here

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,320
really motivated us as well. So we got

239
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,360
funded and now we had to build the

240
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,560
product and it took 2 years to build

241
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,399
this

242
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,959
[Music]

243
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,120
product. From 2017 to 19 we were

244
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,959
building the product. From 2019 we

245
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,880
really had the product out and we were

246
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,800
trying to find the initial product

247
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,079
market fit. So we were getting close to

248
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,240
that in 2020. We had to go out and get

249
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,399
more funding. We weren't funding because

250
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
we had the metrics. We were funding

251
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,320
because we were running out of money.

252
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,560
Not a great position to be in. So we

253
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
knew that this was still going to be a

254
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,640
case where we are going to have to sell

255
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,640
vision. We were ready to to do that. We

256
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,040
got um a whole list of uh VC meetings

257
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,079
set up and on a Monday morning we were

258
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,560
driving up Sand Hill Road in early 2020

259
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,320
and suddenly we got a phone call and

260
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,760
they said, "Oh, hey, by the way, we're

261
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,079
going to have to cancel this meeting

262
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,240
today. Uh we're not allowed to take any

263
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,440
more in-person meetings. We're going to

264
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,160
put a pause on all new investments until

265
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
we kind of see how this CO thing is

266
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,079
going to shake out. It'll probably be

267
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,360
maybe two weeks or a month and then

268
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,279
we'll be back back to business as

269
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,200
normal. Well, we've got a couple hours

270
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,680
before our meeting in the afternoon.

271
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
Let's go to a coffee shop and work on

272
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,079
our pitch deck. So, we go to the coffee

273
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,320
shop and walk in and we get another call

274
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,279
the next meeting. Basically, the entire

275
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,680
week of VC meetings got wiped out in one

276
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,800
day. No funding. Capital markets have

277
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,920
dried up and a short runway. That was

278
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,519
kind of a moment we went,

279
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,000
"Uhoh, what have we done?" I went out

280
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,399
and I started asking all my mentors and

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,639
all of the uh people for advice and they

282
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,680
said, "Lay off everybody you can except

283
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,760
just a core people. Protect the IP. Live

284
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,639
to fight another day." George and I

285
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,399
looked at each other and said,

286
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,360
"Hm, that doesn't really align with the

287
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,399
core values that we said we were all

288
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,480
about. And if we don't use our core

289
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,440
values to make the hardest decision of

290
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,480
our life, then they're not really our

291
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,959
values. So we said, "All right, we're

292
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,040
not going to do that." Instead, we got

293
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,200
the entire team together, about 25

294
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,680
people at the time. We were very

295
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,959
transparent, which is one of our values.

296
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,279
Uh we told them exactly the what was

297
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,920
going on. We asked everybody to take

298
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,000
deep cuts to have a belief in the

299
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,880
company and us to feel figure out how

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,040
we're going to weather this storm and we

301
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,839
ended up keeping everybody. I don't

302
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,680
think I slept during that period. I

303
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,160
mean, yeah, I closed my eyes at night,

304
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,560
but you know, it was just terrible sleep

305
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,720
and there was a lot of pressure and it

306
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,800
wasn't just me anymore. It was 25 people

307
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,279
and their families who had a belief in

308
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,920
what we were doing. And during that

309
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,160
time, that's when we did find our

310
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,639
product market fit. It was during that

311
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:32,160
time we got the first call from A&D

312
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:34,160
Networks and they said, "So, we don't

313
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,079
know anything about your company, but

314
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,600
somebody over at Adobe said we should

315
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,480
call you. Um, we just sent home 80

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,720
engineers with a a laptop, a hard drive,

317
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
and a VPN connection, and that's

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
probably going to let us get through

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
about the next 2 weeks of production,

320
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,560
and then we're just not sure what we're

321
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,519
going to do. Can you help us? And we

322
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,680
said, "Yeah, yeah, that's exactly. We

323
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,279
can absolutely help you." So we set them

324
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,399
up on a P and they the P ended up

325
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,360
running from directly into production

326
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,360
and we closed them at nearly 100k ARR

327
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,199
contract. Now remember we our total ARR

328
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,160
at that time with 50 customers was

329
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,760
around 100K. So this was huge and it was

330
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,959
during that time that we got the next

331
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,560
call from Viacom CBS and then the third

332
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,639
call from Vice News. And all of them had

333
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,120
the same story, the same problem, the

334
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,160
same outcome. And at that point, we

335
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,680
said, "All right, we are no longer a

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,639
general file access platform. We are now

337
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,480
a creative content collaboration tool."

338
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,639
And that's when we went from 100K in ARR

339
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,360
to a million that first year and then

340
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:52,880
went from 1 to 5, 5 to 15, 15, 30, and

341
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,639
we're still going.

342
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,920
to people who haven't found their

343
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,399
product market fit or are trying to wait

344
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,480
for their opportunity to come. I guess

345
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,279
I'd say

346
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,120
believe. If you have done the work and

347
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
you know your product and you know the

348
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
market, you know there's something

349
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,760
there, you have to believe in it and you

350
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:19,600
just have to have the resilience and the

351
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,279
grit to to keep bringing it every day.

352
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
That's the hard thing about being an

353
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
entrepreneur. You've got to dig deep

354
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,279
when no one else believes and you have

355
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,120
to believe. Not only do you have to

356
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,120
believe, but you have to make sure that

357
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,639
your team believes. That would be my

358
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639
advice. You just you can't give

359
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,680
up. I was worried that after a year

360
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,720
maybe I didn't know what that next thing

361
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,320
was going to be. I felt I have to make

362
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,959
the best use of this time. So, did you

363
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,199
make the best use of that time? I think

364
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,920
I made the best use of the time there. I

365
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,959
mean, the fact that I was able to start

366
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,800
Lucid Link and it's become such a an

367
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,079
important part of my life and an

368
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,000
important part of almost 200 people who

369
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,079
work for the company. It was absolutely

370
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,800
worth it. I think u I I can't imagine a

371
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,320
better outcome for me personally. How do

372
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,560
I think about uh the ability to nurture

373
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,440
instinct to challenge yourself or just

374
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,120
to put yourself in challenging

375
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,600
situations? I think this is something

376
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,360
you can nurture. People talk about

377
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,240
growth all the time. They say, "Oh, this

378
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,959
is amazing. We get this chance to grow."

379
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,120
Growth is hard. Growth is painful.

380
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,320
Growth kind of sucks sometimes. The

381
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,959
result of growth is awesome. The process

382
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,440
of growth kind of sucks. It's hard. How

383
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,800
you can do that? It's through habits.

384
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,560
It's through not taking those shortcuts.

385
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,360
It's through recognizing when you have a

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,680
a decision in front of you and doing

387
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,759
something that is right, not necessarily

388
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,519
easy. The more you do those, and those

389
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,360
can be small things. They can be small

390
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
things like waking up and being like,

391
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,439
"Yeah, I don't know. I don't have to go

392
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,120
to the gym." Or go to the gym and say,

393
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,240
you know, I'll just do one one set

394
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,640
instead of three. every time and no

395
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,839
matter how small or big those decisions

396
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,120
are that you take not the easy path but

397
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,000
the right path you're going to gradually

398
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,440
build that habit within yourself. You'll

399
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
build that muscle uh to be open to

400
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,180
challenging yourself. How you do one

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:18:08,119
thing is how you do everything.
