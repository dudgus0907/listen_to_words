207
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,240
phase in eighth grade where I tried to

208
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,200
wear suspenders to school every day you

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,640
guys remember that oh of course I had

210
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,279
them in every color I was clipping them

211
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,839
under your back every day oh I love

212
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,880
suspenders I never wore them to school

213
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,040
yes you did I think I wore purple ones

214
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:25,079
once Chris a Florida man trying to do

215
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,079
his best tan impression when

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,360

217
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
oh it's his legs it's his legs Nick it's

218
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,480
his

219
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,519
[ __ ] when the branch he was on

220
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,200
collapsed see it's his leg his leg is

221
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,079
broken oh my God you can see his broken

222
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,120
leg broken leg no you can't see no his

223
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:52,120
leg's not broken I think it's just

224
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,480
inertia when the branch he was on

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,320
collapsed well get me his GoPro footage

226
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,320
he has a go

227
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,480
strapped to his chest oh get me that

228
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,959
footage get me that footage um if you

229
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,519
listen closely you can also hear that

230
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,920
his goal was to get into the water

231
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,079
anyway yes he took the route I don't

232
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,760
think he had planned but it's like you

233
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,279
were up there you intended to get the

234
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,000
ground you did want to jum doesn't shock

235
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,800
me this happened last month the man says

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
he usually jumps from another branch and

237
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,440
this was the first time he went that

238
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,200
high I shouldn't have tested this branch

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,160
out slit my mind maybe I shouldn't climb

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,920
60 ft in the [ __ ] air did he did he

241
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,839
do the wait I need to hear her

242
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,519
question I don't think he ever got it

243
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,279
out he started and then then it turned

244
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,440
into cut off turned into a different

245
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,760
call and I have a feeling he'll see I

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,760
can make fun of him cuz I'm a viewer

247
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,639
