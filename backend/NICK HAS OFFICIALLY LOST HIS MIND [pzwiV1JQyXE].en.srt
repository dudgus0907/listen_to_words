24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,320
take to knock you down that's it what I

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,120
was going to say is people are so quick

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,320
to judge others and everyone will call

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,960
you stop it people are so quick to judge

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,439
others and they're so quick to judge in

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,320
general when I think if you're going to

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,320
judge others and be a total dick bag

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,799
loser why don't you walk to the closest

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,960
[ __ ] mirror in your house which is

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
probably not many since you probably

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,439
hate seeing yourself and you look in

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,560
there can you stop and you judge

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,920
yourself if you're going to sit and

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,520
you're going to judge other people how

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,720
about you take a good long look in the

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,040
mirror and tell me if you like what you

40
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,320
see

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
cuz I know when I see a mirror I don't

42
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,960
hate what I see at all because I'm not a

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,360
judgmental horrible person I really

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,200
think that that you live by the Golden

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,079
Rule and that is treat others how you

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,880
want to be treated I do I'm a really

47
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,799
like as much as I say things that are

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,759
just crazy I am a very I do I definitely

49
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,520
do I definitely live by the gold my

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,079
whole thing I'm genuinely there's not

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,439
one person that I've met that would say

52
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,240
I'm a bad person

53
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,719
unless they're unless they're a [ __ ]

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,240
idiot sure which is a few maybe like

55
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,759
three there probably three people who

56
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,720
don't like like me at all okay and that

57
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,720
is because they are wrong uh I could get

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,560
the double digits no that don't like me

59
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,959
name

60
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,239
them [ __ ] idiot

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,120
obnoxious

62
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,760
who would never say that she would never

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,680
say really you don't think so never say

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,680
that okay um

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
was a loser and if that's eight people

66
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,480
who don't like me and I've been alive

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,760
for 21 years that's not that many if

68
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,239
you're honest and true to yourself

69
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,440
you're destined to have someone not like

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,200
you and that's a fact that's what I I'd

71
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,239
rather have hundreds of people not like

72
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,640
me for being Who I Am A Friend Of All is

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,720
a friend to none correct I'd rather have

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,680
many people dislike me for being who I

75
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,560
am rather than try and fit the mold you

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,599
guys try and box me into who's you guys

77
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,120
them who's them they know okay that's

78
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,519
good you guys are going to make make fun

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,840
of me when I say this probably it is so

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,080
unbelievable to me how dependent we are

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,040
on water as people and it's also so

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,400
crazy how like water is genuinely

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,799
magic you may say you're so [ __ ] you

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,599
are ridiculous and you have lost your

85
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,920
mind but when you think of it on a

86
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,720
deeper level if you did not have water

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,799
you would die so in the grand scheme of

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,439
things water if you don't have water

89
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,200
you'll die so in the grand scheme of

90
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,080
things as human beings who drink water

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,879
who need it to live we're essentially

92
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,959
like drinking our youth euthanized

93
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,720
euthanizing youth youth bringing serum

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,439
Elixir like water AR water doesn't make

95
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,400
you young it just keeps you why aren't

96
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,239
we but it's like an Elixir it's

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
literally it's literally like a magical

98
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,319
Elixir and it's why we are all still

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,480
here today and that's if it's crazy to

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
think that when I go to the to the

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,079
airport when I go to Disneyland when I

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
go to super public settings I can look

103
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,560
around and guarantee you these people

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
are all drinking water I can go anywhere

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,040
and almost guarantee someone here has

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,720
had water today for sure and it's like

107
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,640
it's so crazy almost every single person

108
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,480
you ask unless they're crazy asking

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,040
people for youth serum instead if we go

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,759
to a restaurant what do you guys want to

111
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,400
I'll just take some youth serum you or

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,840

113
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,919

183
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,400
wait wait wait why was there a giant

184
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,560
vast of molasses in Boston the Molasses

185
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Factory I assume but like why was it so

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
high up that it was like pouring

187
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,360
out no more question syrup and molasses

188
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,039
can differ in their production taste

189
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,159
texture and nutritional content so

190
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,120
everything they're different I want

191
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,000
molasses I want to give it a shot syrup

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,560
and I think it can be compared similarly

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
to

194
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,879
honey the poo I hate the [ __ ] bees

developed this

276
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:52,079
recently when people lose their [ __ ]

277
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,399
mind that someone is leaving the theater

278
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:59,600

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,600

283
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,760
newest biggest pet peeve is when people

285
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,199
that the giraffe cover the elep when

286
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,680
people I hate when people post on Tik

287
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,600
Tok like videos of people like leaving

288
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,320
the movie theater before the end credits

289
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
and they were like they're clearly not a

290
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,720
true fan or I was raised by Mar so I

299
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,279

00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:21,240
have the [ __ ] 20 second person to

361
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,000
touch a light for scene number 745 every

362
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,040
[ __ ] goddamn person is credited who's

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,120
ever touched a film ever and then we get

364
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,680
to see the goofy little 20 second

365
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,160
monologue at the end thank you my pride

366
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,160
and joy I'm so happy I sat on my [ __ ]

367
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,920
thumb in this theater and waited for an

368
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,920
extra five goddamn minutes to experience

369
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,839
the same thing I would have already

370
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,959
before you're crazy I

371
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,639
think I

372
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,839
agree this helps me a lot deal with the

373
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,360
actual issues in my life freaking out

374
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,160
about literally nothing you're crazy so

375
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,839
cuz I no hold on that's the most passion

376
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
you've talked about any

377
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,279
I just had so much to say my favorite

378
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,240
thing about Nick is he'll do that he'll

379
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,000
do that right and that's been what five

380
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,240
six minutes at the end of the day he

381
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,759
doesn't really care I don't at all he

382
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
doesn't cuz that just walk out anyway I

383
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,800
don't care if you're like and you want

384
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,440
the fun the even funnier part about

385
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,199
it sometimes you stay for the end credit

386
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
scene I do you know what I mean like

387
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,800
yeah like that's why we can't take what

388
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,560
I say too seriously here cuz I'm not

389
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,399
only a hypocrite but I'm careless and I

390
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,440
don't actually give a [ __ ] about what I

391
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,920
just went on a five minute Rampage about

392
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,040

393
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,680
you Nick yeah let's see if there's

394
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,279
anything else I want to talk about oh

395
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,079

396
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,880

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,440

this world that are allowing their kids

407
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,799
to go on Tik Tock but not Instagram

408
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,280
Instagram to me is like a social app

409
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,319
where you can chit and chat and see fun

410
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,919
photos of people you know in real life

411
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,559

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,080
celebrities that like you just want to

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
see some funny content from and there's

414
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,880
not really something bad on Instagram

415
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,360
true Tik Tok is an abyss of hate and

416
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,080
vile

417
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,440
Behavior why do you have Tik Tok and not

418
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,440

00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,360
to a hotel you could get off the

541
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,559
elevator like the second floor and then

542
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,880
go up to the third floor and it looks

543
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,440

601
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,799
want Nick to enter through it every time

603
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,440
really good thing that's a good that's a

604
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,799
good liability if you think for a split

605
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,200
second more than someone some else

606
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,399

607
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,279

608
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:37,080
Gary no that's how I feel that's how I

609
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:41,039
feel app that's why I never like I go to

610
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,880
bed and I struggle to stop thinking same

611
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,799
because I'm too busy so would you say

612
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,640
yes you are the Thinker I think I'm the

613
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,840
Thinker I just think I I I just walk

614
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,600
into I walk into a room and I I say I'm

615
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,600
outthinking everyone in here I I never

616
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,080
think about that I um I I have to

617
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,520
confess this for a very long time I've

618
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,760
been confused about the difference

619
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,120
between Chicken Little and Stewart

620
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,640
Little and one is a chicken and one is a

621
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,360
rat and they're both little there's no

622
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,919
they are not the same and I've just

623
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,880
figured this out cuz Stuart Little has

624
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,480
those big ugly red [ __ ] shoes

625
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,640
on and Chicken Little got that crazy

626
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,640
looking friend that girl but what's the

627
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,600
point of both of those I need to I need

628
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,279

629
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,919

632
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,679
Little are long lost Brothers oh and

633
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,840
they are both little and they need to

634
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,840
find each other to stop the sky from

635
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,200

636
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,399

637
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,039

640
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,960
