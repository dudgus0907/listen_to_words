1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
belus is a totalitarian state I wanted

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,919
to be free the guy worked in it advised

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,480
me if you get that job you will be free

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,360
you can get out of belus you won't be

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,920
dependent on rules of the country where

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,839
your parents are where your relatives

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,240
are and and you were looking to get free

8
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,039
so that worked totally work everything

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,760
is working out I'm so happy in my life

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,359
but that changed dramatically with

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,240
Revolution B we had a raid in our office

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,720
government took four people hostage how

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,199
did I navigate that so you recently

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,520
crossed 100 million of AR how did that

15
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,559
feel when you notice that actually

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,079
happening there's a brand value of the

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,480
100 million brand value of becoming a

starting padon it wasn't even called

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
pandadoc in the beginning when was it

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,400
what were your observations why did you

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,479
decide to start the company pandadoc is

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,240
a step function of web design business

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,479
I've run Landing in America some thing

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,640
like oh my God it's been such a long

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,960
time 22 years ago it started as very

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,040
simple tool to address an internal need

43
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,600
transformed into something bigger as we

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,759
learned along the way so let's just

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,600
start with the very early days actually

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,000
even before the 22-year Journey of panda

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,280
do you're from Eastern Europe where were

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,320
you born what was your upbringing like I

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
was born and raised in bellarus which is

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,399
a small country between Poland and

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,880
Russia I always wanted to have an

52
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:04,520
opportunity to using my passion energy

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,439
to try to build something Belarus is a

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,759
totalitarian state I want it to be free

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,560
I wanted to be able to unleash my energy

56
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:17,280
maybe my creativity at the age of 19 I

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,640
got an opportunity to enroll into a

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,040
student Exchange program and I came to

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,200
us to flip burgers at Han airport that

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,239
was the first place where I landed to do

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,239
variety of random jobs I also learned to

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
design and build website that was my

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,280
first small business in America that

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,519
small business helped to pay for college

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,879
here in the US it also funded with later

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,879
became our first software service

67
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,280
company and then kedu wow so much unpack

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,640
there you said you wanted to be free was

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,159
that something that was unique in your

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
yearning that even your friends or your

71
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,720
families notice where they were like H

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,159
Makita is a little different than most

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,280
people in bellarus or was that a common

74
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,040
sentiment in your community I think most

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,319
teenagers just want to be free so

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,879
therefore it's not unique maybe what was

77
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,159
unique and different is timeline of

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,080
circumstances that happen in my life the

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,120
people that I met along the way that

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,440
helped me to believe that sort of the

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,239
sky is the limit anything is possible so

82
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,760
I wouldn't say there's something way

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,519
different in my character there are

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,360
likely certain things that help me to

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,959
make the move give me that energy give

86
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,239
me that to leave at anything's possible

87
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,799
but there's also a lot of luck and a lot

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,400
of circumstances LED my path the way it

89
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,040
yeah were some of those examples let's

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,439
say when I was 15 years old for a long

91
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,439
time I've been I've been getting really

92
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:42,120
sick and my mom decided to send me to

93
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,480
Crimea so that I can get exposed to the

94
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Sun and hopefully not be sick anymore a

95
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,200
guy who was her colleague he was an

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,599
intern at the place where she worked was

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,040
actually going to Crimea she asked

98
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,400
whether I can tag along the guy worked

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,000
in it it was his first job he was an

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,680
intern he over the course of the month

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,480
being there in Crimea became my role

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,920
model I loved computers my entire

103
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,560
childhood he pursued me to learn to

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,120
coach try to become software engineer

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,439
the pitch that worked with me at the

106
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,480
time was like if you get that job you

107
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,160
will be free you can go anywhere and

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,919
you'll be in demand and you can get a

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
job anywhere in the world you can get

110
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,000
out of bellus you won't be dependent on

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,199
rules of the country who your parents

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,639
are or who your relatives are and and

113
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,600
you were looking to get free I was

114
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,400
looking to get free so that worked that

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,160
totally worked how old was this person

116
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,240
he was 19 at that time maybe 20 at that

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,880
time something like that I was 15

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,880
turning 16 we went to Crimea did you

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,919
live together with them yes we were

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,039
roommates most importantly like I've

121
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,680
seen a role model who was just like a

122
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,240
few years ahead of me was already able

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,039
to pay his own bills and travel and be

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,199
free that's what I was looking for so

125
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,560
that was one Turning Point yeah why was

126
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,280
he going there oh just to have a good

127
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,560
time vacation vacation for it was was

128
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,120
total happen stance yeah then I think

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,360
the next Turning Point point when I got

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,800
a US Visa and was able to come here for

131
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,199
summer it was a mind-blowing experience

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,199
which is a wonderful program that

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,720
allowed a lot of Eastern European kids

134
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,199
to come to America work for summer and

135
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,680
see what America is all about maybe some

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,280
of the propaganda I've seen on like

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
belus and TV it just has shown a

138
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,600
different side of America not Hollywood

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,400
but hardworking and Earnest down to

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,840
earth the side of it that I really

141
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,240
really liked do you remember how you

142
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,680
heard of the program

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,840
yes it was a big deal in Belarus like

144
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,720
all friends of my friends who I thought

145
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,560
are really cool they all either wanted

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,440
to get into the program or have gone

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,759
through the program but yeah a lot of

148
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,520
kids participated a lot of people went

149
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,400
to us so yeah I've seen how big America

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,280
is compared to Belarus how much

151
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,039
opportunity is here the second pivotal

152
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,639
meeting at the time for me was meeting

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,080
my first landlord in America this

154
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,240
Japanese guy he rented his house to

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,759
exchange two three students per room we

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,600
were all cramped in that place but it

157
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,240
was wonderful time 14 16 hours a day but

158
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,840
somehow we also found time to see the US

159
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,120
the place where we work and have a good

160
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,199
time he was the first guy who said look

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,400
if you somehow stay in this country you

162
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,599
will be very successful you will become

163
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,319
a millionaire at the time it all felt

164
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,520
like a bit of a BS cuz I was flipping

165
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,520
burgers and cleaning toilets and I was

166
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,720
making

167
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,639
$725 an hour his whole rationale was

168
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,560
like as long as you work hard as hard as

169
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,680
you do you will be successful in this

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,479
country he just kept repeating and

171
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,360
repeating and repeating and at some

172
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,479
point I started believing it I think

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,720
that was the second the second kind of

174
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,160
big pivot and he was saying this to

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,880
everybody or just to you in a side

176
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,319
conversation to all the exchange

177
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,919
students that did work H 14 16 hours a

178
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,000
day got it so he saw something in some

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,000
of the folks there who are like working

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,039
really hard maybe he was able to relate

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,759
you grow up on a farm he worked really

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
hard growing up maybe there was

183
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,440
something else but yeah there were a few

184
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,440
folks whom he kept repeating this to who

185
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,759
he helped I remember there were many

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,080
many times when he had someone got sick

187
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,599
he took us to a pharmacy or he drove us

188
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,240
to work but he was helping here and

189
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,599
there and yeah that was the only support

190
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,800
system we had coming here so that was

191
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,720
for a full summer yeah that was the

192
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,639
first summer and then the second summer

193
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,879
I came with a goal to transition from an

194
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,520
exchange student to a student through

195
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,000
the summer I made me enough money to pay

196
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,280
for a community college it was $3,500

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,479
and I stayed I went to school onah in

198
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,400
Hawaii okay so this is back in Hawaii I

199
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,560
was back in Hawaii I studied for about a

200
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,240
year I learned to actually speak English

201
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,360
versus just read and then I started

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,639
building website I connected with a few

203
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,680
of my former classmates from Belarus we

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,759
built little software products we put

205
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,919
them online and people started buying

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,599
those little things at that point I

207
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,639
thought okay we buil five or 10 of them

208
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,759
what if we build hundreds of them I pack

209
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,240
my things move back to bellus so you go

210
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,960
back to belus you have this initial idea

211
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,840
that was kind of like a side project but

212
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,599
it was working do you remember like how

213
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,800
many sales you made or how many products

214
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,479
you had like what was the scale of that

215
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,360
quote unquote business that gave you the

216
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,000
light bubb of oh this could maybe work

217
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
it's a very small business the first

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,280
little Adon we built that was back in

219
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,120
Hawaii cost was 10 bucks $9.99 to be per

220
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,279
genius marketers we sold d thousands of

221
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,279
copies of this thing but the peculiar

222
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,839
thing for us at the time was that we

223
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:40,000
didn't have to do anything for this

224
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,000
thing to sell and generate Revenue prior

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,680
to that I built websites it was a

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
service I was paid on an hourly basis

227
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,360
therefore in order to earn money I had

228
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,720
to put in the time now we built

229
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,360
something and it just sold it crazy was

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,640
unbelievable yeah today we live in this

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,880
app economy software economy this is not

232
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,600
a novice type of thing but for a kid

233
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,399
from bellarus that doesn't really know

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,000
much about business that was a

235
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,160
mindblowing expl we sold thousands of

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,399
those copies of the software then we

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,519
built another thing and another thing

238
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,680
that was like okay I'm getting a passive

239
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,160
income of $5,000 a month maybe $10,000 a

240
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,279
month that was more than enough to fly

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,040
back to belus rante a studio sleep in

242
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,160
that studio and wake up make my bed and

243
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,920
then transform it into an office which

244
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,399
was frequented by my former thean

245
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,760
classmate who we partnered with to build

246
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,200
more of those little software pieces

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,440
little addons we were employing some

248
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,399
like 35 people and the business was

249
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,079
generating

250
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,640
$700,000 per year which again is not

251
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,760
much for the us but it was a lot of

252
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,360
money back Ben in Belarus why I decide

253
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,160
to go back to belus to do this rather

254
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,240
than stay in Oahu talent I would be able

255
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,160
to hire engineers in us to do this for

256
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
like $220,000 a year those is too

257
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,440
expensive so you rationally thought it

258
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
was better to go back to bellarus did

259
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
you have any like personal reasons that

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,680
you wanted to go back to your home

261
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,519
country at that time primary reason was

262
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,880
I didn't see a path towards building a

263
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,880
software business I had no idea how the

264
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,200
like this whole Adventure ecosystem

265
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,160
operates and works I didn't know Venture

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,519
funds exist so in order to build a

267
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,279
software company that sell

268
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,160
online which is amazing yeah I thought I

269
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,480
have to go back try to hire my friends

270
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,040
that's what I did wow what was the best

271
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,600
selling or the most used app in that

272
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,399
initial software like what was the

273
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
actual software supposed to do I can

274
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,000
tell you what the first thing did yeah

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,920
was the first one it was an extension

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,560
for webcon management system exported

277
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,440
data what I mean by webcon management

278
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,120
system imagine something that sits

279
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,320
behind a website and then updates

280
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,279
content y y they just didn't build

281
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,120
something that was needed by a lot of

282
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,000
other web designers or user we created a

283
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,279
little extension little adult it

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,160
exported data into CSV format the idea

285
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,240
was on the surface it was not something

286
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,079
incredibly smart kind of like Plumbing

287
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,680
with that CMS system then we created a

288
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,079
bunch of like designs for it so that you

289
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,240
can install a new design into your

290
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,320
website then we created a bunch of

291
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,079
little addons that integrate things like

292
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,360
Twitter that just came out or Facebook

293
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,839
that at the time just came out and yada

294
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,880
y yada we didn't really have an

295
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,920
overnight success or like brilliant idea

296
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,399
little software product that got us rich

297
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,480
fast everything was like a little step

298
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,120
function little stair so there's not

299
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,880
much to Brock about you know it's just

300
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,639
big boring business so you're back in

301
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,240
bellarus 700k Revenue per year 35 people

302
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,959
life is pretty good oh yeah life was

303
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,839
wonderful and what year was this we

304
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,399
started this business in 2007 we

305
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,399
operated it for 3 and A2 years so that's

306
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
through the financial crisis anything

307
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,360
that happened there we service very low

308
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
end of the market with very cheap

309
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,399
product although we did have Microsoft

310
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
as a client wow we got lucky with tell

311
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,680
us about that somebody within Microsoft

312
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,440
bought one of those little extensions

313
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,040
wanted a customization they came to us I

314
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,079
tried my best to present ourselves

315
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,680
something bigger that we really were we

316
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,079
were a 15 people two-bedroom apartment

317
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,839
turned into an office that's what it was

318
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,240
if they knew that they' never do any

319
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,839
business with us yeah we powered part of

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,199
microsoft.com did they also pay $9.99 a

321
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,360
month we build them maybe

322
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:33,480
$10,000 wow so 2010 you have Microsoft

323
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,800
as a client 700k 35 people and then what

324
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,680
happened whenever vendors of that con

325
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,800
management system that would built for

326
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,720
changed something without thinking

327
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,959
things through our software broke our

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,120
extensions broke clients thought it's

329
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,839
our fault so we were getting PS in the

330
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,399
middle of the night whenever that

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,639
happened that just started to become at

332
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,240
least once in a couple of months we had

333
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,639
that search we had to wake up try to fix

334
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,240
things at the time there was a Blog by

335
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,800
one of the pioneers of software as a

336
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,519
service company called 37 signals which

337
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,800
built software that was Standalone and

338
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,600
had a credit card swipe form and my

339
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,199
co-founder was like oh my God it would

340
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,440
be so wonderful not to be dependent on

341
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:19,000
anyone just be dependent on ourselves so

342
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,959
that whenever our stuff goes down it's

343
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,519
on US versus it's because of someone

344
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,839
else that never happened because you

345
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,000
know we're hosting AWS now and at the

346
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,959
time that was a good enough idea and we

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,399
wanted to build tool pool where user can

348
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,000
swipe their credit card use software

349
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,160
online and we get paid that sounded like

350
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,680
a dream again we had no idea that

351
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,839
software as a service is going to

352
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,120
explode we didn't think we're going to

353
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,800
be able to raise money at any point in

354
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,079
the future we had no idea we're going to

355
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,959
this little thing is going to progress

356
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,440
into padoc is today but we decided to

357
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,240
pursue that path of Independence we got

358
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,240
really really lucky so there's this

359
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,480
existing business though so how did did

360
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,279
you balance this new initiative with was

361
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,959
already generating oh poor we hired a

362
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,040
CEO who's a former client from a highly

363
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,199
profitable business within a year became

364
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,519
a highly unprofitable with a lot of

365
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,160
internal turmoil and conflict at some

366
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
point we were bleeding cast this first

367
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,839
business and then we were bleeding cash

368
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,480
in what later became pad do it was a

369
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,680
really stressful time the original team

370
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,320
in this first business which consisted

371
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,040
of our friends former classmates like

372
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,360
folks that we were in trenches with they

373
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,800
were Fed Up the new management our

374
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,680
decision to kind of step aside and start

375
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,839
this new thing they put an ultimatum in

376
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,759
front of us saying like look if you guys

377
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
are going to keep the new management

378
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,959
you're not going to fix this thing we're

379
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,120
out when a company is like 35 employees

380
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,160
and your core team like five seven

381
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,920
people exits then the company's done we

382
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,959
ask like okayy do you know how to fix it

383
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,160
they said yes we do we asked whether

384
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,680
they want to run it they said yes we do

385
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,560
we asked whether they want to buy it

386
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,199
they said we have money to buy it and we

387
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,880
asked what if you were to make that

388
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:05,639
money over the course of next however

389
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,440
many years we settled on a price of

390
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,240
$40,000 for that business wow which is

391
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,600
not much but it was bleeding cash and

392
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,000
those were our friends and they turned

393
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,079
it around and turned this company into

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,800
successful operation with at this point

395
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,480
more than 100 employees so it's still

396
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,199
going it's still going yeah it has a

397
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,360
different name but it is still going

398
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,720
this like founding team who we worked

399
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,800
with at the time has done really well

400
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,880
for themselves we're still friends yeah

401
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,600
the story had a happy ending so you

402
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,600
decide to start P roller effectively

403
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,959
sold or hand it off the original

404
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,079
business to your other colleague tell us

405
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,160
about origin of that idea like what did

406
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,199
you see in the market why that specific

407
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,519
problem we had a few ideas running

408
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,279
actually in parallel me and my

409
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,480
co-founder and I got to mention you

410
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,720
asked me what were the pivotal Moment In

411
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,600
the Journey I think pivotal moment was

412
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,639
actually starting to work with my

413
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,279
co-founder we are very different people

414
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,839
but I got really lucky meeting this guy

415
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,120
we met back in University in bellarus

416
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,040
played in the same band he was a drummer

417
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,160
I was base over the Journey of going to

418
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,399
us and coming down he was brightest of

419
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,800
all my friends not just one of those

420
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,160
very smart Engineers but also a very

421
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,600
empathetic person very down to earth and

422
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,399
very leveled very balanced the third

423
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,800
pivotal moment was actually meeting him

424
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,160
and persuading him to go into business

425
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,040
with me he had a great career at a large

426
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,360
company I was able to convince him to to

427
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,319
go into starting a company with me so he

428
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,000
wasn't involved in the first he was oh

429
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,279
he was he started the first company oh

430
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,680
okay so he was already involved he was

431
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:43,519
part of the 35 yeah the two of you took

432
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
the lead of hey we got to try this new

433
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,680
thing we were looking at a bunch of

434
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,639
different ideas some of the ideas were

435
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,600
my ideas some of the ideas were his

436
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,440
ideas there were a few things we were

437
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
trying to like tickle with quot troller

438
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,279
which later became Panda do was among

439
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,360
all probably the most feasible to

440
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,199
execute it just made them all sense I'm

441
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,199
on everything we we Tred to pursue we

442
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,319
tried to build Airbnb for Eastern Europe

443
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,400
Airbnb I want to say it was at the time

444
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,559
was launching here okay it was a really

445
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,559
tough business we tried to build a

446
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,199
scheduling system for small businesses

447
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,160
like brick and mortar businesses it was

448
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,160
a good business but Michaela didn't like

449
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,439
the code base there and he just trashed

450
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,360
it was trying to do a project management

451
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,160
system and I trashed that one because at

452
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,280
the time there were just too many other

453
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,919
options felt it's a red ocean type of

454
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,919
market and we shouldn't do that and then

455
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,880
there was a summer I had to go to the US

456
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,320
he had to stay in bellus and and hold a

457
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,679
fortress D got him into sales because he

458
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,039
needed to build sales proposals and he

459
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,679
hated how much time that process take

460
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,760
originally qu troller was his idea and

461
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,960
later I translated into pandadoc we

462
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,039
expanded it Beyond sales proposals into

463
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,080
all kinds of standard bureaucratic

464
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,240
document that we can automate that idea

465
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,679
kind of just kept at it what was the

466
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,760
existing process that he and most people

467
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
in this field took take a Boer plate

468
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,799
agreement copy paste back and forth

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,760
forever and then send it out never

470
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,880
knowing whether it gets open the

471
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,720
recipient really cares and really spends

472
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,840
time on that on that document that was

473
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,919
the process that preceded creation of

474
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,000
quad roller and some of the pains that

475
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,039
we experienced in that sales process we

476
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Tred to Sol so it was really built for

477
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,760
his own use case and then there must

478
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
have been a moment where you and he were

479
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,600
like we should productize this or sell

480
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,039
this to others we were looking for

481
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,919
something to productize from the get

482
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,559
therefore we've been sort of looking

483
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,840
inwards at problems that existed in our

484
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,080
business at the time this was one of the

485
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,960
problems and we were building it as a

486
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,039
product and The Way We Were building it

487
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,799
is it's the wrong way to do things we

488
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,400
know everything we're going to build it

489
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,039
they're going to come and they'll pay us

490
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,799
a lot of money that was wrong we we

491
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:55,760
spend countless hours arguing about the

492
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:58,280
colors of the buttons or the where this

493
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,840
tab goes or whatever some nonsense I

494
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,200
remember spending all of our money

495
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,799
draining all of our savings to launch

496
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,480
this thing then see how people that come

497
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,600
to the appication end up paying that was

498
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,919
Soul wrecking but it helped us to learn

499
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,679
that we know nothing about like the the

500
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,240
market the problem the pain points have

501
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,760
to check our egos go talk to the market

502
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
go talk to customers tell them their

503
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,520
ideas and their pains and then their

504
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,000
thoughts I think that first failure was

505
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,280
in this particular product was very

506
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,039
impactful very helpful towards building

507
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,000
the the bigger Vision way it was set up

508
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,080
was similar to your prior version where

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,840
people could just come in sign up

510
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
download get access to it and just start

511
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,360
using with the credit cards it was first

512
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,919
just a free tool and we thought okay the

513
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,679
moment we're going to attach billing to

514
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,320
it people are going to pay us that was

515
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,159
not the case we had okay some like 3,000

516
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,240
premium users only six ended up paying

517
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,440
some like 9 or 18 bucks a month which

518
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,159
considering the money we spent to build

519
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,039
this thing was was nothing how are they

520
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,120
even finding out about this though like

521
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,039
the 3000 do you remember how they even

522
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,919
came myod of different techniques that

523
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,960
were the result of the natural anxiety I

524
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,559
had at the time

525
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,360
Su I was in a constant fear and I was

526
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,960
trying to run different experiments and

527
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,039
get the word out there was this uh

528
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,640
targeted to the Bellis Community or was

529
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,280
it Global from day one it was Global

530
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,799
from the day one in fact we were

531
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,200
building a tool for sales proposals it

532
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,440
wasn't applicable to belus Market in any

533
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,840
way we didn't build it in native

534
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,600
language it was English from the day w

535
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,559
got it and so no real funding yet right

536
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,679
you were self-funding it at that point I

537
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,360
didn't know that funding that it exists

538
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,360
I only later learned that it exists

539
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,760
weend kind of a Meetup that we randomly

540
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,080
read about online and we decided to show

541
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,440
up oh where was it it was in bellarus it

542
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,240
was in men I remember that a bunch of

543
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,679
people told us that what we're working

544
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:02,000
on is DS um but there were people called

545
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,039
investors at this thing and I was like

546
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,280
oh wow that's how things could work but

547
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,760
it's been at least a year between that

548
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,279
and our first financing when was that

549
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,640
our first financing happened 11 and 1/2

550
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:16,760
years ago do you remember the moment you

551
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,919
decided that you should raise I presume

552
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,440
there was some inklings of the idea from

553
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,360
meetups like that but then from a

554
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,559
business standpoint you probably wanted

555
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,200
to get to a certain point before tapping

556
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,440
that opportunity we needed the money we

557
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
on a Ramen diet for sure I've been

558
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,279
trying to fundraise for at least a year

559
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,880
we're talking like hundreds of

560
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:40,600
conversations hundreds of leads hundreds

561
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,120
of investors dozens of trips to here or

562
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,960
there because B doesn't have any Venture

563
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,960
scene it all kind of came together I had

564
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,600
a baby on the way I really wanted my

565
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,679
daughter to have a passport of a free

566
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,400
country so I really wanted to make a

567
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,760
move here I really wanted to be able to

568
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,080
start learning the Bay Area and growing

569
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,480
the business here the business was on a

570
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,360
CP to hit break even so all of this

571
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,960
happened sort of at the same time but

572
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,960
first I made a move I had to sell

573
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,279
everything in valo so that the baby can

574
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,799
be born here it was very stressful like

575
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,840
short period of time but there was a

576
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,320
happy ending eight investors chipped in

577
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,760
a little bit which amounted to

578
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,080
$650,000 which at the time I thought

579
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,799
they're crazy you can't even touch it

580
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,679
some piece of software a bunch of kids

581
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,120
in a third world country put together

582
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,960
it's somewhere out there in the cloud it

583
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,120
can break it can be hacked so many

584
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,720
things can go wrong why would they do

585
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,480
this I didn't misrepresent anything but

586
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,279
you tell some facts but then in the back

587
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,240
of your mind my mind was still not

588
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,320
really exposed to everything that's

589
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,320
possible the world of software in

590
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,000
Silicon Valley I was still a belarusan

591
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,240
kid that didn't know much so 650k do you

592
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,840
remember the pre-money post money I do

593
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,120
remember the post money what was it

594
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,000
valuation cap it was 3 and half million

595
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,320
do you remember how big the company was

596
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,559
at that time both from a p&l financial

597
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,039
standpoint as well as Personnel wise we

598
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,799
were making 20 grand a month we were

599
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,799
growing fast and we were a team of I

600
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,799
want to say 10 people at the time maybe

601
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,240
seven people at the time but definitely

602
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,600
less than 20 got it all in bellus still

603
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,559
somewhere outside of barus those were

604
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,960
remote contractor types that were with

605
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,200
the company so it seems like you already

606
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,559
knew that you wanted to build a global

607
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,679
company building business in bellus is

608
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,799
is I don't think it's feasible in the

609
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,200
software or Hightech sphere B is kind of

610
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,600
like Estonia or Israel internal Market

611
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,400
is Tiny there's so much bureaucracy and

612
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,400
so much corruption there was a lot of

613
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,960
talent but there's not much Market

614
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,799
therefore if you want to build a

615
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,840
software business you have to do

616
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,799
something globally so you had that and

617
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,919
then from a employee standpoint there

618
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,200
was some concentration in belus but you

619
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,200
already employing people from outside

620
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,400
how did you manage that because that's a

621
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,159
very intentional decision to have a

622
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,720
remote Workforce even at that stage of a

623
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,279
company well we didn't have money to

624
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,640
rent an office didn't have a know how to

625
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,480
run a payroll again didn't have money

626
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:16,039
and brand to recruit very tough Talent

627
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,960
so we had to be hacky and figure out how

628
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:21,919
do we find good people that for whatever

629
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,559
reason ended up being in place where

630
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,360
can't get a full-time job at a great

631
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,480
software company employing full-time and

632
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,240
we found them wow so you moved to San

633
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,640
Francisco where's your co-founder at

634
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,919
this time belus so he stayed yeah is he

635
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,720
still there he moved 2 years after me

636
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,640
okay so he followed suit so you both

637
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,440
come to San Francisco and then share

638
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,399
with us the journey from there so what

639
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,559
is the quote roller journey and then

640
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:50,279
when does the panda do name come into

641
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,760
play started our first office was

642
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,360
townhouse I rent it in s Francisco okay

643
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,000
pretty much the same as like the way we

644
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,720
started our affer business in bellaro

645
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,520
during the night that's where we flap

646
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,000
during the day that was where we worked

647
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,120
our first sales guy was trying to pursue

648
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,679
customers that that called in that it's

649
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,919
not the baby crying on the background

650
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,080
it's something oh cuz you had a baby

651
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,799
yeah it that was the case the baby was

652
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,360
crying in the background and then we

653
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,440
were sitting in the living room trying

654
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,200
to be the m h or write some code then

655
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,520
that progressed into a small office in

656
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,039
the middle of nowhere then it progressed

657
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,600
into a small office San Francisco one of

658
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,679
those live work Apartments townhouse

659
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,279
then that progressed to a tiny office on

660
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,240
cnie Street then AG Gro so you're

661
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,080
starting to have some center of gravity

662
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,760
in San Francisco was that intentional

663
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,799
you were hiring here and you have a

664
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,320
separate team in bellus and you wanted

665
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,279
this to be the center I read a lot of

666
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,840
dech crunch and um they said that's

667
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,600
where software companies in

668
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,880
retrospective I think that was another

669
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:59,559
good decision because it put me into

670
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,440
environment where I was able to learn so

671
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:05,840
much so quickly from so many people that

672
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,480
had experience that I didn't have or had

673
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,000
a Kno how that never exposed to it was

674
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,000
so much easier to surround myself with

675
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,919
people smarter than I am here in the Bay

676
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,640
Area compared to Belarus I stayed here

677
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,399
however we kept hiring people all around

678
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,919
the United States we had American living

679
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:26,960
in Europe who worked for us we try to

680
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,320
scramble and figure out all kinds of

681
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,320
like hacky Solutions towards Talent as

682
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,640
you're scaling you have a global team

683
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,440
and you've had some very interesting and

684
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,200
tricky situations to navigate Wars are

685
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,480
involved tell us about some of those big

686
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,840
struggles or challenges that you faced

687
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,840
over the years I think the first

688
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,840
struggle is what is I'm supposed to do

689
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,360
in my role it was rough trying to hire

690
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,120
people here in America it was rough

691
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,919
trying to lead people I made so many

692
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,039
mistakes if I was to go back I would do

693
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,679
a lot of things differently what is one

694
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,799
thing you would do differently the

695
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:05,080
biggest mistake you probably made I

696
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,600
micromanaged so many times yeah you know

697
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,240
what I'd leave you with this too um I

698
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,480
think lack of patience is a lot of

699
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,520
mistakes a lot of challenges came from

700
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,120
maybe at times some Bor headedness I

701
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,799
know like how to do better Clos mindness

702
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,480
there's a lot I got to learn and I have

703
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,320
to learn while doing while keeping an

704
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,080
open mind that helped quite a bit there

705
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,440
are some challenges outside of our

706
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,000
domain our control there was covid which

707
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,799
happened to to everyone but then during

708
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,240
Co there was a revolution in Belarus we

709
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,120
sided with the Democratic side of it a

710
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,679
video that I posted in response to

711
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,000
violence at the government induced on

712
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,679
people got way more Abus than I expected

713
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,600
we had a raid in our office a way to

714
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,519
retaliate the government took four

715
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,440
people hostage the last one was released

716
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,720
after 11 months in prison that was a

717
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,880
really really hard time we had to exit

718
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,200
bellus we survived and the team there

719
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,640
has shown so much resilience how many

720
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,600
people in Bel at the time at the time we

721
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,519
had 220 people in B wow what are you

722
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,399
actually doing to get them out we had to

723
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,320
employ lobbyist here in the US that was

724
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,399
hard that was a process it was really

725
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,720
tough so they leave where did they go

726
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,960
Ukraine we scale operations out of

727
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,440
Ukraine and then the war in Ukraine

728
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,559
breaks out and for another year and a

729
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,320
half we become a migration company which

730
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,919
enables people to migrate to Poland

731
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,120
Portugal then in belus and Ukraine

732
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,840
completely changed our pnl we had to do

733
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,279
a lot of catchup it's been a tough year

734
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,000
and a half but we migrated to over 300

735
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,480
people out of sight of dictators out of

736
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,279
sight of the war how do you balance like

737
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,279
perspectives on life you're running a

738
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,640
software company it's growing well

739
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,360
things are going well and you have all

740
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,600
these people hundreds of employees

741
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,600
contributing to that and you're like

742
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,120
very grateful for their contributions

743
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,840
and then you're also faced with this

744
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,200
situation where you're the leader of

745
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,640
hundreds of people who are going through

746
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,279
a war actually in this case two separate

747
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,840
types of Wars right how do you navigate

748
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,679
that it feels like a very tricky in the

749
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,760
summer of 2020 at the time I was here in

750
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,880
the US and I was for the first time

751
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,240
visiting Yellowstone and as I walk into

752
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,679
a lake into the lake with kids I'm

753
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,600
thinking oh my God life is so wonderful

754
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,519
I am so lucky everything is working out

755
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,159
I'm so happy in my life and that's

756
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,240
changed dramatically with Revolution B

757
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,640
about 2 weeks after that I started doing

758
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,720
therapy but it was a pretty rough time

759
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
yes one last question so you recently

760
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,559
crossed 100 million of AR how did that

761
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,799
feel when you noticed that actually

762
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,000
happening it did feel good it was not

763
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,120
something that kind of blew my mind pan

764
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,760
back is a very repeatable and

765
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,200
predictable business so we knew when

766
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,440
we're going to hit that Milestone

767
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,799
there's a brand value of this like 100

768
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,360
million AR there's a brand value of the

769
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,399
Unicorn company but it's a you know it's

770
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,600
a short dopamin head yeah you feel good

771
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:05,200
but for a much longer period of time is

772
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,360

773
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,080

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,360
of Acres of forest that are saved uh
