00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,919
Hi Sharks. My name is Kelly

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,920
and I'm Christina. We're from San

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,720
Francisco, California. And today we're

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,880
seeking $200,000 in exchange for 10%

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,480
equity of our company, Yard Sale.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,559
Sharks, if you've ever skied, you

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,440
probably agree with us. Ski poles kind

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,480
of suck.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,359
They're clunky and easy to drop.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,199
Plus, they're made of cheap materials.

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,600
They come in limited colors, and I think

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,439
we can all agree, they're pretty ugly.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,880
We're lifelong skiers and know firsthand

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,400
that people are constantly looking to

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,399
upgrade their ski gear. But when it

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,840
comes to innovation, ski poles have been

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,920
well long forgotten.

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
That's why we started Yardell.

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
Yardell ski poles blend clever design

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,680
and great style for the everyday skier.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
The best part about yard sale poles,

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
they're magnetic. We've hidden magnets

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,280
in the handles in the baskets that they

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
stick together, making walking to and

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,280
from the car or getting on and off the

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,960
lift an even easier experience. Skiers

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
love how yard sale poles are fully

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,559
modular, so you can mix and match

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,320
between the five eye-catching colors on

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,079
our website to create your own custom

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
pair. With Yardell, we're not only

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,159
making ski days easier and more fun, but

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
we're creating a lifestyle brand for the

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
millions of recreational skiers out

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
there.

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
So, Sharks, who's ready to ditch your

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
old poles in the snow and ride the

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
chairlifts with yard sale?

39
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
Oh, I love it.

40
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,000
I just got to ask name.

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Yes.

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,040
Why the name yard sale?

43
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay. Haven't you ever had a yard sale

44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,799
on the mountain?

45
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
So yeah, Kendra, are you like what? Are

46
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,200
you a black diamond skier? You don't

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,840
know what a yard sale is? It's when you

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
lose everything. Your skis come off,

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
your poles come off. It's like they call

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
it like, you know, like a yard sale,

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
like a garage sale.

52
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
So like, does everybody that skis know

53
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,159
that because

54
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
it's kind of it's kind of an insider

55
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
term. Kendra clearly is a skier in the

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
room

57
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,320
and clearly I've had a lot of yard

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
sales.

59
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
And it actually goes a bit back to the

60
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
origin stories of how we actually came

61
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
up with the idea. Christina had a

62
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
infamous epic yard sale or wipe out and

63
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,159
that's where she came up with the idea.

64
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,439
I had a bad yard sale. It got me

65
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,799
thinking about my greatest frustration

66
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
with the product,

67
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
which for me is when you're carrying

68
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
them, they're always crossing over.

69
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
They're falling down. And so I thought,

70
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,159
why has nobody put magnets on ski poles?

71
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
And are you the only one doing this?

72
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
Yes, we are.

73
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,720
I started tinkering with my old poles

74
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,399
and I basically taped some magnets to

75
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
the handles of these. I walked around

76
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,319
the corner to Kelly's house cuz he lives

77
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,959
very close by to me and I asked him what

78
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,440
he thought. No one has ever in decades

79
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
rethought the humble ski pole. Yet every

80
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
skier needs them to ski.

81
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
What are your backgrounds?

82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,760
I've always been passionate about design

83
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,520
and so I was very fortunate to follow uh

84
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,959
that pursuit to MIT where I studied

85
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
mechanical engineering and product

86
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,720
design. Um afterwards I worked at Apple

87
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,360
as a product designer across various

88
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,959
teams and as an avid skier I was ready

89
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
to jump into a consumer product.

90
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
So are you guys full-time in this?

91
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
We are.

92
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,599
We are. Yeah. So my background is more

93
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,000
on the marketing side of things. After

94
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
college, I worked for a um hardware tech

95
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
startup in marketing and then I

96
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
transitioned to the venture capital side

97
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,440
where I was the head of content and PR

98
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
for a VC firm in San Francisco.

99
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
One of the most important things to note

100
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
as well is that over 60% of our

101
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,519
customers online customize their polls

102
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
which means that we have a huge

103
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,360
adoption.

104
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,360
You're not doing any retail, right?

105
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
So we are in a few specialty stores.

106
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
So what's your price compared to a

107
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
regular pole off?

108
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
Absolutely. So we just launched 6 months

109
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,239
ago um and we uh make the product for

110
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,720
about $30. We landed it for 42 and we

111
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,080
sell it for 139. It's 75% margin.

112
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
What are like the average poles?

113
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
Great question. We're in the upper

114
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,640
middle range in the market. So on the

115
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
lower end you have about $50, $60 poles

116
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
which are just cheap aluminum ones, but

117
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
on the upper end you have really

118
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
advanced poles, but we sit really in the

119
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
middle and there's other poles that are,

120
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,680
you know, in our range, but no one that

121
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
offers features like we do.

122
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
What have you sold so far?

123
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah, great question. Yep. In the first

124
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
month, uh, right before the holidays

125
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,319
this past year, we did $100,000 in sales

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
in our first month. So, we are fiscal

127
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,760
year to date uh $220,000 in sales.

128
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
220.

129
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,519
Yes. And we are forecasting to end the

130
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,159
year, which for us ends in September at

131
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
$300,000. Next year, we're forecasting

132
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,560
$2.1 million.

133
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Where and how did you sell them?

134
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Yeah. So, we we launched DOC only. Um

135
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,080
we'll be expanding into retail next

136
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,879
winter.

137
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,319
With with who?

138
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,319
Well, what was really exciting is in our

139
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
first 30 days, we had REI reach out to

140
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,400
us backount dathlon in Europe. When I

141
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
get new poles, I'm in the boots in the

142
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,879
store and we're sizing and the, you

143
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,799
know, we're trying to figure out exact,

144
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
you know, the pose, right? So, what

145
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,480
happens to you?

146
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
Those are a little

147
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Do you need multiple different sizes of

148
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,880
this inventory?

149
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,720
They they come in five sizes. Um, but

150
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,239
that's that's an inventory nightmare.

151
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
Well, we got an answer for you, Mr.

152
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,320
Wonderful.

153
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
What you can actually see in our kids

154
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,440
poles, which are on the far left here,

155
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,040
is that they're adjustable. And we'll

156
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
have adjustable poles for adults next

157
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
year as well. Wait, you mean so they'll

158
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,000
continue to slide?

159
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah. So, actually, as kids grow,

160
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
they'll grow with the thing. I have kids

161
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
from ages 10 to 22, by the way. I don't

162
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
see that out there.

163
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,000
Let me just tell you how I feel. So, um,

164
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
first of all, I don't really love the

165
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,280
name. I think it has a bit of a negative

166
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,080
connotation and an incorrect connotation

167
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,160
for a premium quality brand new item

168
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,840
that's innovative. Yard sale just feels

169
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
like it's a disaster and it's when the

170
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,479
worst thing happens. And then I'm not a

171
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
skier and have to feel passionate about

172
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,639
the product. Love the people, but don't

173
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,919
feel it here. Um, so I'm sorry. I'm out.

174
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
Thank you so much.

175
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,120
I love the name. So when I saw a fubu,

176
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,120
they were like, "What is a foo?

177
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
Is it Italian? Is it Japanese? Is it

178
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,039
number three on the poo poo platter?

179
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
What is it?" And that exactly became a

180
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,919
conversation that stood out from

181
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
everybody. So, you know how many times

182
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,199
people come up here, their name is too

183
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
close to something else, and then they

184
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,520
spend a lot of money and they lose it.

185
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,720
They

186
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
I will say it is one of the biggest

187
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
reasons skiers have paid attention to

188
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,199
our brand.

189
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,160
I agree. I'm part of the the snowboarder

190
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,160
community, and we hate you guys.

191
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,280
So, I I don't know. I just don't like

192
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,039
skiing. Um, this is just not for me. Um,

193
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
so I wish you all the best. Great

194
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,240
innovation. I'm out.

195
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
Thank you.

196
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,840
Thank you, Damon.

197
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,560
I've never skied once in my entire life

198
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,039
and I have no intention of starting. So,

199
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,479
for those reasons, I'm out.

200
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,639
I love this. I love the name. This is

201
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,800
really great. It's catchy, but you know,

202
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
you're early. This is 6 months in.

203
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
You're putting really a $2 million

204
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,800
valuation on a business with what you're

205
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
asking.

206
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
And we realized there's a high risk

207
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,280
behind that. And so, actually, one of

208
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,039
the things that we did was uh we we, you

209
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,319
know, are obviously asking for $200,000

210
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,319
for 10%. Um, but we do have a lot of

211
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
profit margin in our product. And so

212
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
therefore, we do actually have a bit of

213
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
a secondary offer in our back pocket,

214
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
which Mr. Wondery,

215
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
Mr. Wonderful, we'd love to talk to you

216
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,520
about. So, if you're willing, we'd love

217
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,080
to make you an offer of $200,000 for 5%

218
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
with a $3 royalty until you recoup your

219
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
initial investment of $200,000.

220
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,160
That's the first time a company has ever

221
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,160
offered to Kevin a royalty.

222
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
A royalty. You know, we afraid of a

223
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,479
royalty. That's a first.

224
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,919
I would prefer to model it this way. Um,

225
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,160
uhoh. I'll do the 200,000 for 20% and

226
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,919
I'll take my chances on distributions. I

227
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
want a distribution when you distribute

228
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,840
to yourselves, but I want I want to wet

229
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
my beak on this one. I want 20%.

230
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah. Well, yes, absolutely. We'd love

231
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
to talk about what Kevin would have to

232
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
do uh to roll up his sleeves and really

233
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,039
help us. So,

234
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
well, I don't want a job. Okay.

235
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
You know, you just said you need

236
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,120
somebody who's going to roll your

237
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,039
sleeves up. Honey, I've done it. I get

238
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
retail. I get omni channel. I think you

239
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,160
have a great direct to consumer, but

240
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
wholesale is where you can really build

241
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
this business. That's how I started

242
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,880
Kendra Scott. I like I'm going to do 20%

243
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
as well. Plus, I want the $3 back until

244
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
I recoup my 200K. Okay.

245
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,520
Thank you.

246
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
All right. The difference here is I

247
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,160
really do think I can help you with this

248
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
wholesale strategy.

249
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll drop my ash to 15%.

250
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
But I'll take the $3 royalty till I get

251
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,000
back 400,000. So, it's just a 2x.

252
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,840
Would you be interested in doing

253
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,840
$200,000 for 8%. We'll drop that equity

254
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,479
down, but we'll increase your royalty to

255
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,560
$5 a unit until you recoup $300,000.

256
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll do it at 10%. I want the royalty,

257
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
but I want a 2x on it, right?

258
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
That's just going to put us in a really

259
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
tight position in the future. Actually,

260
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,400
we think at five at $5 a unit, we can

261
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,000
actually get you your 300K back if you

262
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
take we'll take that offer within under

263
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
two years.

264
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Getting my money back is not not why I

265
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,879
do deals. I want to get a multiple on

266
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,720
it. Kendra, would you be interested in

267
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,120
that sort of a royalty offer, which is

268
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,120
$200,000 for 8% uh with a $5 unit

269
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,560
royalty until you recoup $300,000 back?

270
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,039
You know what? I actually really like

271
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,240
that. I like that. I do like it. Can we

272
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,599
do 10% and you have yourself a deal?

273
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,599
If you'll drop to 250 on the royalty

274
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
payback, you got yourself a deal. It's

275
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,039
300.

276
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh my god. $50,000 cash. Come on. Will

277
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,479
you up the upfront cash to $250,000 at

278
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
10% with a $5 royalty until you recoup

279
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,760
$300,000 back?

280
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
Done. Done.

281
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,680
Let's go. I'm going to come over here.

282
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
I'm skiing over.

283
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,279
Thank you so much. Thank you, Kendra.

284
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you so much. So much fun. I'm

285
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,360
going to have these everywhere I go.

286
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm so excited. Thank you all. You skis

287
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,480
deserve each other.

288
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
That was insane. Well, Kevin has an

289
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
amazing team, but Kendra was really

290
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,320
Kendra's a she's also a billionaire.

291
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
She is a billionaire and she seemed

292
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
really excited and really genuinely just

293
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
like willing to roll up her sleeves and

294
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,600
help us with all the things that we need

295
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,600
help with.
