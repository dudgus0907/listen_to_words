different sweatshirt I literally fully

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,480
ate mac and cheese in between the clipes

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,879
you just saw which is insane to me

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,000
rather start your day with 12 sodas or

97
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,280
12 eggs 12 sodas that's disgusting it's

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,599
a case easy knock it down you need to go

99
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,799
to a hospital he something disturbing

100
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,120
what I think you have more than 365

101
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,879
sodas a

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,560
year Matt obviously that's disturbing

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,439
that's like that's more than that's more

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,319
than one a day on average but that's

105
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,720
that's obvious that I get more than 34 a

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,280
day or not 34 a day 300 what did I even

107
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,959
just say I think starting a day with a

108
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,480
soda is the best thing you can do I have

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,480
so many people in my life that drink

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,319
coffee in the morning and then they like

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,159
they look at me like I got six heads cuz

112
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,799
I crack a cold one and it's like this

113
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,959
and a and a coffee are very equivalent

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,840
yeah so it's like me having a morning

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,680
soda is the same as yours having a

116
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,600
morning coffee don't look at me like I'm

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,600

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,960

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,520

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,280
in my arms and I'm like no like that

156
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,520
type of I don't like that I don't either

157
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,400
I don't like talking about negativity

158
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,080
and death you're painting the picture

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,800
here yeah but I was more heroic in my

160
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,319
vision you made me seem like a coward

161
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,280
bleeding out on the street no drink

162
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,479
whatever you want for the rest of your

163
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,080
life but it has to have a drop of pee in

164
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,160
it or just water I can deal with a drop

165
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,639
of pee I can easily deal with it I think

166
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,919
it's healthy for you it like cleans the

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,440
system don't go that far I'm serious you

168
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,000
don't have to go that far no I'm serious

169
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,919
people do that sometimes no one does

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,039
that search it up no um Pat a hulaan he

171
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,479
did that from dodgeball the fictional

172
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,319
character patches a hoola hand yeah I

173
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,280
feel like astronauts had to do that they

174
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
put it through a cycle or something this

175
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,280
is liquid that went into your body that

176
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,400
you don't need so it's just going to

177
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,080
continue to do the cycle I just try to

178
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,720
be more cautious and lean the more way

179
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,240

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,959
know when you go through airports

399
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,440
security it sometimes takes like 40

400
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,880
minutes you got to take your shoes off

401
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,079
you got to take your laptop out of your

402
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,639
bag sometimes they're 50/50 with it

403
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,480
because they're obnoxious when you have

404
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,000
TSA pre-check you don't have to take

405
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,600

really F and bingo were going bankrupt

538
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:22,039
rather middle part mat or messy hair mat

539
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,760
um messy hair mat was a joke that was

540
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,200
never supposed to happen that was an

541
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,200
accident I look like an idiot it's what

542
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,360
the twitch stream remember yeah I took

543
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,720

said to me what's up with all this

546
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,799
middle middle part mat stuff I think

547
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,480
they should just be cool with this

548
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,320

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,960
like this is like this is like a random

552
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,159
thing to ramp to rant not rant yeah rant

553
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,000
is the word to rant on right now when

554
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,840
we're filming funny comedy videos

555
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
especially on Twitch streams sometimes

556
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,159
when like there's like

557
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,360
oh like middle when messy hair mat

558
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,039
becomes a thing as of a twitch stream

559
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,760
it's like bro like did you all find

560
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,480
anything else funny this isn't why I did

561
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,200
that you know what I mean it's crazy

562
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,679
streaming for like a full day and like

563
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,039
thinking like oh I made like such a

564
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,039
funny joke at this point I can't wait to

565
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,880
see that on Tik Tok and then it's like

566
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,600
yeah it's messy hair matte how do you

567
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,360
feel about let's play a game of what

568
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,720
does Nick feel about blank flat soda

569
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,159
flat soda when they're like sometimes it

570
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,960
can be a little fun I knew you were

571
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,520
going to say that [ __ ] psycho [ __ ]

572
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,840
that actually pisses me off because you

573
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,080
want to know what my this is like this

574
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,760
right here is like one my no this right

575
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,760
here struck we struck a nerve this right

576
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,080
here is one of my top three things of

577
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,480
life that's so sad no it's not it's your

578
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,559
what's in your top three you should have

579
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
12 eggs instead of no I don't think no

580
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,799
what's in your top three I don't think

581
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,960
Pepsi or soda I'm not expecting to be

582
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,400
soda I'm saying what's in your top three

583
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,039
I don't that makes this seem so

584
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,360
unreasonable for this to be in my top

585
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,520
three like my family and friends okay

586
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,240
like that doesn't count I love soda and

587
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,240
for you to say that like oh sometimes I

588
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,880
enjoy flat soda it's like a mockery it's

589
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
the same people that walk around this

590
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,440
Earth and be like Oh Diet Coke is better

591
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,200

592
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,679
aggravated because it's like it's it's

593
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,880
like no it's not as good it's not as

594
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,799
flavorful it's not as sweet and you're

595
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,039
