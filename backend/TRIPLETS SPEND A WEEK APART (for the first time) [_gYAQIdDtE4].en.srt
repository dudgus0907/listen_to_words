1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,359
stolo Nation we are about to embark on a

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:10,040
journey of which has never been seen or

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,839
done before on the stolo triplet Channel

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,400
and the stolo triplet lifetime

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,160
experience hey everybody Nick speaking

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,080
me Matt and Chris have never been apart

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
for more than 24 hours in our entire

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,119
life the longest I have been apart for

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,039
Matt and Chris is 5 days the longest

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,640
Matt has been alone is 2 days and the

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,279
longest Chris has been apart from us is

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,439
under 24 hours but all of this is about

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,840
to change being triplets we grew up

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,480
together we went to school together and

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
we have done everything together so far

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,920
at this point in our life as we've grown

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
up we want to become less dependent on

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,719
each other and start to do more things

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
as individuals so we can learn from it

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,280
being a triplet is amazing but sometimes

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,120
it's unhealthy how much we rely on each

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,480
other as we become young adults we want

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,960
to learn more about functioning

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,760
completely on our own and we are

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,079
starting by spending a week completely

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,320
by ourselves in this video we all start

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,000

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,079

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,400

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,759

other this and it of itself like the

52
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,159
past two days has been an experience of

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,479
its own because I've never been alone

54
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,280
with just Matt for this long and I bet

55
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,039
it's a dream right and it is it is a

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,399

I've been home alone for two days but

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,239
the week hasn't started yet because Matt

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,080
and Nick are still together but it does

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,360
definitely feel weird being alone and

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,120
away from Nick and Matt um but I'm

72
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,440

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640

going to have to make

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,360

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,680

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,040
the 12-hour flight I have to be on cuz

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,480

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,800
yesterday hello trying to Vlog I was

369
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,959
just in the elevator and two people

370
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,440
walked in and I did not think anyone was

371
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,320
going to show up okay I live guys I'm

372
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
not going to a coffee shop because

373
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,880
everybody's already done and they're

374
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,920
going to meet back at the hotel but I

375
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,920
want to show you guys these vending

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,720
machines oh none of these take American

377
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
dollars well obviously not but they

378
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,440
don't take Visa or Mastercard either

379
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,120
they so I can't get anything but there's

380
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,480
vending machines everywhere like Chris

381
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,759
would be so excited it's just like

382
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,279
there's immediate access to drinks

383
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,440
literally everywhere something I've

384
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,199
noticed that I'm genuinely blessed with

385
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,759
though is I have amazing sense of

386
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,800
direction like if we go like One

387
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,519
Direction and hey I will know how to get

388
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
back is this an

389
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,480
ATM this looks like an ATM to me oh no

390
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,000
that's how you pay for parking obviously

391
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,199
brain dead idiot brain dead idiot

392
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,399
walking through Japan and his name is NI

393
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,880
stola I'm literally next to a [ __ ]

394
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,399
parking garage and I think that the

395
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,120
thing to pay for your parking ticket is

396
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,040
an ATM how much do you miss your

397
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:29,600
brothers on a scale from 1 to

398
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:31,720
10 um right now as crazy as it sounds

399
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,399
I'm glad that they're both not here and

400
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,880
experiencing me while I'm sick because I

401
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,920
just know that they would just like if

402
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,800
this if they were here right now I

403
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,600
wouldn't see them they would go go out

404
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,480
and do things while I was sick and then

405
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,920
when they were home they would like help

406
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,759
me out like get me the meds and stuff

407
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,720
and the stuff that I'm ordering to the

408
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,560
house but

409
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,360
um I'm I'm honestly glad that they're

410
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,639
they're away I miss not being sick and

411
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,199
hanging out with them I'd

412
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,480
say

413
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,319
6.8 out of

414
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,760
10 how are you feeling terrible terrible

415
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,760
terrible terrible sickness wise but

416
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,520
mentally I'm doing fine great I think

417
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,839
the strangest

418
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,319
thing about being alone is like going to

419
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,439
bed and waking up and not like

420
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,319
immediately talking and like debriefing

421
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,559
with them about stuff that's like that's

422
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,440
definitely the craziest one especially

423
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,080
Nick like because he's in like a like

424
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,120
Chris I'll text and [ __ ] before I go to

425
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,679
bed and when like I wake up but Nick

426
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,880
being in like a complete different time

427
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,000
zone is like he'll wake up and answer my

428
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,880
text in the middle of like of night time

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,840
for me so it is really really weird and

430
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,919
the strangest thing so far is just Nick

431
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,679
and Matt not being with me at like when

432
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,720
we go out to family dinners and stuff

433
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,520
and then it's like just me my mom and my

434
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,240
dad and like I'm like the center of

435
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,679
attention and they're like talking to me

436
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,400
cuz normally they talk to all three of

437
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,320
us us but it feels a little weird when

438
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,120
it's just me I am in the nicest hotel

439
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,039
room I've ever been in in my entire life

440
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,480
um I had an amazing day today today was

441
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,559
Madison's first show had a blast it was

442
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,440
phenomenal we took a bullet train to

443
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,520
Osaka so that's where I am that's where

444
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going to bed tonight I don't miss

445
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,600
Matt and

446
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,600
Chris that much I feel guilty every

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,240
single time I say it but what is going

448
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,640
on I'm

449
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,000
fine I think all of this is just me

450
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,600
learning to cope with being an

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,200
individual human being and I'm enjoying

452
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,440
it but I do miss them like I'd love to

453
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,559
have done some stuff with them while I

454
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,760
was here um and this hotel room I'm in

455
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,280
is amazing but it has like compartments

456
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,520
where doors don't close and I'm deeply

457
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,840
afraid of sleeping with like open

458
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,200
hallways um so I'm a little terrified

459
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,600
right now and I wish I wasn't alone but

460
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,960
I had an amazing day today I'm going to

461
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,440
have an amazing day

462
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,919
tomorrow and I love you all

463
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,520
[Music]

464
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:08,679
hello everyone more boring Vlogs for my

465
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:13,960
end here I think we're like at the end

466
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:16,720
of fever town here um all I really have

467
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,120
right now is a headache and a like a

468
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:24,159
pretty bad cough um today I spent

469
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,600
watching professional lacrosse all

470
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,960
day and I also

471
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,080
spent some time when there was was a

472
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,159
professional lacrosse games I watched

473
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,440
the first Harry Potter I want to see I

474
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:40,000
feel like I could potentially be a Harry

475
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,640
Potter fan so like I'm trying to watch

476
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,480
those movies because I really do think

477
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,480
that it's in my potential to like those

478
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,919
movies um also no shock but I did a

479
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,880
bunch of laundry this is just like all

480
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,760
my stuff because obviously I've been the

481
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,039
only one here I just threw the blanket

482
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,919
on here I'm not really good at like

483
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:02,440
making my bed but I made my bed and

484
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,120
washed my sheets and everything because

485
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,120
I've just literally been like sweating

486
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,919
like a pig in them so I accidentally

487
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,559
washed this guy because he was under the

488
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,679
the blanket not sure if I was supposed

489
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,320
to but he's actually much softer so

490
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,919

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,960
Vlog this but I need everyone to know

571
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
how much I'm enjoying this experience

572
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,080
once Chris gets here I'll I'll be

573
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,000
relieved but I don't have like a feeling

574
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,600
of like damn I really miss them right

575
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,279
now it's kind of just like damn I I I

576
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,039
wish like Chris was watching this game

577
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,760
with me stuff like that but it's all

578
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:21,480
good um feeling way better on all

579
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,679
aspects today so great I feel super

580
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,799
super strange that I haven't seen Nick

581
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,440
and Matt it just feels like a part of me

582
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,559
is like gone but um yeah I'm having a a

583
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,000
lot of fun I miss Matt and Nick probably

584
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,880
at like a 10: now um I can't wait to see

585
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
them and just like exchange stories and

586
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,000
like tell them what I've done and what

587
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,679
and just talk about [ __ ] but um I mean I

588
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,840
think this is a great experience I'm

589
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,720
definitely more or less reliant on them

590
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,279
than I thought I was like emotionally

591
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,360
like I've been fine like I'm not like

592
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,799
devastated or sad or upset I just had

593
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,490
the best night of my life I'm not

594
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,240
explaining myself good night

[Music]

596
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,679
I woke up today and I wasn't feeling

597
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,120
like sick at all whatsoever just like a

598
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,559
a very very slight little bit and now

599
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,360
that it's later in the day I feel

600
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,039
perfectly fine I think today is my first

601
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,720
day without sickness which is so amazing

602
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:20,880
and I'm so happy just went out and got

603
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
gas for the car because I didn't get I

604
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,000
didn't leave the car with any gas when I

605
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,679
left for Boston I dropped film off

606
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,039
because Nick had a space camp photo

607
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,159
shoot before he left for Japan that's

608
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,600
what I did today I've also eaten the

609
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,120
same too like I've eaten soup for lunch

610
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,399
and chicken and rice for dinner from a

611
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,000
restaurant every single night um which

612
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,279
probably isn't good but I'm I'm

613
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,159
literally just like eating so

614
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,120
repetitively when Nick and Chris are

615
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,960
around I don't have enough time to like

616
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,200
actually like think about the things

617
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,720
that I would normally think about

618
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,039
throughout the day but now that they've

619
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,200
been gone for multiple days it feels

620
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,600
like I have like two too much time to

621
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
think and it's all just like hitting me

622
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,039
with like negative things and this and

623
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,559
that but it's it is strange it's it's

624
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:14,120
such a weird um weird feelings to have I

625
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:18,279
can't believe that I've haven't seen

626
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,159
Matt or Nick in person in like nine days

627
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:24,039
it genuinely blows my mind

628
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,000
like I just can't believe it I really

629
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,559
can't I think because I had Nathan it

630
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,360
wasn't as hard as I thought it was going

631
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:33,320
to be I'm very excited to see Matt Nick

632
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:36,399
still with Madison running around doing

633
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,440
whatever they're doing um breaking toes

634
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,799
and whatnot the girl's toe is purple

635
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,760

637
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,440
so I hope he's feeling better I don't

638
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,440
want to get sick from whatever he had

671
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,559

attack that was insane we've had that

848
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,920
plan since I was in Boston I figured I

849
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
knew you were going to do something I

850
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,160
just thought it was going to be like

851
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,040
later like I thought it was going to be

852
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,119
like when you woke up no Mariachi on

853
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,800
arrival bam that was so loud and insane

854
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,240
I heard the vent of the

855
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,160
Bucky and also why is Bucky here like

856
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,680
none of this adds up that is the

857
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,839
question of the hour we have Bucky and

858
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,640
