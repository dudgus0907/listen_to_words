spur of the moment so I didn't have time

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,020
last video with Jimbo we we put on our

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,960
Instagram story

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,300
questions to ask our dad but this time

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,579
dad doesn't have Instagram so he used

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,280
Google and it's questions that he has

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,159
written down for us instead that kind of

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,200
randoms random random random is good dad

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,119
you know what I wanted to say if anyone

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,340
asked you like what's your favorite food

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,100
I was thinking about this in length one

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,260
day if someone asked if someone asked

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,840
you what your favorite food was you

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,360
could say spaghetti and meatballs that

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,700
day and then if they get asked the same

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
question like a week later you could

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,420
have seen a burger commercial I love

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
that you're talking about this right now

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,159
it could be different every week

34
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:40,200
that's why there's videos of us like a

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,119
year and a half ago in like a year ago

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,100
where I'm like talking about like oh oh

37
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,380
I thought my matte like mashed potatoes

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,840
and not like but it's it depends on what

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,000
movies

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm so happy Christmas because there's a

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,540
clip of Chris saying I'll never wear

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,020
Stripes again into my life he probably

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,020
wore strike Christmas

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,659
[Applause]

45
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,360
or one of the questions that someone

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,860
asked us like oh what's one of the

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,780
weirdest things that you keep like in

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,000
your nightstand and I had talked about

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,440
in a video how I had garlic salt in my

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,720
nightstand because it was in a phase of

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,400
I was like eating soup a lot and I do

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,920
keep that garlic salt to my nightstand

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,020
but I've moved past this right I have

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,459
more things in my nightstand so when we

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
asked the question on stage and Bob's

56
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,459
Beauty and the whole crowd was like

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,860
garlic salt garlic salt and I was like

58
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,599
what did they say I was like they're

59
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,400
like agreeing and they're all in unison

60
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,800
like I was like ever so they think it's

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,980
garlic salt forever and it's just Alex

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,840

63
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,819
the same page they all said it together

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,680
they all reminded me of that and I was

65
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,480
like oh my God it was just a crazy

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,640
moment so that that's what that's like

67
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,500
cool moments when with the viewers

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,180

favorite even your child no childhood

159
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,759
like all summer I found it really funny

160
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,100
when we went to the cape and Chris got

161
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,020
on a scooter that the handles weren't

162
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,940
matching up with the wheel and he went

163
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,220
to go straight and he kicked like really

164
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,860
really hard but the wheel was broken and

165
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,259
he slid like 30 feet it was raped up my

166
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,000
name

167
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,800
it was just so funny someone else's

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,979
painting it was so funny because he

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,840
connected he could clearly easily ride a

170
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,759
scooter it's just the wheel was broken

171
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,620
so it was just funny because it was like

172
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,319
such a simple task just went so wrong

173
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,380
you see here's where I'm at

174
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,180

was Winter

205
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:33,560
I would say lying down while the snow is

206
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,560
falling I'm just looking at it I think

207
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,550
[Music]

only when I kind of you just want to

215
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,320
hurt people right now I feel like the

216
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,180
two sports that I like the most were

217
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,560
hoggy and Lacrosse

218
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,380
I don't think you could pay me enough

219
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,540
money to step foot in like a lacrosse

220
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,339
goalie ever again oh no it was fun while

221
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,200
it lasted but once I was going home with

222
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,779
bloody shins yeah you need to be a

223
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
little crazy no yeah for sure very

224
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,200
suiting position for Matt but like now

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,700
it's like it'd be so weird if I had

226
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,140

227
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,920

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,760
courses and like

233
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,640
there is stress involved obviously

234
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,860
because you need to cash but you need to

235
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,360
play golf

236
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,980
and like all the foreign animals and

237
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,220
[ __ ] like a kookaburra running around

you like open up in Hawaii and then oh

239
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,180
and then you go to Pebble Beach and it's

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,820
like oh my God how many Pebbles do you

a Mario Kart or like a fortnight like

247
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,940
landing spot okay next question oh I

248
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,920
have to pee Chris what quality would you

249
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,620
want from each brother like what would

250
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,180
you want I would want Chris's creativity

251
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,240
oh that was actually really

252
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,160
complimentary I honestly agree what

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,500
quality would you want them I wouldn't

254
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,339
want Nick's drive and passion on things

255
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,339
he

256
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,519
doesn't like or likes he's very strong

257
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,079
opinionated person uh Matt

258
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,720
I'd want

259
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:55,399
I'd say Chris's creativity is good one I

260
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,240
agree um I also think like Chris is like

261
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,100
simple-mindedness well a lot of you do I

262
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,660
gotta take all of it or can I just say

263
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
something a lot from me Dad can I just

264
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,480
take a little bit well the question is

265
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,180
to take one does it got to be like a

266
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,279
whole thing oh just shut up I take a

267
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,660
little bit of Nick's just anger towards

268
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,060
people because sometimes I feel like I

269
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,560
could be a little bit too kind but it

270
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,420
kind of makes up for NYX a little bit

271
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,519
maybe if Nick's a little extra like that

272
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,440
and yeah more kind we just trade it a

273
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,579
little bit Yeah and then we neutral no I

274
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,959
kind of enjoy hating everyone and

275
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,360
everything okay like this is what I'm

276

all right I feel like a grocery cart's

324
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,000
way too big but a basket's too small

325
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,680
I kind of agree like that that one's a

326
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,720
rare medium so yeah you're not gonna

327
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,339
wheel it around to get a few things in

328
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,980
the store yeah but you don't want to

329
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,420
carry a basket like if you get like a

330
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,160
gallon of milk and put it in the thing

331
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,660
you carrying it's already like kind of

332
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,320
too heavy to be walking around with

333
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,420
absolutely probably get that last

334
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,100
but then if you get it lasted you're

335
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,540
gonna Crush everything that yeah you

336
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,220
can't with the bread yeah it's just

337
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,620
nothing there's quite a dilemma with

338
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,079
that little basket yeah I agree I agree

339
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,480
it's a little basket yeah [ __ ] them I'm

340
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,360
never grabbing a basket I'm basking on

341
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,700
Wheels is money though oh it's so good I

342
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,339
love the basket on Wheels see if you you

343
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,560
know like you'll never catch me carrying

344
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,180
a basket if there's a car in the store

345
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,740
even if I'm grabbing like three things

346
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,720
I'd rather just push the whole card yeah

347
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,760
it's just always hard honestly yeah but

348
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,380
a cart's too big I feel like if I'm

349
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,000
grabbing something that's sometimes only

350
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,720
gonna fit in the basket I'll just use my

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,720
hands um

352
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,100
in the summer and some guy had

353
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,480
flip-flops on and he was sitting at the

354
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,899
front of the grocery store I remember

355
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,360
