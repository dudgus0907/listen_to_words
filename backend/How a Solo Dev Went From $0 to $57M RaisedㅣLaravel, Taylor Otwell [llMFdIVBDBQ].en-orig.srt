1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
try to solve a problem that you yourself

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,319
have. When you have an opportunity to

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,080
build tools that people use pretty much

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,960
8 hours a day, you're making a huge

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
impact. For the first 3 years, I made no

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,880
money on Laravel at all. It was totally

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
open source. I see myself as a very

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,760
average developer. Everything I've built

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,600
at Laravel was essentially solving a

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
problem that I had encountered in

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
reality. When you're building open

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,400
source software, there's a lot of

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
voices. Some of them are coming from a

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
place of like genuine uh constructive

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
criticism and some of them are more like

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,800
haters of your project. Say you're

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
Metallica or you're Taylor Swift. If

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
Metallica starts trying to cater to like

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
Taylor Swift fans, then they lose all of

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,239
their core fans. In the same way, like

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,039
if Taylor Swift changes her core sound,

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,120
she upsets that core fan base. And so

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
play the hits for your fans. They're the

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,480
core piece of your community. I think it

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,960
can be very tempting, especially when

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,719
other like smart people try to tell you,

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
"Oh, I think it should work this way or

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
I think you should do this." The people

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,120
that like sit on the sidelines and sort

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,119
of just like shout criticisms at open

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
source projects. If you were to follow

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,640
their feedback, there's always like

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,240
another like carrot on a stick they're

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,920
dangling out there. They're like, "Oh,

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
thanks for doing that, but I don't like

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,200
this either." And like if you change

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
this, oh, that would be great. You know,

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,720
you keep jumping through the hoops, but

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
they never actually like become a user

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
of the product. do the hardest parts

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,320
first. This is something that I think a

42
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,960
lot of web developers that are trying to

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,640
start new products get wrong. While

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,720
they're the most motivated at the

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
beginning, they build a lot of like of

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,240
the easy parts and then once you've

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
wasted all of your like initial

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,400
enthusiasm kind of dancing around, you

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,560
sort of lost your momentum. Especially

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,799
as a solo founder, I would much rather

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,360
fail after 2 weeks than wasting 3

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,360
months. It's changing from a solo

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,000
developer to running a bootstrapped

54
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
company to now VCbacked company and they

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,759
all work really differently honestly.

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,759
But I think what hasn't changed is

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,200
Hi, I'm Taylor Rotwell. I am the creator

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
of Laravel, an open-source PHP framework

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,439
for building web applications. So I

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,000
started creating Laravel as a way for me

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,480
to build web applications faster. And it

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,440
was actually not my original intention

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
to make it a big popular open-source

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
framework or community. And so the

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,680
community's grown tremendously. We've

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
gone from relatively a few downloads per

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
day when I first released Laravel to now

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,720
a quarter million downloads per day. Our

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,280
first Laracon conference was in 2013 and

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,519
we only had 90 attendees. At last year's

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,760
Laracon in Dallas, Texas, we had over

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
900 attendees. Tons of developers around

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
the world and almost every country in

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,760
the world use Laravel to build

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,760
incredible applications.

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
I grew up in Hot Springs, Arkansas. It's

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
a relatively small town in central

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,800
Arkansas. I was always fairly interested

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,720
in computers and the web as a kid. I

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879
think I built my first website when I

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,200
was about 10 years old. I think I was

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,760
one of the only kids I knew that knew

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,440
how to build anything on the web, which

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
was kind of fun cuz like when you're the

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,879
only kid in school that can build a

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
website, everyone wants you to build a

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,800
website for them. So, it was a pretty

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,640
interesting way to grow up not being

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,959
around any other techy people or kids or

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,400
startups. It's a very different world

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,159
programming and being a developer in

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Arkansas than being, for example, in

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,959
Silicon Valley. But overall, I think

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,840
that being in Arkansas has helped me

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
maintain a level of focus and clarity on

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
what I wanted to build that I probably

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
wouldn't otherwise had if I had been

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
somewhere else. College was a good

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
experience in a sense because a lot of

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
my professors were very old school

101
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
programmers. Some of them had worked at

102
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,319
like NASA. Many of them did not even use

103
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,560
like a guey on their computer, you know,

104
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,360
they were like very old school nerdy

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
programmer people teaching me like core

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
foundational programming concepts that

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
apply across all languages. They really

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
understood the foundational concepts of

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,680
building good software which I think was

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,840
extremely helpful. So when I was working

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,720
just like a day job as a software

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,599
engineer, I always gravitated towards

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,920
building tools for the other engineers

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,920
at the company. like I would always um

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,680
try to get side projects or like get

116
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,919
assigned to build things that would make

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,759
us as developers more productive. So I

118
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,519
was always finding ways to like optimize

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
our workflow and I always found that

120
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,479
like actually more interesting than what

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,560
the business was about. I had some

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,680
businesses that I wanted to build some

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,919
startup ideas and PHP is a web

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
programming language that is very easy

125
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,800
to deploy out onto the web. It's easy to

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
run and maintain and to ship. I needed

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,639
sort of like a toolkit to build these

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
web applications more quickly. And there

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
was other ways to do this in PHP. There

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,199
was existing frameworks that were

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
already out there. Many of them were

132
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
kind of dated and maybe getting a little

133
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,600
older. And I thought that I could build

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,639
a little bit more modern take on how to

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,160
build web applications in PHP. Once I

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
was almost done with it, I thought like,

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
hm, this is actually kind of cool and

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
maybe other people would want to use

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
Laravel to build things. So that's when

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
I decided to open source it, put

141
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,520
documentation around it and try to, you

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
know, share it with the world. And for

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,639
the first 3 years of Laravel's life, I

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
made no money on Laravel at all. It was

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
totally open source. I had sort of

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
written my own scripts to automate this

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,160
on my machine, but I decided to build

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,160
user interface around it and build like

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,440
a product out of shipping Laravel

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
applications to the web. And I called

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,039
that Laravel Forge. And I released that

152
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,639
in 2014. And honestly, I had no idea how

153
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,560
it was going to perform, like how many

154
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,560
customers it was going to have. I still

155
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
honestly expected that I would need to

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,840
work a day job. Even after I released

157
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,320
Forge, but within probably a month or

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,160
two of releasing Forge, Forge was making

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
more money than I was making at my

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
regular job. I was having to do customer

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
support and I was having to fix bugs.

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
Then I was in a situation where it was

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
like very obvious I could not do both

164
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,600
things at the same time. About six

165
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,240
months after launching Forge, uh January

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,800
1st, 2015 was actually my first

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,120
full-time day working on Laravel where I

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
sat down in my home office, which was

169
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,039
basically a spare bedroom at the time.

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
And I was working on Laravel all day

171
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,840
that day and have ever since. The first

172
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,000
couple of years, I was the only person

173
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,600
at the company. So I wrote the front

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
end, I wrote the backend, I did the

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,919
customer support, I did the docs, I did

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,880
everything. And we made our first hire.

177
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,800
I think around 2016 2017 I hired another

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,440
engineer. I think this is actually one

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
mistake I made is I put off hiring too

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
long. This may be common for other open

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,360
source developers where when you create

182
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,199
something open source or you create a

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
product you're like extremely protective

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
of it like it's your you know it's it's

185
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
your thing that you've created and

186
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,120
you're scared that anyone's going to

187
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,880
like come in and mess it up or like mess

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
up your vision for it. And so that made

189
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,160
me very hesitant to hire but then once I

190
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
did I was like oh wow I should have done

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,479
this a long time ago. Running a company

192
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,400
by yourself can be stressful and a bit

193
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,360
lonely. I always felt like Laravel and

194
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,080
PHP was a bit of an underdog and web

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,120
development. Even when I created Laravel

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,520
in 2010 or 2011, PHP was already seen as

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,199
like not the most glamorous web

198
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,039
language. That was nothing new. Like

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,479
even back then, I think that underdog

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,440
mentality of like, okay, well, I

201
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,639
actually think there's something really

202
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,319
great here and I think this is a

203
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
fantastic way to build applications

204
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,759
really quickly, it really motivated me

205
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,160
to like prove it over many years. And

206
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,039
all of them in a way were sort of born

207
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,720
out of my own like desire to make things

208
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,120
easier for developers.

226
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,599
I think opensource is powering almost

227
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,240
every business in the world at this

228
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,000
point. It's become the norm. You can

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
inspect it and read it and you can even

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,639
contribute to it. It's almost like the

231
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
first thought is to release it on

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
GitHub. You know that that's like the

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
most obvious thing you would do if

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,800
you're running an open- source company.

235
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,279
The most obvious risk is just other

236
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,919
people taking your open source code, you

237
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,919
know, and building uh alternatives or

238
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,600
competitors built on pretty much

239
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,120
everything you've done over the last

240
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
decade or however long you've worked on

241
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,560
your project. I think the way you avoid

242
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,480
that in many cases is how you run the

243
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,640
community and how you interact with the

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,399
community. I've always tried to stay

245
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,320
extremely receptive to community

246
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,399
feedback. I'm still very involved. I

247
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,959
actually still the first hour and a half

248
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,480
of my day is getting on GitHub and

249
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
managing pull requests to the open

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
source Laravel framework. I'm actually

251
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,880
still the only person that does that at

252
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,680
the company. I think if you develop an

253
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,240
attitude where you're not listening to

254
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,640
the community and they feel that that's

255
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
when like you start getting grumblings

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,080
in the community, people get unhappy and

257
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,920
then you like run the risk of a fork in

258
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
the open source project. Forks the

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,839
project, renames it. this is now a

260
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,760
better, more community-friendly version

261
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
of your product. That's the biggest

262
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,920
risk. When you're building open source

263
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
software, there's a lot of voices. They

264
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
all have an opinion on where you should

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,720
take um the framework. And some of them

266
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,399
are coming from a place of like genuine

267
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
uh constructive criticism, and some of

268
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,200
them are more like just sort of like

269
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,000
haters of your project. One really great

270
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
piece of advice that another open-source

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,800
founder, Adam Wavin from Tailwind, gave

272
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,040
me was that just like when you're in a

273
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,279
band, say you're Metallica or you're

274
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,080
Taylor Swift, if Metallica starts trying

275
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,959
to cater to like Taylor Swift fans, then

276
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,560
they lose all of their core fans. In the

277
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,839
same way, like if Taylor Swift changes

278
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,760
her core sound that her fans love and

279
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
that they come to her concerts to hear,

280
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,040
she upsets that core fan base. And so

281
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,959
play the hits for your fans. They love

282
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,560
what you build. They're the core piece

283
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
of your community. I think it can be

284
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,720
very tempting, especially when other

285
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,399
like smart people try to tell you, "Oh,

286
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
I think it should work this way or I

287
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,160
think you should do this." It can be so

288
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,079
so tempting as an open source maintainer

289
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,399
to like go down these rabbit holes of

290
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,320
like, "Okay, well maybe if I add this

291
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,120
feature then like this group of people

292
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,519
will finally use Laravel and start

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,600
building with it." In my experience, the

294
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,839
people that like sit on the sidelines

295
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,320
and sort of just like shout criticisms

296
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,079
at open source projects, if you were to

297
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,839
follow their feedback and like jump

298
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,440
through that first hoop of what they

299
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
want you to do, there's always like

300
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,279
another another like carrot on a stick

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,360
they're dangling out there, they're

302
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,800
like, "Oh, thanks for doing that, but I

303
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,640
don't like this either." And like if you

304
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,079
change this, oh, that would be great.

305
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
You know, you keep jumping through the

306
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,680
hoops, but they never actually like

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,079
become a user of the product, which it

308
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,760
can be incredibly frustrating. So listen

309
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,200
to just your core audience that's

310
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,560
already building with Laravel and they

311
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
love what you're doing and they have

312
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,959
businesses on Laravel. It's important to

313
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,680
hear outside feedback too, but just use

314
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,720
caution with how far you stray from like

315
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,839
your core beliefs and what you think

316
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,839
your product needs to be.

317
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,839
I had never really considered taking

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,839
outside investment before Excel. I used

319
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
to get emails about that pretty

320
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,920
frequently and I would always just

321
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
delete them which Excel found hilarious.

322
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,839
The reason for that honestly is just

323
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
like we were happy at the company as

324
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
just a small team working on whatever we

325
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,800
wanted to work on, not wanting someone

326
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,720
to mess up what I had built. So that

327
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
fear of messing up everything we had put

328
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,880
so much work into made me hesitant in

329
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,360
both regards for hiring and raising

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,160
money, especially as developer

331
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,839
expectations have risen quite a bit

332
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,240
since 2011. like the user experience and

333
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,320
the tooling that developers expect. They

334
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,160
expect it to be really really good. The

335
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
bar just like keeps getting higher for

336
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,040
how polished and how productive and how

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,880
great your products have to be. And I

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,720
knew that if we wanted to like take

339
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,639
Laravel to the next level, it was going

340
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,639
to take a lot of work and it was going

341
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
to have to be some pretty ambitious

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
projects that were far beyond anything

343
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,079
we had built before and it was going to

344
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,760
take a much bigger team to build these

345
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,920
things. And so that's what sort of led

346
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,079
me down the path of raising money with

347
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,200
Excel. It's been a gradual process

348
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,680
changing from a solo developer to

349
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,959
running a bootstrapped company to now

350
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,200
trying to lead a VCbacked company. And

351
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,120
they all work really differently.

352
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Honestly, when I was bootstrapping the

353
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
company, it was extremely flat. But at

354
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
the same time, when you go from 10 to

355
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,800
50, there are just new new layers of

356
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
organizational hierarchy and management

357
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,959
that comes with that. But I think what

358
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,880
hasn't changed is our core mission to

359
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,320
build awesome developer tools. Like

360
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
that's still the mission we're on. And

361
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
so like our underlying mission of

362
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
building great products, nurturing a

363
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,639
really great community with community

364
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
events like Laracon and Laravel lives

365
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,920
and meetups, all of that is the same.

366
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,160
But I feel like I should have grown this

367
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,760
kind of team much earlier, but I was

368
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,800
scared to and I didn't know how to

369
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,200
really. and bringing on people that can

370
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,279
help us build these products and help us

371
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
grow this community beyond what I'm

372
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,680
capable of myself. And I'm super excited

373
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,680
to see where we can go in the next few

374
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,680
years.

375
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
When I first released Laravel, we had,

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
you know, like discussion forums about

377
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,399
the framework where people could ask for

378
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,560
feedback or give ideas. Every day I was

379
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,800
in those forums myself, like answering

380
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,120
questions, asking for feedback on new

381
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,680
features and I always try to be really

382
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
involved in the community early. We

383
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
built sort of like a very friendly,

384
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,160
welcoming vibe where everyone can pitch

385
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,240
in and get help. And there wasn't a lot

386
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
of like posturing or judgment on what

387
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
stage people were at in their journey

388
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
with Laravel or with development in

389
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,519
general. We were just all trying to help

390
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
each other and kind of be a part of

391
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,199
building businesses and building

392
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,600
products where people feel like they can

393
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,880
come and learn and and build something

394
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,839
cool and they have other people kind of

395
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,199
have their back. Everyone wants to be a

396
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
part of something like they want to

397
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,120
contribute to something and it if they

398
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,600
feel like they can actually have an

399
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,160
impact on the software which you can I

400
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,880
think for a lot of people that creates a

401
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,639
very strong like sense of belonging and

402
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
community. If you were to pull up a

403
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
contributor list of Laravel, like their

404
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,880
name is now on the list forever. I think

405
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,000
of people like Jeffrey Wei that founded

406
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,760
Laracas creating video content and

407
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
educational material about how to use

408
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,000
the framework. He was actually the first

409
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,120
person to build a full-time career

410
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,720
around Laravel even before I did. By

411
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,880
embracing and encouraging those

412
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,800
relationships, I think it helped build a

413
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,399
really vibrant, strong community. And

414
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,360
it's good for us as well because people

415
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,839
are constantly making content about, you

416
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,839
know, our framework.

417
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,000
I've always said I see myself as a very

418
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,240
average developer, which that sounds

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,399
bad, but I think it's actually been a

420
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
really good thing because there's a lot

421
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
of average developers in the world, and

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,720
I feel like I build tools that helps the

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,880
average developer do their job quickly.

424
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,639
And that is just statistically a lot of

425
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,399
people. When you have an opportunity to

426
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,120
build tools that people use pretty much

427
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,880
eight hours a day at their job, then

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
you're making a huge impact like on

429
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,560
someone's personal enjoyment of their

430
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
life, I think is really interesting and

431
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
amazing and like this huge privileged

432
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
and it's something very few companies

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,199
and software tools really get to do. The

434
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,240
most common advice I give first is try

435
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,399
to solve a problem that you yourself

436
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,040
have. These are the problems that you're

437
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,600
going to understand the most deeply.

438
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,079
Everything I've built at Laravel was

439
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,639
essentially solving a problem that I had

440
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,199
encountered in reality. Many of them are

441
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,880
things that I needed. And I think that

442
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,519
if possible, you should try to build a

443
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,680
business that way to where you are a

444
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,079
customer yourself. The second piece of

445
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,240
advice I would give would be do the

446
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,000
hardest parts first. Um, this is

447
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,399
something that I think a lot of web

448
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,040
developers that are trying to start new

449
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,440
products get wrong. while they're the

450
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,759
most motivated at the beginning of that

451
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
idea, they build a lot of like of the

452
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,480
easy parts. Like they might build, oh,

453
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,040
I'll build the login form first. And you

454
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,720
spend a month or two building all of

455
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,880
these really easy parts, and you're kind

456
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,480
of procrastinating in this like clever

457
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,240
way of tackling the core like hardest

458
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,399
problems you need to solve to really

459
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,320
make this product great. And then once

460
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,279
you've wasted all of your like initial

461
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
enthusiasm kind of dancing around, you

462
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,279
sort of lost your momentum, especially

463
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
as a solo founder. And so for me, when I

464
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,679
have a new product idea, I absolutely

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,160
try to build the most impossible part

466
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,400
first. Like the part I'm not sure that I

467
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,799
even have the skills to build or

468
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,959
understand or whatever. I'll just try to

469
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,640
get that working. Even though it's the

470
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
hardest part, if you do that at the

471
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,039
beginning, you're the most motivated.

472
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
And if you crack it and you nail it, the

473
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
other part is just like it's all

474
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
downhill from there as far as building

475
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
the product. If you fail, you would you

476
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
would rather fail earlier, you know,

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,559
like building the product. I would much

478
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,360
rather fail after 2 weeks than wasting 3

479
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,039
months. So do the hardest part first and

480
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,440
try to solve problems you deeply

481
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,530
understand being customer number one

482
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,640
yourself.
