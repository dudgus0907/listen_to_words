ranking right now would be number one

183
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,199
number

184
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,479
two number two yes get the [ __ ] over

185
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,319
here we don't need to hear the rest of

186
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,280
what you have to say this would be a

187
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,440
really good weapon a bag full of shitty

188
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,440
flavored Hershey Kisses don't

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
Sour Patch Kids coal Sour Patch Kids

190
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,040
ornaments don't Nick don't no like

191
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,279
you're yeah these are these are black

192
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,360
raspberry I've never had those black

193
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,640
raspberry why are you so blown away by

194
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,920
everything cuz what is that black

195
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,160
raspberry Sour Patch Kid

196
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,839
first now these are good to hear me out

197
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,640
I think the reason Sour Patch Kid sees

198
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,120
the success that they see is because

199
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,959
they have a diversity in their bag you

200
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,200
have the orange the blue the yellow the

201
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,000
green like people can pick up favorite

202
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
flavor when you're buying the coal ones

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,800
you're getting strictly Blackberry

204
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,079
flavored sour Pat kits which are good

205
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,120
but I'm not going to finish this bag I

206
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,720
don't need the whole bag [ __ ] like

207
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,760
think of sour Pat did watermelons like

208
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,720
that whole bag is all watermelon like if

209
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,640
this is your ideal flavor I I will say

210
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,200

211
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,720

218
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,279
