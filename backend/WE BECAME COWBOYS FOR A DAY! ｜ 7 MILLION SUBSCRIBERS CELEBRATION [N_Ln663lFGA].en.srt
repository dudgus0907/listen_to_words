3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,639
subscribers I feel like that's the

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:13,240
perfect audible

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,400
reaction I

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,400
personally cannot believe it we need we

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,600
need to commit our sin we have to burn

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,199
something down 7 million 7 million

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,720
people watching our videos makes me want

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,199
to violently puke and scream and

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,519
diarrhea at the same time because it's

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,320
just like it's like an insane

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,640
unfathomable number of people wait a

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,920
second I think we finally have beaten

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,480
the population of Massachusetts don't

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,000
even [ __ ] say that my presence near

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,760
me or by my side yeah 6.9 million we

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,840
have more subscribers than the

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:56,199
population of the state we were RoR

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,640
in I'm like sick wait my stomach hurts

21
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,359
really bad I'm a little disg isn't that

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,320
a crazy statistic not no not a lot of

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,720
people can say that but no guys it's

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,720
like insane when I think about it

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
because me man and Chris have been

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,880
filming some sort of YouTube video or

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,720
Internet content since we were literally

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,840
infant babies and being triplets going

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,360
out and like getting recognized by

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840
people just for being triplets our

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
entire life like people were always

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,240
amazed by that so the fact that kind of

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,360
like I know it sounds like ridiculous

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000
cuz it's not like we're really like

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,560
bringing something to the table in terms

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,640
of like it being a thing but like our

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,439
triplet Hood allowing us to portray

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,960
ourselves on such a massive

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,799
platform is most mindblowing experience

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,719
ever cuz it's something we've always

41
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,680
kind of been chipping away at and it's

42
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,399
just it just continues to amaze me that

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,000
there's people that genuinely sit and

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,680
take time out of their day in the one

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,119
life they live to watch me speak yeah

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,439
it's not real me personally do that for

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,280
you you know it's crazy cuz our career

48
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,960
is built off of the fact that you do do

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,879
that you do sit and listen to me speak

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,280

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,959
where Milkman and cars are on horses

426
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,880
question of the day definitely cars

427
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,520

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,839
with a lantern in

429
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,319

430
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,280

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,240
I don't know why I just looked back

436
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,520
expecting to see like 10 more horses

437
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,679
kick them dude I'm

438
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,640

444
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,280
Ben just fought a little bit

445
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,880
guys um if you noticed us while we were

446
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,360
riding horses thank you so much for not

447
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,799
leaking that we were filming this video

448
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,960
M and Chris were on the horses and as

449
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,000
you just saw or you're about to see we

450
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,200
were in the middle of the street on the

451
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,960
hor my horse was like blocking traffic

452
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,080
for it was insane and then these two

453
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,760
girls were in their car and they were

454
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
like smiling and waving and like taking

455
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,559
photos and I was like oh my God guys

456
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,280
like our our like we filmed we filmed

457
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,880
this early so that because we

458
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,080
anticipated hitting 7 million

459
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,320
subscribers we wanted to make make sure

460
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,720
we could film the video in time so we

461
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,919
were just so thankful that no one posted

462
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,000
that we did this because we were like oh

463
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,000
my God our entire plan for like

464
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,799
celebrating 7 mil ruin is like going to

465
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
be told to the internet and then while

466
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,799
we were on the horses we were going

467
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,240
through a park and some kid was like

468
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,679
asking us to take a photo with him and

469
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,640
we were like I was like a like I can't

470
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,799
really do anything about it so I'm just

471
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,520
happy that whoever we saw didn't post

472
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,720
about it but it was so wild I just think

473
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,600
of how funny would it be if we just

474
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,200
opened our phone and there was no

475
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,280
explanation at all and there was just a

476
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,679
photo of us on horses like in the street

477
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,960
unbelievable I think people would

478
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,320
actually think we've lost our mind I

479
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
don't think they'd believe it at all age

480
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,360
they'd be like what is actually

481
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,720
happening seriously guys I think that

482
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,400
Ben has made it very easy for me to

483
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,159
learn he's giving me a little obstacles

484
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,360
you know learning to kick learning to I

485
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,400

is like if I had a horse I would have

699
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,039

700
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:23,679

when you can just put your phone away

931
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,960
and go do something and touch grass you

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,000
know completely agree I but also this

933
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,800
has been my biggest piece of advice take

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,240
um no not yet with talking about

935
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,520
breaking out into the real world if

936
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,480
you're on your phone and you're feeling

937
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,000
upset and it's bothering you I've

938
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
noticed some of the best advice I've

939
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,960
gotten while being in the social media

940
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,560
space is if you put your phone

941
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,520
down wherever you are right now and you

942
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,240
look around at your

943
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,040
surroundings you are where you are and

944
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,319
your your phone is what's bringing you

945
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,680
these negative Vibes and thoughts so if

946
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:04,880
you're ever feeling negativity from

947
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,440
being on your phone put your phone away

948
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,880
and look at the reality around you

949
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,880
imagine if that's horrible I'm

950
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,160
