1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,480
Space is here. This is not science

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,720
fiction. It's no longer rocket science.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
Space is is an opportunity for a lot of

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,519
biotechs, opportunity for pharmaceutical

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,799
companies.

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,359
In the past, it takes about $50,000 per

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,680
1 kilogram experimentation. But with the

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
SpaceX, Falcon 9, if they launch

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
Starship, which is the latest vehicle,

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,199
it's going to be dropped down about

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,920
$500. 2030 will be the next milestone.

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,920
people live more than six months a year

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,520
in space because commercial space

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
station will replace international space

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,040
station. So it gives a lot of potential

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
and room for many people to utilize this

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,360
assets.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,840
I think people need to start to think

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
about the space station as a laboratory

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,719
for doing research. As long as you have

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
a path, it might not be a FedEx truck or

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
a plane. This is a rocket that you're

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,239
sending to the space station. And it was

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,960
so cool that your product is on that

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,280
rocket. This is no longer a science

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,640
fiction. This is an opportunity to

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,480
really leverage a unique platform for

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:20,250
drug development and drug manufacturing.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,960
My name is Jack Lim, executive director

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
at Borang. Borang is a pharmaceutical

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,880
company. The way we are doing is kind of

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
age of a discovery from like 15th 17th

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
centuries that the European people

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
explore to different American

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,360
continents. I think it's the same type

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,159
of things. We are currently confined in

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,200
blue marble earth. But we all have our

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
mission to explore space. That's why we

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
providing our service as a

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,040
pharmaceutical but also looking at space

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,439
as new growth opportunity as a business

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,399
wise but also provide the right solution

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,439
for humans exploration in space as well.

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,159
NASA commissioner Bill Nelson said

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,640
rockets runs on fuel. NASA runs on

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,200
inspiration. That inspiration will lead

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,360
more and more people to space. That's

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,640
why we are here. We need to be ready to

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,040
send people to space safely. That's what

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,440
all carrying space is all about.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,920
Humans in space challenge is about the

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,599
uh open innovation global challenge

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
program. We are actually trying to

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,319
discover the novel technology who

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,480
actually providing the business service

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,560
as a startup company and also the

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,800
researchers who's willing to send their

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,360
experimentation in space in terms of

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,519
biomedical space healthcare. So we see

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
the space as a new opportunity but we

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,239
didn't know where to start in the

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,160
beginning. We started contacting with

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
all the expertise all over the world.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,080
Luckily I got in touch with one of our

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,239
alumni who is actually the ex astronaut

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,040
in NASA and also professor in Georgia

68
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
Tech and I asked a lot of questions and

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,440
we did a lot of the zoom meetings back

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,360
then and then she kind of help us to

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,840
frame what type of problem we should

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,319
solve. We kind of divide into two

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,480
scopes. The one sector we call critical

74
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,200
problem in space which is we're trying

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,680
to solve the healthc care issues for our

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,840
future astronaut in space. The human

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,080
explorer in space there's going to be

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,920
many health issues that we occur from

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
human body and we're trying to solve

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,720
that problem first and second one we

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,120
trying to we call the critical problem

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,440
on earth which is using space

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
microgravity condition to solve many

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,519
different kinds of health issues on

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,319
earth such as cancer or aging related

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,319
issues. So mainly we have a two scope to

87
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,799
solve the problems through our humans in

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,360
space challenge and then luckily got in

89
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,760
touch with NASA HRP the human research

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
program they actually study very similar

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
type of problem they were trying to

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
solve when you think about NASA we

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
automatically think that they're going

94
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,760
to have all different type of solutions

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,400
right we saw their current work in terms

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,920
of the human exploration and how human

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,760
body risk in terms of low earth orbit or

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,560
lunar and Mars are different kind

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
condition when you send people to Mars

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
it takes at least like six months and so

101
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,400
during the time period of course there

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,639
are many things you should be considered

103
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,040
in that case NASA didn't even know how

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
to solve that problem so even NASA

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,720
doesn't know the problem then there

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,880
might be something that as a commercial

107
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
company can contribute the value with

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,400
all different kinds of the people all

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
over the world but as a commercial

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,639
company we can we are more flexible

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,160
working on this type of initiative so we

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,880
luckily got in touch with them and then

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,479
they became one of our judges in 2022

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
and then the partnership kind of

115
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,120
escalated. We uh get in touch with the

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
Stanford, MIT, Harvard Medical School.

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,199
Everything just starts kind of hard in

118
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
the beginning. The main reason that how

119
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,560
we started and how we actually be able

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,280
to connect with all these you know very

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,310
prestigious partners is because nobody

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,759
started this type of initiative before.

123
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,000
[Music]

124
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,560
We can actually use not only just

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,360
research test bed in space but there's

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,280
actually company who's trying to use as

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,880
manufacturing platform. One of my

128
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,960
favorite company called the lambda

129
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,880
vision. They actually developing new

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,479
artificial retina in space.

131
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,639
Lambda vision participated in the human

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
in space challenge in 2023. We had to

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
come up with a pitch competition and we

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,000
pitched in front of a a large audience.

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
You know people came by and and talked

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,400
to us at our our individual booths. We

137
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,320
were a winner that year that supported

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
us to do some additional research in

139
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,919
microgravity. We were really excited

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,520
about the results that we got from space

141
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
because what we're showing is that we

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,440
can actually get a more even stable

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,440
product. What we did is we took a those

144
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,960
open beaker experiments. You cannot fly

145
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,759
open solutions on the International

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,440
Space Station. Flew that in a box. So

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,360
the box that we're flying is about the

148
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,759
size of a shoe box. I didn't think it

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,840
was possible. It's just wasn't first

150
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,360
thing on my my brain. There's actually

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,120
some of the case that some of the

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,280
startups they haven't thought about

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
applying their current prototype model

154
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,319
to kind of apply to space. They never

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,080
thought about that. But space will be

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,039
you know kind of next opportunity for

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,039
them to develop kind of long-term phase.

158
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,199
Our main road is we connect the right

159
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,400
teams to right partners so that they can

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,240
send their R&D and research to right

161
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,479
platform. When it comes to fund we have

162
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
a different model like one equity state.

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,560
We actually invest their equity in the

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
company but at the same time we also

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,880
investment model called orbital launch

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,639
funding which we cover their space

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,479
launch cost for their specific

168
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
experimentation. The people who apply

169
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,199
those program we have a right procedure

170
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,520
for our judge process. So each

171
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
individual judge they actually review

172
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,160
each individual applicants and then

173
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,479
mostly equity state companies obviously

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,720
we see them as a investment opportunity.

175
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,560
So our venture capital partners also

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
looking at taking a look at that company

177
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
as a potential for the investment. I

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
mean running our business initiative is

179
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,360
a very smart way because we only invest

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,759
like $100,000 for startup equity but at

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,919
the same time we connect with your most

182
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,479
space agency like NASA European space

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,240
agency issa

184
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,880
we supported them through the funding

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
and two we have our internal own

186
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
accelerator program it's called humans

187
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
and space accelerator program we are not

188
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,360
space company we're not fully expertise

189
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,440
of space healthcare but we know how to

190
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
create actual the platform that we can

191
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,280
connect right people with our right

192
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,840
partners not only just the research

193
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,080
level but also the uh the platform and

194
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,039
utilizing space environment for those

195
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,520
people as well.

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,280
This is a really good time to get

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,960
involved and and we're also building

198
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,160
something from the ground up doing a

199
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,240
blueprint of of the future in 10 20

200
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,919
years. You're you're being pioneering

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,120
not just what you need today but what

202
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,240
are you going to need in 5 years? What

203
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,599
are you going to need in 10 years? Where

204
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
do you think the industry is going to

205
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,599
go? When you're doing new things it can

206
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,120
be very challenging. It doesn't always

207
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,120
feel like you're doing the right things,

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,199
but if you're stagnant, you're not going

209
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,199
to grow.

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
One of the thing that I realized running

211
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,440
the program was how individual

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,759
researchers and startup actually work on

213
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,759
different kinds of problems when it

214
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
comes to space exploration also trying

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,520
to solve the problem on earth. We saw

216
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,680
how they are scattered, how they are not

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
be able to connect each others because

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,000
each individual technology and research

219
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
has a lot of values and potential but

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,839
they just don't know how to connect with

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,839
right partners. I think we have a pretty

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,240
good network in terms of all the

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,640
prestigious university level and also

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,200
space agency level historically conduct

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,279
numerous space related research before.

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
So we can make sure that connect the

227
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,680
right people who is a very kind of

228
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,480
similar research experiments with our

229
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,800
expertise.

230
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,399
One of the great things though about

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
being part of these challenges are the

232
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,519
people that you meet. The only way we're

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,760
going to be successful is if we all work

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,640
together. In order to do something very

235
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,480
very bold, very very visionary. You need

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
to have a lot of thought leaders in a

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,519
room working together to accomplish

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,000
that. So many of the people that I met

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,800
during that experience uh we still are

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,680
sharing ideas every place that I've gone

241
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,920
the energy from the other entrepreneurs

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,839
uh the excitement in the space that also

243
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,640
helps to keep you going. When people

244
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,800
talk about space, it's um very

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
complicated. It's very difficult concept

246
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,080
to understand. But the International

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,480
Space Station, it's actually built 1998.

248
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
It's about 20 years from now. The way

249
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,320
we're trying to have the space

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
healthcare ecosystem, not only just

251
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
running the humans in space challenge,

252
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,480
but actually we trying to secure the

253
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
right infrastructure to provide the

254
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
experiment service platform. It's not

255
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,519
like a new concept. I think it has been

256
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,760
established from ever since

257
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,839
International Space Station built, but

258
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,160
there's no one actually trying to play

259
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,959
the way we're doing it. So that's I

260
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,959
think a pretty big value.

261
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't be afraid to take the risk. Be

262
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,399
bold, be visionary. This is a very uh

263
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,640
you know pivotal time for for space

264
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,200
research. But I would also tell them

265
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,320
that opportunities in space are not just

266
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,320
for scientists and engineers. Right now

267
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
there are opportunities in space for

268
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,440
people developing space suits for people

269
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,760
sewing in space for insurance in space

270
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,920
hotel and hospitality anthropology in

271
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,320
space. Where you start might not be

272
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,399
where you you end. I think the most of

273
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,279
startup they change their business model

274
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,200
very frequently but I think um space

275
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,920
will be you know kind of next

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
opportunity for them to develop kind of

277
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,040
long-term phase. I want those startup

278
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,480
out there to look at space as a new

279
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,160
opportunity or testify or apply your

280
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,560
current business model or your current

281
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,800
technology in space. Everything that

282
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,640
we're doing it's pretty much like a

283
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,839
first step. Space healthcare is a very

284
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,800
rare topic but at the same time we are

285
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,440
leveraging healthcare society to break

286
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,399
into space economy space industry is

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,839
obviously intersect between two industry

288
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,000
in one program together.

289
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't think

290
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:30,440
