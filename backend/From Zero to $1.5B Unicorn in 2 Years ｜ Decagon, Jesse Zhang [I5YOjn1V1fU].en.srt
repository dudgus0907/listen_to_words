1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,960
every startup's biggest Advantage is

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,480
you're obviously able to move quicker a

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,879
VC might ask you it's like okay what

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,040
what do you do when Google starts doing

5
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,639
this honestly a lot of our advisers or

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,960
investors were telling us hey support is

7
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:13,160
going to be too crowded it's like such

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,799
an obvious idea my name is Jesse I'm one

9
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,920
of the co-founders here at deagon deagon

10
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,760
builds AI agents primarily for large

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
corporations on the customer support

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,480
customer experience side as a team we're

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
able to hit seven figures ARR in about 6

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
months and uh have been growing quickly

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,039
since then we're always just looking for

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,490
more customers more folks to work with

17
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:37,760
and we're growing the team as

18
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:40,200
[Music]

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,320
well I was born and raised in Boulder

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,360
Colorado I grew up doing a lot of things

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,239
like math contests science research

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,640
stuff like that and I ended up studying

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,039
computer science at Harvard I would say

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,239
I was very focused on trying to build

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,480
something and so most of the time I

26
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,120
spent outside of classes was towards

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,359
like learning how to build things

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,199
talking to my friends about building

29
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,760
things I finished College fast for a

30
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,480
bunch of different reasons I thought

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
that I had already gained what I needed

32
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,080
to from from college and I was excited

33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,520
to just start building things and so at

34
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,240
Harvard there's a program that allows

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,280
you to graduate a year early pretty

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,960
easily after Harvard I started my first

37
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,200
company it was a very different startup

38
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,680
we eventually got acquired by Niantic

39
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,159
then decided to start this company so

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,680
specifically the problem we're solving

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,560
is a lot of these companies have very

42
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,680
large not that efficient operations in

43
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,880
terms of answering customer questions

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,119
looking up data dealing with tickets and

45
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,920
many of them will Outsource to large you

46
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,560
know bpos and things like that to have a

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,880
lot of human agents answering and so if

48
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,880
you're able to use some of the new

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,880
generative AI technology you're able to

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,920
automate and just improve the customer

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
experience by answering all of these

52
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,200
questions automatically looking up data

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,000
automatically doing all the sort of

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,360
things that a human agent would do every

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,960
startup's biggest Advantage is you're

56
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,159
obviously able to move quicker you can

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,000
kind of cater towards the customers a

58
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,719
lot more and make sure that you really

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,039
capture their needs a VC might ask you

60
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,680
it's like okay what what do you do when

61
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,439
Google starts doing this honestly a lot

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
of our advisors or investors were

63
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,360
telling us hey support is going to be

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
too crowded it's like such an obvious

65
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,799
idea but on the flip side that's also a

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
great a good thing because it allows you

67
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,679
to get to adoption very quickly because

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
our customers also see the value when

69
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
they start using it they immediately get

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
Roi this is what our customers are

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
telling us our customers are telling us

72
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,920
that there's need here that they're

73
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,680
willing to pay for a solution if it

74
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,800
works and so that's kind of what led us

75
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
there that's also what's made us

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,360
successful in terms of competing against

77
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,640
the older generation of chat Bots

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
because if our customers were happy with

79
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,360
those then they wouldn't have told us in

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,920
the first place they wouldn't have even

81
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
mentioned that hey we're willing to try

82
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,920
you out and so we're able to basically

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,879
capture a lot of the newer needs and a

84
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,000
lot of what was not possible before by

85
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,000
building from the ground up using

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,319
generative models a lot of older players

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
they will have a huge product built

88
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,800
already and they probably have hundreds

89
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,319
of customers and so when they're

90
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,040
shipping new features they have to build

91
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,080
things that kind of satisfy the average

92
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,319
customer they're just slower to adapt

93
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,080
because they have to carry along all

94
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,599
this product they've already built out

95
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,319
so I think when you're a startup like us

96
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,920
we've done a good job at executing and

97
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,599
so we we move really fast there's been a

98
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,000
new technology introduced right large

99
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
language models if you just think about

100
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,640
the more traditional chat Bots where

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
there's some intelligence built in but

102
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,159
it's it's not AI it's not generative and

103
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,519
if you're able to adapt faster then you

104
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,720
have a big Advantage when you're

105
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,000
competing against them I think we've

106
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,040
just built a better product hi I'm T

107
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,959
from if you are enjoying this video

are content and opportunity in growing a

114
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,239
startup I wanted to share a free

115
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,560
research that I would have loved to have

116
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,360

that first wall of fundraising you're

121
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,239
good at building what you do but

122
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,439

thanks to Hotpot for sponsoring this

134
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,160
video now back to the

135
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,199
[Music]

136
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,840
story when we first started we were very

137
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,560
open-minded uh we were not super

138
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
opinionated about like this is exactly

139
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,840
what we need to build we kind of just

140
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,000
let our customers tell us what the need

141
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,479
is when you're early it's it's hard to

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,919
have a very coherent strategy you're

143
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,479
just trying to get as many customers as

144
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,440
possible and so in the early days it was

145
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,320
just us trying everything we could to

146
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,960
get new customers get new introductions

147
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
things like that and with each customer

148
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,039
we would have the same process of going

149
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639
in and really trying to understand what

150
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,199
they needed and what they wanted instead

151
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,160
of trying to push like our product

152
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,080
Vision on them for a lot of our early

153
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,199
customers vanto would be a great example

154
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,600
vanto was one of our first customers we

155
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,120
just kind of came in with the mindset of

156
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,880
hey you may have some issues that uh

157
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,320
you're dealing with and we just want to

158
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
see if we can solve them in a good way

159
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,840
and I think if that's your mindset then

160
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,199
it makes it easier because you're again

161
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,919
putting the customer first and like

162
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,120
really being customer-driven fortunately

163
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,560
at the time they actually did have a

164
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,360
very concrete situation which is around

165
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,280
you know having automation to answer

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,280
customer problems it's a complicated

167
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,440
product and so when people come in they

168
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
have a lot of questions and if you're

169
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,520
able to answer them well then customers

170
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,240
are happy and they're happy so that's

171
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,000
how we got started we were able to ship

172
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,360
a initial version very quickly they

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,199
liked it and then we tested out on on

174
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,880
real customers and they liked that as

175
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,520
well and so we just went from there for

176
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
the first 6 months we didn't build

177
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,120
anything that wasn't a direct request

178
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,800
from one of our customers and now

179
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,880
obviously we're slightly farther along

180
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,520
so we we have our own views on what

181
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,800
makes a good product but we still are

182
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,840
extremely customer first we really love

183
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,240
talking to our customers they give us a

184
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,360
lot of Direction and that's how we

185
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,199
approach product

186
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,560
building my first company low key was

187
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,520
very different from what we're currently

188
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
building first of all it was a consumer

189
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,479
company and so we didn't have pain

190
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
customers off the bat we were much more

191
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,400
concerned about getting users and

192
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,400
getting a lot of them very quickly uh

193
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,880
what we did was we were building

194
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,199
software for people that played video

195
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,160
games to capture their Clips edit them

196
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
share them and just you know explore

197
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,360
Clips in general by far it was just

198
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,160
being a new grad and not knowing much

199
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,639
about stuff I was a solar founder for

200
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,120
most of it I didn't really know like

201
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,919
what things were important to work on

202
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,919
what things weren't I didn't really know

203
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,520
how to evaluate of a good idea if an

204
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,639
idea was good or not every day you're

205
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,080
working hard but maybe you're not

206
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,759
working on the right thing and just you

207
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,599
know after few months go by it just

208
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,639
feels like a lot of the time was wasted

209
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,840
so I think that's very natural for

210
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,039
firsttime Founders because especially

211
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,759
younger ones because you don't really

212
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,120
have that perspective what kept me going

213
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,520
was more just yeah being young and

214
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
having a lot of energy and being a

215
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,240
little bit naive is also helpful because

216
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,759
you don't really have that much

217
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,599
perspective on how hard things are or

218
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,000
how hard things can be so that that was

219
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,720
by far the hardest part for me I think

220
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,840
being a consumer um exaggerated that a

221
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
bit because there is not really like

222
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,160
customers paying a lot of money that you

223
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
can talk to and like all right what do

224
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
you need I'll build it so that was by

225
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,800
far the hardest um once you start

226
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
scaling of course you know what you're

227
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,919
building but there's still that element

228
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,280
of okay you know you're at 10,000 users

229
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,479
how do you get to 100,000 and once

230
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,960
you're at 100,000 users how do you get

231
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,199
to a million and the answer for those

232
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,120
might not be the same and you have to

233
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,000
keep figuring out new things to try and

234
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
and things like that and then for that

235
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,440
company you eventually have to figure

236
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
out how do you make money so that's a

237
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,360
whole another phase yeah for me the

238
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,080
first part is definitely the hardest as

239
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
a Founder you can always overthink

240
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,039
things and you can always rationalize

241
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,160
different things but at the end of the

242
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,680
day it doesn't really matter you just

243
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,680
have to get to a point where you have

244
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,360
customers that really appreciate and

245
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,960
value what you're doing and that speaks

246
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,400
for itself in terms of the growth of the

247
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,199
business so this time around when we

248
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,919
were in the very early stages of

249
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,560
building decagon my co-founder Ashwin is

250
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,440
very similar background also

251
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,400
successfully sold the company before we

252
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,440
just decided hey let's not overthink it

253
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,919
we just want to go out there and see

254
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,960
what people actually want and what

255
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,639
they're willing to spend money on and

256
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,360
that just made the initial ideation

257
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,520
phase much easier uh and we really did

258
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,120
not want to spend too many cycles you

259
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,960
know going back and forth in that in

260
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,400
that stage so I think number one you

261
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,039
need to line up a lot of customer calls

262
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
and so you can get those from asking

263
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,919
your friends to introduce you asking

264
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,680
your investors to introduce you reaching

265
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,120
out cold and once you have them set up

266
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,039
you want to make sure the calls are very

267
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,159
structured and after you leave the call

268
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,960
you feel like you like learn something

269
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,479
concrete and so part of that is you know

270
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,759
you have an exploratory phase where

271
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,879
you're kind of just listening to their

272
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,400
problems and seeing like what could

273
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,599
possibly be solved and then the next

274
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,319
phase of the call is you're generally

275
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,399
talking about hypothe IAL Solutions and

276
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,719
then the last part of the call is super

277
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
important to get a sense of like how

278
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,080
much people would pay for it because

279
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,399
many times you could get in a

280
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,479
conversation where people are telling

281
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,519
you oh this would be super useful but at

282
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,880
the end you know there's no budget or

283
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,680
they would only be willing to pay a

284
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,000
decent a little amount and how much

285
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,480
they're willing to pay for it is the

286
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
only real metric for how useful it is to

287
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,200
them really and so if you're able to

288
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,399
have a call like that then after the

289
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,600
call you're like okay well we talked

290
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,760
about these things and I feel like this

291
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
would be really useful to them or it'll

292
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,240
only be kind of useful to them and once

293
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,839
you you've had enough of those calls um

294
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,480
that's like the real signal and as I

295
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,279
mentioned before people were telling us

296
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,040
at the time that customer support agents

297
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,600
customer experience is super crowded

298
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,760
it's like too obvious of an idea but

299
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
when we had a lot of these calls that's

300
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,839
what people were saying so it just it

301
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,959
means that there's a need and people

302
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,519
feel like there's Roi there for them to

303
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,160
adopt something uh I think when you're

304
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,160
young the biggest disadvantage is you

305
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,600
just don't know how things work really

306
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,920
um you might feel like you're very smart

307
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,480
or you can work really hard but you

308
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
don't really know like how you make

309
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,720
revenue or you don't really make know

310
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,320
how like companies in general so I think

311
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
the biggest thing is just uh staying

312
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,160
patient with that and trying to talk to

313
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,000
as many people as possible to get that

314
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,320
intuition the biggest Advantage you have

315
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,600
when you're younger is you just you can

316
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
put a lot of hours in and work really

317
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,240
hard I think for me I would just

318
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,120
describe the difference between you know

319
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,920
a lot of successful entrepreneurs that I

320
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,200
know and you know not so successful ones

321
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,680
is mainly just like intensity so I think

322
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,839
a lot of our friends who have built huge

323
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,000
companies or a lot of our advisers or

324
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,560
investors uh they all have intensity I

325
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,519
think it's impossible to build a big

326
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,800
company without intensity and intens

327
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,120
just kind of means like you know you're

328
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,040
always going you're always pushing you

329
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,000
have a very like no excuses attitude

330
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,480
where you just get things done and

331
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,279
that's what we admire about a lot of the

332
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,839
folks who you know help us and that's

333
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,640
what we want to have in our DNA as well

334
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,600
I don't know if we have the best

335
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,360
perspective to give advice on like a

336
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,720
global sort of AI Space level I think

337
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,880
for us the way we think about it is

338
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,760
there's like the core fundamental

339
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,800
players who are building new language

340
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,560
models and building new infrastructure

341
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,480
we of course sit on top of them we we

342
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,560
are an application we interface with our

343
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,000
end customers if you're building in a

344
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,839
space that is deep enough and it's

345
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,800
complex enough to have like a bunch of

346
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,440
features a bunch of product decisions

347
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,680
and a pretty just like a pretty big and

348
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,760
deep product no one really is going to

349
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,560
be able to replace your application

350
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,760
because you know the big players are are

351
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,040
building models right they're they're

352
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,200
not in the business of building like

353
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,680
customer support agents so I think

354
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,040
that's one piece which is what you're

355
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,240
building has to be deep enough and

356
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,720
complex enough for it to like be its own

357
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,639
product and be its own company and I

358
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,839
think there's a big Advantage when you

359
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,600
are the one interfacing with end

360
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,000
customers cuz when you're interfacing

361
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,399
with end customers you're the actual one

362
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,200
that understands their needs and this

363
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
goes back to what I've said many times

364
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,279
which is you have to have a good

365
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,399
relationship and a deep relationship

366
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,680
with your customers like really

367
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,360
understand what they need and everything

368
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
they say and everything they do gets

369
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
baked into your product you're the only

370
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,240
one that has that right because all the

371
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
big players and the like Googles of the

372
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,440
world the cloud providers like you're

373
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,680
building on top of them but they're

374
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,279
never going to have that access to the

375
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,560
exact customers I think if you're

376
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,480
building an application that that's

377
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,240
important uh if you're trying to make

378
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,279
sure that you know a big a big player

379
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,440
doesn't come around and just replicate

380
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,440
your product
