[ __ ] that I oh my God remember when I

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
lost my air pods yes uncle got his

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,780

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,180

69
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,920

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,239
lost it was like you should you sh

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,739
should respectfully like you were out of

73
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,080
respect for getting them as a gift that

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,560
you need to re-buy yourself earpods

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,720
earbuds what I sound like yeah your

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,360

80
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,940
found them in our couch which is crazy

81
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,700
because Mom cleans the couch like every

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,440

83
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,920
our couch was it ours that's the crazy

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,720

89
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,680
guy to be [ __ ] obnoxious and annoying

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,180
and then take eight years to say a

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,860
sentence like that's not what it doesn't

92
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,340

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,360
guessing is like a sibling or a parent

222
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,660

225
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,020
where to go

226
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,699
you would do yeah if you say it like too

227
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,240
many times fast it sounds kind of like a

228
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,160
a chant like a spell okay you know what

229
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,680
I mean no I don't think it sounds like a

230
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,800
rhythmic spelled chat Nick you just

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,599
looked at me like like what

232
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,339
it looked like you saw like something

233
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,839
crazy for a second like the way you

234
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,300
looked and you're like I was just

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,979
thinking

236
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,719
all right let's keep going sometimes I

237
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,459
don't think there's anything that like I

238
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,380
can there's a lot you did that was weird

239
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,660
as [ __ ] like what just being yourself

240
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,040
and you're okay

241
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,959

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
kid you were weird Matt was weird

243
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,440
really good apple flavored toothpaste

244
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,519
I feel like that's not a habit that's

245
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,160
like why'd your parents even buy you

246
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,459
that [ __ ] because I was like sick that's

247
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,019
not no that's not a habit though

248
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:11,220
Colgate press as a kid it doesn't matter

249
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,540
it doesn't matter that's not a habit

250
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,680
that's a one and done thing unless

251
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,779
you're eating like she literally said

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,459
it's not weird it's like a nasty I ate

253
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,720
the really good yeah but it could be a

254
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,860
habit like if she kept getting an apple

255
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
too that's what I'm trying to do but

256
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,399
also don't you doesn't isn't it like you

257
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,500
always eat the thought of eating

258
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,180
toothpaste in any form is really good

259
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,560
it's like I mean you're only supposed to

260
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,600
spit it out to the floor right and stuff

261
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
like that that's not true because not

262
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,320
every toothpaste has fluoride most of it

263
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,760
does just a small person okay I'm not

264
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,399

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,740

head and body which is

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,300
crawl around rather than hops see

384
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,620

453
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,760
nothing's going on in preschool what

keep saying this but like what's the

459
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,880
evidence you were just strange like you

461
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,919
mirror everything yeah that's like the

462
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,080
weirdest show every time Nick would like

463
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,460
it was almost like I'm settling it with

464
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,260
myself like I was like you can't sleep

465
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,600
let's go figure this out and I just go

466
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,520
and figure out why Nick you said dry off

467
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,039
like once he opened the door like I

468
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,760
remember that like come on I'm being for

469
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,100
real

470
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,320
yes it is

471
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,419
seven six years old Nick would shower

472
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,940
get out and then like open the door and

473
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,080
dry off like naked like I vividly

474
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,299
remember that like when we were like

475
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,280
seven six years old like just swing the

476
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,539
door open to start drying off after a

477
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,580
shower

478
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm being honest and you still don't

479
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,900

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,940
know see terrible joke you guys always

481
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,559
make these stupid jokes that I like

482
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,780
don't try to shower just as frequently

483
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,520
as you guys it's like it's like not even

484
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,039
funny you're the like kids that would

485
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,220
roll around in the mud and [ __ ] no that

486
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,720
wasn't that Matt was the dirty one Nick

487
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,860
no Matt gave like really just like like

488
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,280

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:48,059
oh my God imagine someone goes not

493
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,960
caring when I saw a ghost because of how

494
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,000

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,240
and what is going on what are you

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,900
talking about not caring when I saw a

497
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,299
ghost because of how normal it became

498
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,039
like girl

499
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,720
I feel like we're being spied on there's

500
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,700
people

501
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,880
when I needed to pee I would just do a

502
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,880
dance

503
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480

leg crosstalk flip people off all the

506
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,900
times they didn't know what it meant I

507
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,400
love that if a little kid ever went out

508
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,440
to me and flipped me off in a store I'd

509
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,539
be like happy about it yeah I agree I

510
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,220
flipping back off though yeah

511
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,419
sometimes I'll see you we're trying to

512
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,760
scare little kids while their parents

513
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,919
aren't looking in public no I've done

514
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,000
that once like a kid like a mom like I

515
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,160
was like I think I was in high school

516
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,419
and this this mom was like pushing her

517
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,039
kid in the stroller and she was like

518
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:47,240
shopping and like she turned her back

519
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:50,039
for a second and I was like like

520
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,900
a little kid I would cry if I was a

521
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,900
little kid literally be traumatized

522
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,340

524
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,820

525
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,260
what [ __ ] hit the toilet for me I was

526
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,000
never reaching my head I feel like Nick

527
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,000
would do that [ __ ] no I wouldn't oh

528
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,520
our main light source is that

529
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,380

530
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,380
