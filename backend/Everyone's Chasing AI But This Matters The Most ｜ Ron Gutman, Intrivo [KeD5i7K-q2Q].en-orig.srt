1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
The most uh profound experience that I

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,839
had in my career uh in healthcare and

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,000
one that I consider my most important

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,960
accomplishment was uh in in my previous

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,559
venture to to get more than 25,000 notes

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,760
from people saying thank you for saving

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,359
my life. I mean the the really like

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
amazing it was profound. I mean like

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,800
it's you know from somebody who's uh who

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
had dreams as a child as a you know a

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,960
computer geek to to build things that

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
that have some impact to to really get

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
you know tens of thousands of notes for

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,079
people saying thank you for saving my

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,760
life is something that uh you know

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
it's bringing me to tears right now just

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
to talk about this right I mean it's

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
it's it's really like I getting I'm

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,160
getting goosebumps and and I think that

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,719
like the the it's it's just it just it

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,480
really is special always do what you

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,079
love.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Always do what you love, right? Like,

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
start by doing what you love. I mean, a

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,280
lot of people choose to do things

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,199
because they're cool, uh, because

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,199
they're going to make a lot of money,

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,359
uh, because it's fashionable, uh,

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,799
because somebody told them to do that,

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,920
because other people are doing that,

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,600
right? Like a lot of reasons. Just don't

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,119
like go into where your heart is, right?

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
Like do things that you love. Why?

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,720
Because when you do thing that you love,

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,799
it doesn't feel like work and you're

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,720
going to become a lot more successful

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
and happier most importantly. It's not

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
just about success. You want to be happy

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
in your life. So follow your real

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,720
passion and then everything else will

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
follow like the the money, the fame, the

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,800
whatever you want to do when you do

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,170
things you love, they will come.

[Music]

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,799
Okay. Nice to meet you. Uh my name is

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,439
Ron Goodman. and uh co-founder and CEO

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,520
of uh Intrivo. We really like at the

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,759
beginning of Invo the the vision was to

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,840
to bring health and care to you where

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,640
you are. Now when the pandemic started

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,720
we tried to see where we can apply this

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
to actually help resolve the pandemic

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,960
and then we start solving the challenge

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
of how do we bring efficient testing to

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,600
use. So initially testing if you

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
remember was a terrible user experience.

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,599
We created this technology platform that

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
enable us to manage the entire supply

59
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,080
chain. And I really would like to be

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
part of creating a solution like that

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,480
that will change the way we manage our

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,640
health and well-being in ways that were

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,120
just not possible before. And I think AI

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,720
has a a great opportunity to be the

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
foundation for that. And I'm looking

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
forward to the next chapter of uh you

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
know how humanity managing not only

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,599
health and well-being but happiness as

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,240
well because I want more people to smile

70
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,969
a lot more often.

[Music]

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,239
The whole idea of helping other people

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,680
uh came from home. My mom uh raised me

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,640
with the the notion of tikun lam

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,640
which is an ancient uh part of Jewish

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,200
philosophy and tikunol lam means in

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,440
English very simply fixing the world.

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,519
What does fixing the world mean? My mom

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,879
used to explain that fixing the world is

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,959
something that is important for me to

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
engage in just because the world needs

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,720
fixing. It doesn't need to give me

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
anything. It doesn't need to have a

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,200
reason for it. But because things are

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
not the way they should be and I have

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
the ability to make a positive influence

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,959
with them, I should do it. And think

88
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,879
about it. If everybody thought this way

89
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,800
and pay it forward without even needing

90
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,480
to get anything, our world will look

91
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,200
such a better place. Every single day I

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,519
do things that help other people improve

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,599
their lives, improve their health and

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
well-being. Some of these uh really

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,920
important lessons that I've learned. Uh

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,920
first and foremost was traveling,

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,760
traveling around the world. So I I I

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,840
love travel. I love meeting people all

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,159
over the world. I made it a point to

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,239
meet people where they are and go and

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,120
stay where they stay, eat where they

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,599
eat, travel how they travel, volunteer

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
as much as I could. And when I did that,

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,439
I learned a lot from them and that

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,280
helped shape me as an entrepreneur

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,720
because when you build solutions that

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,560
are global solution, you need to

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
understand the world. And understanding

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
the world is not enough to just do

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,360
internet research. I believe you need to

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,439
meet the people and need to see them

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,159
where they are. Understand all people

113
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,479
are people and and all humans are very

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,239
much similar but they have nuances and

115
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,000
if you understand these nuances and you

116
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,479
understand different approach approaches

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,520
to solving problems it creates for you a

118
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,120
toolkit that is a lot richer when you

119
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,479
tackle some of these challenges to not

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,320
just look at it the way all of us look

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,120
at a certain thing but find different

122
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,040
angles that may be more applicable for

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
particular challenges than the tools

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,720
that you have in your regular toolkit.

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,360
So one uh was definitely travel and and

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,960
and I recommend uh people to do that and

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,960
particularly meet a lot of people doing

128
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,960
that

129
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,689
[Music]

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,680
being in the valley in a time that was

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,000
you know post the the dot crash actually

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,400
when most people left here and just a

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,919
handful of people uh remained that were

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,360
very very passionate about building

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
businesses. And and some of these people

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
that were very very early in their

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,120
career back then are some of the most

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,360
successful entrepreneurs of our time

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
today. But the people who really stayed

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
here stayed because they were passionate

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,560
about building things that actually make

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,199
a difference and change the world. and

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
having long conversations with them, you

144
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,080
know, early early in their career about

145
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,520
how they think about building companies,

146
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
how they think about building teams uh

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
very early uh in the TED community for

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,759
example uh the the TED conference before

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,039
there was even TED X before there were

150
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
like a million conferences before there

151
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
was even a website I used to go to to

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
Mterrey it was like we used to go a

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,400
bunch of people from Silicon Valley uh

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,240
to to Monterey every year and and it was

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,840
a small handful of people that got It

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
was all the people that started the most

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,880
successful companies that you know in

158
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
the world right now. It was back then.

159
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,479
And we, you know, we would go and hear

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
some talks and then at night we'd spend

161
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,039
until 2, three or 4:00 in the morning

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,039
just hanging out, chatting, talking

163
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,880
about our challenges, you know, figuring

164
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,759
out what to do. And I think that was

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,680
amazingly amazingly important in shaping

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
how all of us thought about doing

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
certain things. Just interacting with

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
one another, working with some of them

169
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
that were more accomplished and already

170
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
had, you know, some success. Some of

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
them it was their first time of doing

172
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,440
this but it doesn't matter. The the

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,600
sharing was very important. So we did

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,080
that at TED. We did it in the early days

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,720
of South by Southwest when it was mostly

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,120
a music festival that was a tiny little

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
interactive section to it. There was a

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,160
couple hundred people or whatever the

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
number was back then. And the same thing

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
we used to go there every year and and

181
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,560
just hang out with each other and and

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,560
chat about it.

184
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,919
I I really want to say before I start

186
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,520
talking about that Silicon Valley I

187
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,240
really want to say that this is this is

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,919
not a community this is a movement I

189
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
mean seriously I want to give a huge

190
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,840
hand to Lara and Salomi like from

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,160
everyone like it's it's just

192
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,280
it's unbelievable it's so powerful We're

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
talking about collaboration. We're

194
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,039
talking about what we how can we

195
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,880
leverage the learning that everyone here

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,039
has achieved by putting together these

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,120
amazing events in universities, in

198
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,880
cities and everything and exchange this

199
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
information, share it together and

200
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,800
talking with Lara about trying to create

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
a platform that will make it very easy

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
to disseminate this information on an

203
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,680
ongoing basis. You know, you all put

204
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,160
together programs, you all put together

205
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
some software or something that helped

206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,880
you make a better event. And I I felt

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,800
putting together TEDx Silicon Valley

208
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,400
that if we could tap into some of that

209
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
or if we can share what we've created

210
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,680
with everyone else, it would be

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,680
amazingly powerful. So this is something

212
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,319
that uh I'm very excited to help doing

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,800
going forward. Uh and and it's really

214
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,360
really uh important to get together in

215
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,000
these gatherings, right, that are

216
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,759
smaller gatherings with people who are

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
experiencing the same thing that you're

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,560
experiencing and share authentically

219
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
what you're going through in these long

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,199
midnight, you know, conversations, but

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,039
also absorb a lot of uh how they're

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,919
solving thing and get inspired by that.

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,919
So that was really awesome.

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Entrepreneurship

225
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
is all about the people. It's all about

226
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,360
you are going to be only as successful

227
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,599
as the people around you. And it's very

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
important to choose the people that you

229
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,560
don't only think they're the best in

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
doing what they need to do. And that's

231
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,800
very important as a foundation. Choose

232
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,279
people who have the right skill and

233
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,680
right kind of level of experience to do

234
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,080
what they need to do. but also make sure

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,399
that they have the kind of energy right

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,040
and the stamina and the kind of

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
resilience that is required in order to

238
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,200
solve entrepreneurial challenges.

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,760
Sometimes uh you know I I chose people

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,160
who who actually were great and smart

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,720
and capable and had great resumes but

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,519
you know they did not have this kind of

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,279
dynamic and or this kind of character

244
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,440
that would take them through a lot of

245
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
ups and downs which entrepreneurship is

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
has inevitable huge amount of these

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
things. So think about how to bring

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
people, communicate to them. Don't

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
overcommunicate to them something that

250
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,200
like, oh yes, we're going to everything

251
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
is going to be great. We're going to

252
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
build a huge company. We're going to

253
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
change the world. That's great. Get them

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
inspired, but also be truthful to them.

255
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,680
Hey, this journey is going to have ups

256
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,360
and downs. There will be some tough

257
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,200
days. You need to think about that. And

258
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
here's what's coming up next. Make sure

259
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,680
that they are the right people. Also,

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
what's important is that they gel with

261
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,399
each other really well. Choose the right

262
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,800
kind of characters that get along with

263
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,720
each other well, that play well in a

264
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
team, right? Unless they're a personal

265
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
contributor that really wants to needs

266
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,279
to do one very particular thing and

267
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
they're excellent at it and doesn't

268
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,640
require collaboration. That's rare, but

269
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
that's sometimes important in things

270
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,560
that you're building. The majority of

271
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,440
people work with each other and teamwork

272
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,800
does make the dream work, right? So you

273
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
need to figure out how to choose people

274
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,560
that get not only are great people and

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,600
are social, but they get along with each

276
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,440
other really really well, right? And and

277
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,480
so that's that's a very very important

278
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,560
thing. And eventually people that really

279
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
resonate with the mission. I learned in

280
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,959
my life that it's important to have

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
missionaries and not mercenaries. Right?

282
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,920
There's some people who are really good

283
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
in what they're doing, but they're just

284
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
there for the paycheck and they do what

285
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,680
they need to do and they're done. Right?

286
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,519
I think the best way to identify if

287
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,519
somebody truly uh buys into a mission is

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
to have a deep conversation with them

289
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,480
that is situational. Don't just ask them

290
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,399
to talk in generalities about uh the

291
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
mission itself. Like it's everybody can

292
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
say, "Oh yeah, yeah, I really want to

293
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,760
help hundreds of millions or billions of

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
people live a healthier life." I mean

295
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,079
that's a very easy sentence to practice

296
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,399
at home in a job interview and and then

297
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
you know site it back. The best way to

298
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,880
tackle this is to ask them how they

299
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,120
practiced this uh this kind of mission,

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,200
this kind of uh world, this kind of

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,640
living, this kind of philosophy in their

302
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,800
own life in the past, right? So, so to

303
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,120
give you examples, right, of why they

304
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,880
actually resonate with that mission or

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
how they resonate with that mission, but

306
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,560
things that they did, not just things

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
that they're thinking about, right?

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,519
Right? And even if it's small things,

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
you know, some people want to help a

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
billion people and it's, you know, it's

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
it's daunting for them to even think

312
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
about it because they're early in their

313
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
career. So what how do you know because

314
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,640
they're early in their career? But

315
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
people who really care about these

316
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,000
things do things in their lives that

317
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,920
actually show that they are very very

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,079
interested in the mission. So look for

319
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,079
the doers, not just the thinkers.

320
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,760
So every everything that's worth doing

321
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,920
is challenging in my mind, right? I

322
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,800
think that there is a point in life in

323
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,959
which you just embrace challenge, right?

324
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,519
And and one thing that I learned over

325
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,519
the years and I practice right now is,

326
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,279
you know, I don't get too worked up when

327
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
things are uh challenging and I don't

328
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,160
get too excited when things are great,

329
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,600
right? I try to just accept the fact

330
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,079
that there's beauty in what we define as

331
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,920
good and pleasurable and nice and and

332
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,800
and you know fulfilling but there's also

333
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,519
beauty in things that are challenging

334
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,800
actually sometime make people sad. I

335
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
know that sounds a little bit

336
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,880
controversial but when you understand

337
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,040
that the life is the circular approach

338
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,760
and the whole approach of everything

339
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,160
that's happening to us good and bad and

340
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,639
and when you stop judging them when you

341
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,320
start stop trying to just go to only

342
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,880
figure out how to make things good and

343
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,040
try to avoid the bad because the bad

344
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,000
what we consider as bad or less

345
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,959
favorable will happen. Not strive to

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,800
make it happen but accept it. they say,

347
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
you know, it's going to be there. It's

348
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,720
fine. And it's it's it's something that

349
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
is part of life and we celebrate it. We

350
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,800
celebrate the good. We celebrate the not

351
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,320
so good. It makes us stronger. And I

352
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
think that the advice that I give

353
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
everybody is to try to get to that place

354
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,000
at least once a day. And then once you

355
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,720
figure out where it is to start applying

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
it here and there so you can go back to

357
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
this clean slate cuz you're going to

358
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
make better decisions, you're going to

359
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,760
feel better with yourself and you're

360
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,760
going to have a better, happier life.
