with questions

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,479
I think I should take a break from

43
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,420
pulling stuff up in car videos

44
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,619
opinions on camera every time what is

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,540
this dude like

46
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,979
he's doing his job I know but he's like

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,020
it looked at the back of our car like

48
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,740
extra dirty or something I'll leave him

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,479
alone

50
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,560

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,720
this dude with your life because you're

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
talking down on them well I speak behind

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,159
his back like I defend people behind

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,880
their back that's the type of guy I am

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,099
lifestyle getting out of control

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,479

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,000

115
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,139
like three houses with a pool in the

116
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,699
middle like that connects with all three

117
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,220

118
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,720
someone can have corn holes we just

119
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,639

121
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,100
neighbor

122
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,540
and there's doors from like each other

123
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,699
okay we're gonna keep looking Boom Bang

124
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,199
Pow pool in the middle ping pong table

126
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,699
Bridges going to the other house bridges

are cool but we need like over there

128
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,520
over the pool

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,860

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,600
bridge over our pool so I can walk to

131
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,220

done everything

162
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,979
I remember when he yelled at one of the

163
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,780
Power Rangers and he said one of the

164
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,919
taglines in like the show when he yelled

165
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,160
at one of the Power Rangers was you

166
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,360
snooze you you snooze you lose correct

167
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,220
you're not paying attention and he was

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,419
giving all the kids his zoos we talking

169
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,300
because then they'd go back to their

170
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,280
parents and no the parents if the

171
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,039
parents touch the Ooze they became like

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,560
they became enslaved to the to the Ooze

173
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,080
yes and then he made two big bugs out of

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,720
ooze Curry took on the city let them

175
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,199
[ __ ] Power Ranger Megazords correct

178
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,240

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,460

any Cravings right now like what do you

194
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:24,380
think a soft pretzel with a oh

195
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,380
boy with cheese

196
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,319
cake yeah it can stay on the counter

197
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,460
Charo from Costco what's your least

198
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,560
favorite word and why tug

199
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,419
tug I'd say my least favorite word is

200
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,380
like

201
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,699
strawberry ooh unpopular they're so

202
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,979
popular

203
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,599
and just strawberry like I think of two

204
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,620
totally different things like I think of

205
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,940
a straw and then a berry every time

206
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,440
I've never thought of it like that until

207
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,000
you just pointed it every single time

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,979
someone's like oh strawberry I just

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,319
think of both items like a straw then a

210
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,880
berry well what's the berry and you

211
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,360
think of like a straw than blueberries

212
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,400
correct

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,139
very weird you're very weird sorry like

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,639
what if you did this song isn't that

215
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,560
weird like I think of something like

216
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,660
that and it's just like

217
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,460
like no one else is actually thinking

218
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,199
that like I thought that was a normal

219
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,419
thing to think of like a straw than a

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,099
berry no but no one you guys both just

221
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,840
said well like I mean I can see it but

222
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,240
like but it's not weird like if I said

223
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,500
like uh like uh like uh something you

224
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,720
could think of something that isn't even

225
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,159
how normal people like most other people

226
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
are thinking you're just thinking it

227
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,060
like that

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,459
okay like like when I said strawberry

229
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,200
when I say strawberries because I I see

230
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,700
a straw than a berry and you guys like

231
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,779
oh I've never seen like that I bet you

232
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,399
there's probably like a few people that

233
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,839
relate to my side that always think of

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
like a straw and a berry and there's

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,220
people that are like you guys I'm like I

236
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,320
never think I'm strong in a berry

237
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,480
wait if I said firecracker right now

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,580
like I I used to when I was little think

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,680
of like fire and then like a cracker

240
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,500
like a Saltine

241
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,540
no one else does that

242
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,800
what it's like like when it's like two

243
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,320
different things like a strawberry

244
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,540
firecracker growing up I used to think

245
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,580
of yeah I gotta understand that because

246
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,740
you're Gap pineapple

247
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,140
no because that's like two different

248
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,000
like I can understand

249
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,680
when you say Pine you don't buy a truck

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,180
yes when I was little I used to think of

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,740
like a fire and then like a truck like

252
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,560
that like I think their problem is

253
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,040
you're gapping the words out too much

254
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,140
when I was little now

255
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,399
like when you say fire truck and I think

256
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,380
of like a fire truck like a fire engine

257
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,399
but when I was little I used to so it

258
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,740
just took you a while to get used to

259
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,220
what about like apple sauce

260
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,180
oh cause what sauce Matt yeah but what's

261
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,100
berry

262
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,420
like if you're saying this is a

263
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,620
strawberry but if you do the same thing

264
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,760
to blueberries that you did the

265
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,440
strawberries strawberries and

266
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,700
firecrackers were both huge for me like

267
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,440
those were the two where I'd always

268
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,120
think of like the words separate I don't

269
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,620
know why what was even the question I

270
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,680
thought that was a word you don't like

271
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,560
oh that's not I feel like that had to be

272
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,720
like another thing for someone else

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm feeling like what's a word I dislike

274
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,980
I don't know whatever

275
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,140
oh well one of my biggest fears That's

276
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,519
So Random and weird what is one of your

277
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,500
biggest fears That's So Random and weird

278
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,660
don't talk to me like that don't talk

279
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,760
like that man I'm thinking like like the

280
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,320
like foggy mirrors like mirrors that

281
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
they like make to look like vintagey or

282
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,800
old or like really antiqueish mirrors

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,300
that aren't like Crystal Clear they're

284
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,779
like I don't think they make them like

285
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,920
that like fox

286
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,380
or like some things that are like silver

287
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,240
so they're like Reflections but it's not

288
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,740
like a mirror like I get really freaked

289
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,080
out by things that aren't like partial

290
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,640
reflection like just foggy Reflections

291
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,440
like oh I hate it like a window

292
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,500
reflecting you

293
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:48,779
in the in the night sky kinda

294
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,640
a curb oh good one I hate that curb curb

295
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,339
curve sounds like a weird why why isn't

296
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,500
it like Uncle curbs here like that is

297
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,560
true I should have never thought that

298
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,140
was a crazy thought

299
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,420
listen poor design listen listening how

300
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,459
much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a

301
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,860
woodchuck could chuck wood I feel like a

302
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:10,440
woodchuck doesn't even chuck wood and I

303
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,140
for I feel like that's a good question

304
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,079
is it a woodchuck and Otter

305
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,880

307
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,360
animal I can't agree with you I'm

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,680
thinking it's just water are they are

309
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,300
they no because now it's in something

310
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,339
odd one I don't think can you sit the

311
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,720
[ __ ] down sorry I'm like the the seat

316
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,300

some like 10 wood shock at the facts

328
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,899
okay like don't you agree like let's not

329
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,980
like if I wanted to know about a rat I

330
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,899
wouldn't just compare it to like a

331
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,899
dandelion I'd just like look up a rat

332
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,000

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,880
facts about a woodchuck let me just go

335
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,899
compare it to an otter like what let's

336
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,980
well that's reasonable because that's

337
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,560
what we're debating okay that's a

338
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,440
woodchuck yep okay now go back give me

339
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,860
ten like I want to know where region

340
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,860
like climate they like like to live in

341
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,899
what they eat like why is it called a

342
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,519
woodchuck like do they chuck wood or are

343
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,500
they like a wood Harvester like what's

344
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,360
their Source in this ecosystem like I

345
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,920
want to know like five solid facts about

346
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,959
a woodchuck what's this gonna do for you

347
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,339
are you gonna like I sleep better do

348
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,899
that well because I don't believe a

349
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,700
woodchuck actually Chuck's wood that's

350
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,440
why make a [ __ ] inside it's like even

351
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,019
the little Pun It's like what how much

352
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,079
wood would a woodchuck chuck

353
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,760
if a woodchuck could chuck wood so it

354
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,740
technically is saying he can't chug wood

355
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,420
because how much wood he chuck if you if

356
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,680
he would

357
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,720
I feel like

358
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,680
have wood

359
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,880
the woodchuck chuck if a wood chuck

360
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,740
could chuck wood this is such a giant

361
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,000
wooden chuck wood so it's implying right

362
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,380
now it does no wood chucking correct

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,380
Zero woodchucking from the woodchucker

364
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,660
but if it could how much wood would it

365
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,279
Chuck exactly I'm getting you but so

366
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,320
that's why I wanted to know the facts of

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,860
like so let's see why is it called the

368
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,899
woodchuck do wood Chucks what's the

369
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,760
question like why are you so flustered

370
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,959
by it do woodchucks chuck I hear you I

371
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,519
just think maybe do like a school

372
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,440
project on it and then come back yeah

373
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,959
let me just go back to you well a New

374
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,600
York state wildlife expert Richard New

375
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:51,899
York Richard Thomas decided to answer

376
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,300
that question some years back he found

377
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:58,320
that while a woodchuck doesn't actually

378
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,019
chuck wood they do in fact quite

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,240
a bit of dirt when digging out a burrow

380
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,240
so they burrow on a good day they can

381
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,660
Chuck around 35 cubic feet of dirt but

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,860
never would so who called it wood it's

383
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,860
dirt it's a dirt truck

384
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,019
how's it mean you rather Chuck dirt than

385
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,240
wood I feel like a dirt truck's just a

386
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,740
rude name

387
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,300
what Chuck sounds inviting and nice like

388
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,620
it's a woodchuck like we all know and

389
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,120
love the woods would you look a

390
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,519
woodchuck straight in his eyes and call

391
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,079
him a dirt truck absolutely have to note

392
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,459
how much he can chuck in a day

393
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,820
absolutely I feel like that's the

394
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,820
equivalent

395
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:44,040
apparently 35 cubic inches I feel like

396
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,320
that's really me that's like going out

397
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,160
to someone with like glasses me like

398
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,160
except for eyes

399
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,040
it's like saying what's up glasses like

400
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,260
it's like you're just implying what it

401
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
they actually do no it's a you're a dark

402
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,560
chocolate

403
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,139
imagine like what other animals what's

404
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,880
up YouTuber what like I heard that I

405
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,160
hate it yeah it's like a little awkward

406
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,940
but like you know but Chris my thing is

407
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,940
like if

408
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,600
hold on what other animals are like

409
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,459
around the woods I think we gotta

410
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,720
reverse because listen you're a YouTuber

411
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,220
right if someone was like Hey Matt

412
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,920
you're a tick talker you're gonna be

413
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,180
like no I'm a YouTuber so now you're

414
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,480
going to the woodchuck and you're like

415
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,980
oh you're a woodchucker

416
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,839
correct so we just actually broke it

417
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,660
down and it wants to be the dirt chucker

418
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,920
that's what he really does and we went

419
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,720
we just went and gave him the name of a

420
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,480
woodchucker

421
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,160
that's upsetting exactly so I really

422
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,519
just really put on for the woodchucks

423
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,320
because now they're like the dirt Chucks

424
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,880
correct but also I feel like if you if

425
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,740
we didn't clarify it like that what I

426
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,120
was saying was like what other animals

427
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,019
live near like a woodchuck and they

428
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,139
would probably go outside and be like

429
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,160
what's up dirt shock like oh yeah like a

430
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,820
squirrel like what are you doing over

431
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,800
there chucking dirt dirt Chuck like

432
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,420
oh I feel so bad I just picture like a

433
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,860
woodchuck I think squirrels are just so

434
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,779
squirrely though you'd be a wood chuck

435
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,100
if you're an animal a dirt truck a dirt

436
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,240
truck these squirrels are just so

437
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,980
squirrely

438
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,160
squirrel makes so much sense to be

439
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,660
called a squirrel same with the stingray

440
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,079
and I look at the stigma I'm like yes

441
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,079
you are

442
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,019
next question

443
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,079

444
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,079
