good thank you guys this my journey has

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,320
been from the UK all the way through San

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,920
Francisco we're very grateful for the

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,159
opportunity that that's that's come to

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,400
us we're buzzed about this hi we're

30
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,360
humble works I'm here to tell you about

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,560
a problem that is costing the world

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
around a trillion pounds my background

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,320
is in sustainable design and renewable

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,479
energy to help with this crisis I pulled

35
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,439
together the team that I thought would

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,320
be best fit to solve this there are

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,119
1.3 billion information workers around

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,960
the globe that are sitting at their

39
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,680
laptops hunched over as they're working

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,159
remotely we're going to focus on 145

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,439
million remote employees that are in the

42
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,920
UK the EU and the US 88% of managers

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
don't believe their remote work teams

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,759
are working as productively as they

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
could be here's how we solve this

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,240
problem by moving during the course of

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,479
the workday we can unlock 17% more

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,840
productivity and drop sick days by 25%

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,119
how do you move during the workday and

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,000
stay productive we've built an ecosystem

51
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,960
an Adaptive ecosystem fully sustainable

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,680
sophisticated feels right at home or

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,080
works at the office that allows you to

54
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,599
move from position to position and stay

55
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,480
productive it's all well and good as

56
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,120
promising managers CEOs the 177%

57
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,560
Improvement in productivity can we prove

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,440
that yes we can 17% Improvement in

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,879
productivity is captured by and measured

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,280
using the humble Works app our goal for

61
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,239
move to measure is to then create a

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,599
report the reports going to be buffered

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
and anonymized so individualized data

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,280
isn't available but will be presented to

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,920
a manager who then understands where the

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,680
information or the work gaps are between

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,200
him and his Workforce and at some point

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,360
over the next year all goes to well all

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,760
goes to plan we plan to create an AI

70
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,640
manager to supplement and to possibly

71
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,800
replace managers in some cases to have

72
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,200
entire teams being managed through an AI

73
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,000
dashboard and our Revenue model is to

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,400
charge

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,440
£119 per employee in year one employees

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,959
will get the full humble work Suite full

77
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,959
humble Works Suite includes the standing

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,120
desk the workstation the Rochester and

79
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,680
humble Works app to help you track

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,519
movement as you progress from one point

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,760
to the next year two will be the manager

82
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,400
report that's now going to show you the

83
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,680
granular data that we've gathered

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,879
gathered in year one and give you live

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,440
real-time feedback on how you're working

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,040
and optimize your entire workday by year

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,159
three we'll have the app the manager

88
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,200
dashboard and environment scan used

89
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,959
through the existing camera on your on

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,040
your laptop by year three we're planning

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,200
to take on the insurance industry it's a

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,319
fragmented industry that needs work with

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,200
our granular data that we've gathered

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,360
and the root cause of the health issue

95
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,840
being sitting down all day leading to

96
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,680
all of the other issues will teach us

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,000
exactly where those Health preventative

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,079
indicators will come from this is the

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
saving in year one compared to what

100
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,920
people usually spend right now per

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,040
employee right we will save employees

102
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,599
employers 1,400 year 1 1,680 year 2 and

103
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,760
2,600 year 3 here's how we'll do that

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,040
they're currently suspending around

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,040
£750 per employee in health insurance

106
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,320
loss in productivity and loss in sick

107
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,759
days are all the mitigating points that

108
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,840
we're going to bring to the market and

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,759
Save in in all of those costs across the

110
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,800
board can we do this can we pull this

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,800
off with just the standing desk alone we

112
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,560
generated a million in sales at the end

113
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,639
of 2023 just the standing desk by itself

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,520
and at that point we pivoted and decided

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
movement was the bigger play at hand

116
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,600
thank you for your time really

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,120
appreciate it if you raise the money you

118
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,120
said2 million uh what are you going to

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,360
achieve and by when so in year one we'd

120
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,720
like to build the um AI manager

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,720
dashboard and the AI manager dashboard

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,039
would take the data from year one and

123
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,080
build an entire framework for how you

124
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,440
should be working and all of that data

125
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,360
is then going to be presented back to

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,680
you as a full breakdown of where where

127
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,240
you should be at the end of to we would

128
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,639
like to have the environment scan built

129
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,039
in well what I'm trying to figure out is

130
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,919
if I invest today will next round be

131
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,479
like a double or triple the price

132
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,680
otherwise there's no reason for me to

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,280
invest today right let's imagine you

134
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,880
invest today in two years from now the

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
data that we would have gathered from

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,120
movement that nobody else is gathering

137
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,880
from how people are working from home

138
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,919
will put us in a position where the

139
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,120
following round that we go for will be

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
5x what we're aiming for now just saying

141
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,919
collecting data will be enough to get 5x

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
the price that's to me like feels like a

143
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,160
really different business where it's

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,360
like okay let's spy on the SP spy on the

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,520
employees like make sure that they're

146
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,720
kind of like being productive and

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
working we have uh desks that move up

148
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,160
and down they are standing they don't

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,000
use what you say and yeah and I think

150
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,840
that well usually what typically happens

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,800
is that uh you know we got the ones that

152
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,319
have the the memory and everything like

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,720
that you can just push a button it

154
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,080
immediately go to the next setting

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,240
pretty much every single person they

156
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,280
either keep it up or they keep it down

157
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,960
they're not moving it up and down you

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,639
know all all the time I mean this kind

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,520
of gets the other part of the problem

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,680
which is like well like you're trying to

161
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,520
change people's behavior yeah right and

162
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,720
like it's going to be like oh and then

163
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,280
you know how do you do it in another way

164
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,680
that it's going to be like that it's

165
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,000
going to be accepted by the by the users

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
they going to be like you know is it

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,319
like the nag screen that's going to come

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,880
up and say like hey it's time for you to

169
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,599
to to get up and walk around or is it

170
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,880
like hey I mean because I think it would

171
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,759
be if you just give hey I have the

172
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,800
options of like putting my desk up or

173
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,680
down I have options of putting it my

174
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
laptop on know higher or lower uh I mean

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
the the stuff that I've seen is that

176
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
people I mean often people aren't aren't

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,800
doing that which is I mean it's part of

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,759
the root of the problem where it's like

179
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,160
okay people have bad posture because

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
they don't even realize like like

181
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,720
necessarily they have they have this bad

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,919
posture but then also like you don't you

183
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,520
don't um you know it's challenging to be

184
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,599
like the kind of Nag wear whatever

185
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,280
that's going to be like oh well well the

186
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,560
camera shows that you're slouching why

187
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,240
like why why why don't you set up

188
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,919
straight stuff so what what are what are

189
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,800
your thoughts there brilliant question

190
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,160
and I'm glad you all in fact the um the

191
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
house we were kind of uh joining and and

192
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,039
we're staying with um have a hack house

193
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,280
and they have standing desks we have we

194
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
all have standing desks we don't use

195
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,199
them and in fact I'm I'm going to say

196
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,680
something that's that's probably going

197
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,400
to sound controversial but standing

198
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,440
isn't the answer to go from sitting to

199
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,120
just standing it's recently been proven

200
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,680
that you'll burn a few more calories but

201
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,680
it's not solving the problem which is

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,599
why we pivoted in 2023 towards movement

203
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,800
and towards creating behavioral change

204
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,360
by benchmarking using the humble Works

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,680
app once you understand where you are in

206
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
context of a leaderboard cuz that that

207
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,280
will be part of the next step and how

208
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,599
you've performed the metrics that you're

209
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,759
now playing with or the switches you're

210
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,199
now turning up and down are going to be

211
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,680
or the ones that are uh available to you

212
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,800
is mood move and productivity so what

213
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,720
our goal is is to show you over a period

214
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,120
of time as a baseline here's where you

215
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,039
are and after a few weeks it takes 21

216
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,319
days and so what's the time period I

217
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,080
mean like in terms of like hey I

218
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,919
implement this like at what point am

219
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,759
going to see the ROI our goal is to go

220
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,759
into a company and to propose a 25% roll

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,560
out to their work from home stuff right

222
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,639
to find the teams that would be

223
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,120
reluctant resistant or the teams that

224
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,879
would jump on and say yeah I'm I'm up

225
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,800
for this the early the early adopters

226
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,440
all the way through the ones that can to

227
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,400
be relaxant right and the app is going

228
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,440
to set a baseline over three weeks it's

229
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,960
going to set a Baseline and the the

230
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,879
Baseline for that app would be here's

231
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,560
where we are before the humble work

232
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,240
suite comes in and allows us to move

233
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,599
from position to position here's me

234
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,879
sitting down hunched over my laptop like

235
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,000
everyone else in those 1.3 billion

236
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,120
information workers right

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,039
and then three weeks later we introduced

238
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,959
The Humble work Suite from that point on

239
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,240
with within three months our goal is to

240
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,919
show productivity Spike whether it's a

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,959
few perc or goes all the way up to what

242
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,240
we're promising at 17% there's going to

243
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,279
be a marked difference in productivity

244
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,160
so maybe we could talk about like what

245
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,279
the current status is you know how many

246
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,399
units are deployed how much data are you

247
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,519
getting per month right now all that

248
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,440
we've just completed the the the full

249
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,800
build so the entire humble works is

250
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,800
bootstrapped so built it from scratch

251
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,800
and at the end of 2023 I pivoted away

252
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,920
from just selling standing desks by

253
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,160
themselves we focus on building the tech

254
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,720
building the full suite and use the uh

255
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,079
so you're right now in the process of

256
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,399
getting the data and all that right now

257
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:18,360
absolutely so right now in the process

258
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,839
of Market penetration and and and and

259
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,399
adops to encourage movement uh many of

260
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,240
our some of the meetings are we just

261
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,360
walking meetings we just walk around the

262
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,800
block so that that's why I'm not sure

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,839
this you know app or chair will would

264
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,640
make a difference no of course see see

265
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,600
imagine this as this point where

266
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,240
nobody's done this before up until this

267
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,079
point everyone's very easily said I'll

268
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,519
spend £3,000 on a an expensive ergonomic

269
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,200
chair that'll go up back will go in and

270
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,160
that's it and nobody's really embraced

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,000
this idea of what if we change this the

272
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,000
the entire status quo if we change the

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
dynamic and we we built this homogeneous

274
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,120
way of working where all of my employees

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,839
are now working in the same way if I set

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,079
up an office I wouldn't allocate and

277
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,360
just throw a budget out and say right

278
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,600
you can have a sofa if you'd like you

279
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
can have this sort of chair you more

280
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,560
than the office would be fair sterile

281
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,519
and look quite homogeneous with a

282
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,519
similar setup along the way thank you I

283
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,839
appreciate it I think today's Q&A helped

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,040
me understand the gaps um the linear

285
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,880
storytelling and um the presentation of

286
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,360
the pitch that can then mitigate the

287
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,839
gaps you would get towards the the Q&A I

288
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,560
feel like I answer the Q&A as best as I

289
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,600
could uh but possibly having more uh

290
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,079
tangible and statistical U evidence at

291
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,040
the Q&A would have helped because it's

292
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:38,519
almost like you have your appendix ready

293
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,240
and your appendix could then validate

294
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,600
the rest of the the questions there and

295
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,000
then so possibly having an appendix and

296
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,079
helping shape the framing the pitch in

297
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,519
in a structured order that would help

298
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:56,279
the dot te is is just this absolute uh

299
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,680
logical next step to have um a um an

300
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,680
easy way for people to understand it's

301
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,839
not a standing Des company anymore it's

302
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,279
now a technology company and this is

303
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,519
where we're going and dotech shortcuts

304
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,240
that process or I imagine hopefully

305
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,639
shortcuts that process are people going

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,560
oh that's humble Works they do standing

307
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,600
desks no they humble works. Tech and

308
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,079
they must have a tech site to this what

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,040
is that tech oh there's an app and now

310
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,480
there's a manager report and now there's

311
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,839
uh AI bills into it I found that uh uh

312
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,600
the quantitative uh benefit

313
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,959
to be a little questionable what I mean

314
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,639
by that is uh uh um his product is just

315
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,519
starting to get deployed right now and

316
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,440
as a result he doesn't have a lot of

317
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,519
data back yet and so he can't say

318
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,519
because of his product we get these

319
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,240
benefits instead what he's saying is is

320
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,360
that uh if you do these kind of things

321
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,639
like more Mobility you get these

322
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,600
benefits and the product can do these

323
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,440
things and therefore the product product

324
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,440
will be able to provide and so I I see

325
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,120
logically what he's trying to do and and

326
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,560
if I him I would try to sell too when it

327
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,680
comes to presentation I thought humble

328
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,920
Works was by far the best presenter

329
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,920
right that doesn't sound like an AI

330
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,760
recommendation no that I mean like that

331
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,440
because they was they called us because

332
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,199
they called me that like your system is

333
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
crazy customers don't like Dynamic

334
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,000
pricing because it's like wait a second

335
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,279
oh you got you got a different price

336
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,959
than I got when I like when I went you

337
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,519
know went went to for this or like it's

338
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,560
you know there's a lot of backlash

339
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,440
around surge pricing and like these

340
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,440
these sorts of things which ultimately

341
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
ends up getting a brand risk

342
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,720
