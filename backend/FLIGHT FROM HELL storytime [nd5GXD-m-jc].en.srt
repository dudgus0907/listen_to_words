00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,079
if you guys it's not a normal it's not a

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,980
normal day

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,980
it's today

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,399
and today is a gift

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
um

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,600
so if you guys are unaware and our last

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,100
Wednesday video that we just posted

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
um Matt and Christopher in Chicago I was

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,820
in LA for like five days without them

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,559
and then like when I came home it was

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,960
like the longest we had been apart and

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
with that I flew alone on a plane for

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,199
the first time and I have a couple

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,640
stories that I didn't tell Matt and

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,700
Chris yet of like things that happened

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,680
to me and honest to God I think that

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,600
[ __ ] this crazy happens to me and Matt

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,340
and Chris all the time but they felt so

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,560
much more surreal because I was alone

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,720
with my thoughts so I was like there's

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
no one for me to talk about you there's

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
no one for me to talk to and I'll never

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
like that so I'm like I was just really

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,159
like scoping out what was happening

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,159
around me because so next because I was

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,200
alone but no multiple stories

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,420
so you know when like you scan your

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,700
ticket for like the plane and it like

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,140
beeps bright red if you're in an exit

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,180
row yeah and they're like oh are you

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,240
willing and able to help in case of an

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,740
emergency due to like a [ __ ] plane

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,659
crashing and you're supposed to say yes

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,280
I'm willing and able and that's all they

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,020
need like they're never gonna get in a

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,520
plane crash but you just have to say

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,280
like oh I'm willing and able like you

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,799
have to say yes yeah well they're like

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,280
any handicapped Personnel can board the

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,500
plane first and this [ __ ] crutches up

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,180
there the slowest I've ever seen anyone

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,280
on crutches ever like I'm talking like

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,140
I've seen people on crutches and be kind

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,380
of mobile with it like moving at a

56
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,819
decent pace this [ __ ] crunched like if

57
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,819
she didn't have those crutches she was

58
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,500
getting nowhere I kid you not okay she

59
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,000
gets to the front scancer thing beeps

60
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,400
bright red of course and the lady's like

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,340
are you willing and able to help in case

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,080
of an emergency and I'm like why did you

63
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,540
even ask the goddamn question first of

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,840
all she may be willing but she is far

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,340
far the [ __ ] away from Abel like if she

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,739
says

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,780
there is concrete proof in front of my

68
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,520
eyes denying this like you are not able

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,940
girl at all

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,920
um but gladly she says no I said correct

71
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,360
it's like absolutely imagine though

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,360
she's like yeah I'm willing enable it's

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,280
like girl there's proof in front of my

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,120
eyes that you are not oh my God but she

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,040
was

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
dude I was just a little in shock

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,000
because I'm like of course why are you

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,860
so high up I'm like looking fixing my

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,660
posture recently but I was just like in

80
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,760
shots I'm like if this girl says like oh

81
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,440
yeah I'm really enable you are far from

82
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,700
the truth okay and of course they put

83
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,140
the girl in crunch it like obviously

84
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,340
they don't know but it's like how ironic

85
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,440
for the girl would crutches well she

86
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,599
booked her own ticket yeah but she

87
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,640
probably broke her leg after

88
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,540
what are the odds of that um but also

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,739
I've never seen someone when they're

90
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,840
like oh are you willing and able to not

91
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,760
say yes and the funny thing too oh my

92
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,040
God I forgot the guy before her was like

93
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,319
absolutely like he was like acting like

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
a soldier like getting ready for War I

95
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,060
was like buddy this is a [ __ ]

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,239
in case scenario you're probably gonna

97
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,200
sit there lounging eating peanuts

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,819
speaking of I just perfectly

99
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,319
transitioned into my next thought and I

100
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,480
didn't even mean to do it

101
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,560
we're we're on the plane

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,180
I can't we're on this plane right okay

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,159
I didn't forget and I have as a bullet

104
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,780
point served peanuts question mark

105
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,819
question mark question mark because we

106
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,379
get on the plane and they do all the

107
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,540
normal procedure and like right before

108
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,560
we take off the intercom starts and I'm

109
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,900
like oh God they're gonna tell us the

110
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,519
engines are busted like we're done but

111
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,159
because it's like a random time Tuesday

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,140
okay but the lady goes oh I was just

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
informed that someone on this plane has

114
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,560
is a severe peanut allergies if you

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,299
brought any snacks on board that

116
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,819
contained peanuts tree nuts any kind of

117
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,680
nuts please refrain from eating any of

118
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,480
them and if you want a replacement for

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
your snack well absolutely like we have

120
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,840
a bunch but just please don't open any

121
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,840
peanuts and I was in first class

122
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,180
of course no I'm kidding we don't fly

123
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,360
first class often but I was alone and

124
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,800
scared so I was but I was in first class

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,880
and the guy comes up to me like 40

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
minutes into the flight and he's like

127
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,880
warm peanuts and hands me like a little

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,880
dish of peanuts I'm like

129
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,940
the line

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
like is someone under a life-threatening

131
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,259
circumstance in the background because

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
they said don't eat peanuts and they

133
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:52,320
bust they pull they they gave them out

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,940
that's crazy yeah anyways let's see if I

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,979
have another that is insane so they just

136
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,900
serve peanuts and everyone oh another

137
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,259
one I have written down two

138
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,600
[ __ ] with guitars okay they

139
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,280
have they're like oh we're extremely

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,840
limited on space like we cannot have

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,340
anyone put like anything other than one

142
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
carry on the overhead bin if you want to

143
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,259
check your bag out of a courtesy like we

144
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,780
can two [ __ ] with guitars as

145
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,580
their carry-on item

146
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,440
it let it happen like I know it's 2023

147
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,840
but guitars cannot bend and folds like

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
that [ __ ] was big yeah and they're like

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,259
trying to fit the guitars in the whole

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,940
time and this poor woman like they got

151
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,139
the guitars in and this poor woman had

152
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,539
to like check her suitcase because there

153
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,880
wasn't room I'm like have AC DC check

154
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,680
that because that's ridiculous like no

155
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,539
one should be bringing on a carry-on

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,039
item a guitar well I get it they're more

157
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,620
fragile but that's ridiculous when

158
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,740
you're pushing for space like that's

159
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,780
ridic

160
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:50,300
and then I got [ __ ] confusing

161
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,300
me by not by moving weird as [ __ ]

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,060
yeah we're good like I triple checked my

163
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,039
boarding pass I checked the app I'm like

164
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,440
I checked my flight number you know I'm

165
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,699
there and I'm like okay like these

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,220
people like they're probably going to

167
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,840
Boston you know that's where I'm going

168
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,759
so I'm looking at this one guy and then

169
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,460
this one family of five and they're like

170
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,720
my two staple people like because I I

171
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,639
saw them around I got to the gate I'm

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,979
like if they're here at the gate

173
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm good you know why because you

174
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,620
thought because I was like oh like if

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,820
they're here at the gate like I'm in the

176
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,319
right place because like they're getting

177
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,300
on this plane you know what I mean like

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,340
I won't end up in the right if I'm I'll

179
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,600
be in the wrong spot if both these

180
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,860
[ __ ] aren't here when I'm

181
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,220
getting on a plane okay yeah you know

182

211
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,099
and I'm like you know

212
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,259

213
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,000
those [ __ ] that could say no or

214
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,039
like was a bad person because the flight

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,840
attendant comes up to me gives me the

216
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,520
girl sob story and is like do you mind

217
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,300
like if you switch seats with her and

218
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680

class but her chair yeah she was also

222
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,400
first class her seat just wouldn't lay

223
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,960
down mine would lay down but the reason

224
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,880
he asked me is because I wasn't laying

225
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,460
down yet because my seatbelt sign was on

226
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,840
so I'm like there's no way like like I

227
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,840
didn't know I could go into laying

228

277
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:05,220
not lie all the way flat the problem was

278
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,860
it was positioned if I was a [ __ ]

279
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,080
contortionist like the back was arched

280
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,459

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,320
on the Frogger you know what I'm talking

282
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,540
about the ride that goes up and down I

283
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,600
feel like I was at Star blast at Canobie

284
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,120
Lake it was Unreal I was like what

285
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,279

286
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,320
they put me up like like I've never had

287
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,180
this happen to me because I'm I don't

288
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,800
have female genitalia but when you're

289
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,360
giving birth like your feet are up on

290
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,459
things that they can get a good look for

291
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,100
the delivery I felt like I was just up

292
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,180
in the air like

293
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,320
weirdest position I've ever been in in

294
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:43,380
my life for five [ __ ] hours

295
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,640
and then I tried to like lay it down and

296
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,500
the problem was that the things didn't

297
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
go flat it was just like stuck in that

298
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,800
position and then I'm like okay like

299
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,800
whatever RuPaul will get me through this

300
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,959
so I go I go to my TV show and it's like

301
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,820
oh not loading and then my Wi-Fi did not

302
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
work for the rest of the flights I'm

303
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,640
like what songs do I have downloaded

304
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,620
I'll just listen to my downloaded music

305
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,579
and try and sleep as if I'm [ __ ]

306
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,600
delivering a child and I hit Shuffle on

307
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:10,860

310
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,940
sitting there

311
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,459
in despair no music no TV stuck with my

312
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,019

00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,740

photos with me and Chris at summerslash

381
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,300

382
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,700
days to post them to keep it a surprise

383
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,399
from everyone that we were in Chicago

384
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,740

385
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,959
no clue we were there at all maybe like

386
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,300

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,260
was on the stage ever no one knew you

388
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300

390
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,720
the people like at summer smash already

391
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,060
that song yeah besides and then nobody

392
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,560
had any service so people saw that Chris

393
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,220
was there live but couldn't post

394
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,720

397
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,380
onenote's crazy also I just remember

398
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,380
from the airport

399
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,200
say it what the only Waters they sold

400
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,639
were in glass bottles at the stores I'm

401
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
like that could be turned into a weapon

402
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,899
very quickly it could

403
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,639
it was only option like why are we

404
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,959
having like let's like when you're on a

405
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
plane usually you want like minimal [ __ ]

406
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,680
that can fit all in your bag yeah

407
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,300
plastic water bottle it was like glass

408
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,500
Evian I'm like I don't know what you

409
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,899
think you're doing but it ain't that

410
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,540
better have a bank account if you want

411
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,820
to see what I'm about

412
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:57,000
I think I slept for a total of like six

413
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,000
hours the entire time I was in Chicago I

414
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,860
slept three and 48. I slept three hours

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,639
and 48 hours and then you're walking

416
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,760
around three hours in 40 years

417
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,180
sounds like a rap bar mmm it's only

418
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,180
Taylor Swift

419
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,160
red

420
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,740
bro I got a BLT and they threw a

421
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,740
jalapeno in the middle

422
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,019
[Laughter]

423
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,100
your eyes dude a BLT is one sandwich you

424
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,100
cannot [ __ ] up

425
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,420
the [ __ ] name BLT

426
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,800
J

427
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,240
it's your problem

428
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,220
like if you're adding she'll surprise

429
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
[ __ ] to a BLT at least add it to like

430
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,639
[ __ ] if you're gonna add surprise

431
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,000
ingredients to a meal it has to be like

432
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,260
Nachos Supreme mess disaster that's how

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,240
to be the title of the thing you order

434
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,459
because then you could throw [ __ ] cow

435
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,079
[ __ ] on it and I would expect that

436
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:58,079
that's part of it because the name is

437
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,920
like [ __ ] disaster tornado nachos but

438
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,920
BLT

439
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:09,959
but it was a blta with avocado as well

440
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,779
um no Jay yeah correct okay so that

441
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,579
changes nothing it makes it more clear

442
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,839
on what should not [ __ ] mean if

443
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:18,600
anything they should have just put the J

444
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,760
also what where's my respect for Mayo at

445
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,839
because he's on almost every BLT and I

446
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,180
don't see a

447
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,019
um thing about him for real it should be

448
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:30,120
bltm should be bltm red B can't have a b

449
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,420
b l TM I think we should have started

450
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,339
abbreviating [ __ ] more I know we've had

451
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,860
this horse

452
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,380
better have a bank account if you want

453
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,220
to see what I'm about I'm a good girl

454
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,220
work power

455
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,639
I'm just a freaky what's your favorite

456
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,320
road sign

457
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:54,560
road sign mine's U-turn like

458
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,639
going the other way I like a good yield

459
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,199
because it's like the balls in your

460
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,740
court like it's proceed with caution but

461
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,740
do your thing

462
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,380
that's a good stop you wanna know I

463
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,600
don't know what signs I hate I hate when

464
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,699
it's like no parking and then it's like

465
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,260
a full paragraph about when and where

466
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,579
and he's not gonna have a fun answer

467
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,380
because he can drive you know what I

468
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,579
mean yeah

469
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,679
that's true that's true

470
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,299
yeah I like road signs that are easy I

471
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,040
feel like signs are like dude what would

472
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,660
we do without signs what would you do

473
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,939
without traffic lights

474
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,520
Drive yeah and then you're just hitting

475
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,140
everything no yeah I feel like it'd be I

476
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
feel like there'd be a memory pattern if

477
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,039
it wasn't the color pattern

478
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,860
like it would be like instead of

479
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,140
following red blue green I mean red red

480
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,840
yellow green it would be it would be

481
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,760
like a pattern in memory of people it

482
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,440
was like for five seconds or five cars

483
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,940
five cars like it would be a whole Road

484
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,059
not because then people are gonna have

485
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,679
to start DR dude stop driving it away

486
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,820
people are think of older people's self

487
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,140
better like when they're driving old

488
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,780
people that are little they're like

489
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,460
colorblind like glasses to see the well

490
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,960
no because red green and yellow are the

491
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,940
probably but red green and yellow and

492
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
like the lights are never changing from

493
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,120
the right spot so colorblind people

494
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,559
probably just think like oh green likes

495
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,840
the top one yeah but how do they know

496
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,520
it's glowing

497
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,179
um because that's not color blindness

498
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,919
that's blindness then you definitely at

499
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,600
all like if you don't know it's glowing

500
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,520
that's a whole nother [ __ ] case that

501
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,740
you need to do that they have a bank

502
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,500
account if you want to see what I'm

503
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,720
about let's all think of things to add

504
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,240
the other one should start doing

505
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,780
like not like a rude way like not don't

506
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,760
oh I was gonna say shower

507
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,559
that's like so like I think you're clean

508
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,179
no Matt makes these jokes and then

509
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,440
people look we went to we went to a

510
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,360
three I think you should work hard we

511
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,400
went to a three-day festival and Chris

512
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,500
walks into the room on the third day

513
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,820
with everyone in there and he goes bro

514
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,140
he walked into the room after showering

515
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,419
from the other hotel room and he goes

516
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,880
and he goes that was the first good

517
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,100
shower I had in two days I said that was

518
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,480
the first really good shower I had in

519
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,700
like a couple days because the other

520
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,799
nights I got home so late because it was

521
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,320
a [ __ ] festival and then so I like

522
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,760
cleaned like in like like three four

523
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,620
minutes like soap all everywhere and

524
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,080
then just washed it off and then dried

525
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,960
my body off valid and then then the

526
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,059
other day I like you went to bed and

527
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,860
then I didn't have any requirements that

528
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,059
night and I actually was gonna stay up

529
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,799
until my flight so I was like you know

530
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,780
I'm gonna take a nice long shower love

531
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,240
it so then I took showers every day

532
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,000
which is a normal [ __ ] thing I do and

533
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,200
I just said to everyone soap ad on Tick

534
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
Tock and the guy goes out to people with

535
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,240
the mic he's like how many showers you

536
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,100

537
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,299
and some guy was like oh look how old is

538
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,340
your shower on the beach yeah but yeah

539
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,740
