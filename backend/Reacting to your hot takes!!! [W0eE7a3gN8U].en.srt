reverse

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,439

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,500
it's late this is a real thing that

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,780
exists

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,100
go ahead good move that was close I need

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,920
you guys to think like what's your

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,600
opinion on it okay yeah Stingray petting

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,960
zoos

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,560
um how is that happening

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,780
I think they like de-sting them yeah

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,000
yeah they do sting it so they're fully

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,700
de-stinging a stingray just so you're

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,180
not having like little kids can

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,659
gross little fingers into a little vast

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,340
of water and hold stingrays yeah

31
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,460
basically well you know you know how

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,220
they de-stank skunks or these all right

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,140
no D stink skunks they stank it yeah but

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,579
that's usually for medical purposes no

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,759
they just usually they don't want to

36
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,759
smell

37
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,680
you're telling me tomato juice is gonna

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,959
do better than like these stinking a

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,819
skunk has to be like it's like if I took

40
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,140
your nut sack off like literally like

41
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,060
that's literally that's essentially what

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,500
D stinking yeah like you know what I

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,720
mean like just give me your whole

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,120
manhood gone look at that rat just

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,239
[ __ ] spin it around in circles you

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
see him no oh

47
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,599
oh

48
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,920
he's fast did he just bang a left and he

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,540
was going I'm just thinking of like

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,360
would they not just be called raise at

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,099
that point sting oh yeah at that point

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,860
you're just a ray a little can't even

53
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,420
sting oh that's so sad actually [ __ ]

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,940
like I love the zoo but like I don't

55
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,379
like the idea of like enclosing the see

56
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,120
my thought is people like I [ __ ] with

57
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,739
like when the animal actually needs help

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,420
in the rehabilitation and they're there

59
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,400
for a reason yeah but if you just take

60
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,599
like a wild bear and throw him in a cage

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,640
for the rest of his life it's kind of

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,560
[ __ ] up yeah I don't believe in zoos

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,739
but like I'll go to the zoo but then

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,840
honestly sometimes

65
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm not as one of those I'm not one of

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,360
those guys you know I don't know too

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,920
much about this but I'm gonna share mine

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,800
you're not a zoologist you don't have to

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,060
know everything right but dude I've seen

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,159
it unreal I was gonna say something

71
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,040
right here you're fine no go ahead no

72
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,599
you just keep talking about the rats

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,280
I think like sometimes with like zoo

74
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,780
animals and [ __ ] like that even though

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
it's like oh like they're in the zoo

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,019
like they're in that little box for the

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,580
rest of their life I think if you put

78
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,959
some of those animals in the wild it

79
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,640
wouldn't they wouldn't get it yeah some

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,200
sometimes that's at fault of the zoo

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,180
yeah but like

82
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,560
I don't know it's all too confusing for

83
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,480
me I don't want to think about it you

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,519
know Dad went up to me today I I went in

85
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,319
there it's like 3 A.M 2 A.M and I went

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
to get this Red Bull because he was like

87
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,959
talking about like get rest it's

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,940
important and then we went out to go

89
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,299

90
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,980

91
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,599

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,659

96
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,739

wait until the camera was up so you

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,180
could talk about it because it was funny

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,340
what's but I don't think it's funny that

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,159
song's like a sad emo no we were just

102
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,319

won't let go

104
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,400
and Nick said ask me about that song

105
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,320
see I've been so like I have been

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,479
fighting this knowledge in my brain for

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,340
so long okay like having this story not

108
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,260
telling anyone because of how like the

109
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,560
sheer embarrassment that it brings me to

110
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,759
okay so it's really difficult for me I

111
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,560
have an embarrassing story to this song

112
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,139
too but really yeah I'll let you say it

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,060
first before it was like the first guy I

114
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,460
had ever like romantically hung out with

115
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,860
ever and this song was on and I think we

116
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,660
were on like part two of hanging out

117
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:45,660
like ever and full tears

118
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,660
sorry

119
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,419
full eruption into tears no yeah it was

120
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,560
like the second time and I was just in

121
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,560
such a State of Shock

122
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,780
and that's when I knew that it was not

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,520
gonna work at all that's crazy I never

124
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,900
knew that I'm like so that's why I can

125
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,460
never listen to that song Seriously

126
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,800
again because it's such an emotional

127
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,900
good song about someone you'd like loved

128
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,940
for years you know what I mean yeah we

129
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,620
were on like hangout number two no that

130
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,300
that's my biggest my embarrassing story

131
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,039
was I just that's crazy I'm pretty sure

132
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,320
I danced to that song in my eighth grade

133
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,340
uh at eighth grade dance with another

134
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,360
girl that I liked you know oh

135
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,460
really disgusting gross but then no I'm

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,979
not gonna say what I was gonna say weird

137
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,919
[ __ ] say it no I can't say it I can't

138
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,780
not no because then I I think our I

139
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,699
think after that for some reason that

140
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,840
when they do that song it's normally

141
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,919
supposed

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,560
yo diamonds blinging okay

143
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,199
normally normally when they do that song

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,060
it's normally like you kind of like

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
gradually get back into the other music

146
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,539
yeah you know what I mean but I just

147
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,919
remember like the girl that I didn't get

148
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,900
I didn't hit puberty until like the

149
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,120
latest out of all three of us but we

150
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,300
were still all but we were still all

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,039
like four [ __ ] ten in like eighth

152
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,660
grade seventh eighth grade yeah but I

153
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,259
was in eighth grade I think I was like

154
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,639
five foot five one maybe no Max and the

155
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,280
girl that I had a crush on was like five

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,080
eight towering over you Tower and over

157
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,199
me she still liked me though don't know

158
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,840
why I don't know yeah I was also in

159
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,240
eighth grade really strange but that

160
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,240
song plays dancing to that song right

161
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,039
and then I'm expecting like like a clean

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,020
transition into like another kind of

163
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,880
lovey song but like upbeat a little more

164
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,819
so you know what I mean yeah it went

165
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,319
straight into [ __ ] what was it I think

166
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,240
it was like a Macklemore song straight

167
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,800
to a Macklemore song and then our eighth

168
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,380
grade math teacher was break dancing

169
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,840
seconds after me and her son that's

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,580

flipping that dude was crazy I hated him

174
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:15,180
that is crazy school dances were the

175
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:18,240
worst [ __ ] thing on this Earth

176
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,400
like school dances have got to be like

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,500

334
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,380

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,079

journey

379
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,300
my favorite song when I was 11 years old

00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,760

oh it was the sugar the breaker made out

384
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,180
of sugar I thought it made me think of

385
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,380
Wreck-It Ralph immediately they were in

386
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,320
The Fun Gym you know I'm talking about

387
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,459
fungen the fun dungeon I better call me

388
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,100

389
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:49,519
Funyun candy break room break candy fun

390
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,519
gin and then you're just sneak in London

391
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,220
in the movie Wreck-It Ralph and then it

392
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,100
made me think Wreck-It Ralph

393
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,800
if you can find someone on this road

394
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,899
hold on the bubbles go with me listen if

395
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,540
you can find someone on this Earth that

396
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,399
hasn't seen Wreck-It Ralph

397
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,560
I want to watch it with them because

398
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,860
Wreck-It Ralph has one of the best

399
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,480
Cinema plot twists of all time I would

400
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,459
do anything to watch Dragon Ball with

401
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,920
someone

402
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,060
Ralph post on your story because I

403
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,940
guarantee you there's someone out there

404
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,019

405
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,699
Ralph with someone who hasn't seen it

406
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,779
before I don't think there's anybody

407
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:35,399
that passionate about it but definitely

408
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,440

441
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,320

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,740
just to unfold it and use it like

443
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,720
moments later not true yeah it was Los

444
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,880
Angeles California in our home Nick why

445
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,520
the other day yeah the other day he

446
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,020
folded off in the other day when it's

447
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,020
like four five six two weeks ago

448
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,840
80 year old

449
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,220
mother on the bus for a nickel

450
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
obviously I can say the other day the

451
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,760
other day Nick [ __ ] folds a blanket

452
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,620
puts it away in the little basket we own

453
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
and then it's like Chris can you pass me

454
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,860
a blanket I go no and he gets up and

455
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,580
takes the exact blanket that he just

456
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,080
folded to unfold it I disagree I'm

457
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,640
telling you what I saw it's not a

458
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,100
disagree moment

459
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,000
it was a disagree moment no it wasn't it

460
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,460
was a full-blown disagreement

461
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,679
how do you deem something a disagree

462
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,720
moment I'm disagreeing with you

463
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,480
in my eyes that's a [ __ ] disagree

464
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
moment it's not a disagree moment I saw

465
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,740
it happen

466
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,500
there's no disagree or agree moment I

467
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,600
disagree do you get what I'm saying that

468
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,160
