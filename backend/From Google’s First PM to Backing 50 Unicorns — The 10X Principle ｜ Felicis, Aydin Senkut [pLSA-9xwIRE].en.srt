1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
There were maybe six or seven things in

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,640
my life where I was in a very difficult

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,760
situation and I was having a very tough

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,599
time and what I did then uh led me to

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,679
being here today. I think as human

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,200
beings whenever there's a setback

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,960
whenever there is tough time there's

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,119
almost like two things we can do either

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,119
we can accept the setback we can say

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,600
okay this is terrible but then what we

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,880
do after really matters right and so I

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
think the most important thing is like

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
to suspend this belief and I think it's

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
really important because one of the

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,760
things that I tell people is that I am

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,760
really sitting here almost in every

17
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,760
critical part of my life people tried to

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,920
put me in a box and that was not the box

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,960
I wanted right like they're like oh like

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
you're going to stay in Turkey, you're

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
never going to get out of it. Then I

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,960
come to the US and like, oh, like,

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
you're only in this university and not

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
the best university. Then I go there and

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,600
they're like, you're not engineer and

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
you won't work at a tech company. Then I

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,399
come to a tech company, it's like, well,

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,000
you haven't been trained for this.

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,239
You'll never do it. And I do it and it's

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,440
like, well, you were not a VP and you

31
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,879
won't do this. And then I come to

32
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
venture capital, it's like, you can

33
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,800
never do venture capital because you've

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
never done venture capital. So I think

35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
this is just one example of like a

36
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,520
setback and disappointment. Like as

37
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,200
founders, like they're going to tell you

38
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,799
it's never going to work. This idea is

39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,880
horrible. it's not going to happen. And

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
I think at that point what you need to

41
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,920
do is like set everything aside and burn

42
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
the bridges and say the only way is just

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
basically like do whatever it takes.

44
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,479
Come up with a different idea like go

45
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
back. Is there some other way it could

46
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
be done? And that literally is the

47
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,240
difference between being successful and

48
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
making it or essentially you let other

49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,479
people put you in a box, right? And like

50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
the nice thing about it is a much harder

51
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,159
and it's big effort but it means that

52
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,000
you control your destiny, right? Like

53
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,360
yes, it might be horrible. It might be

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,119
even more difficult and nobody's

55
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
believing you or depressed, but just

56
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,520
remember that that doesn't mean that

57
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,360
somebody is taking charge of your

58
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,439
destiny. You still have control of your

59
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
destiny. And what you do with that

60
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,759
matters and that's why I like to say all

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
that setback, all that difficulty, I see

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
it as jet fuel. So put that jet fuel

63
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,159
back in the jet and like get into the

64
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,090
rocket and try to uh try to get to where

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,719
you're trying to go.

66
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,879
[Music]

67
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
Hi, thank you for having me. My name is

68
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,040
Iden Senkut. I'm the founder and

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,680
managing partner of Felicis, early stage

70
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,400
venture firm with a global mandate. We

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,160
are also very proud that so far from the

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
companies that we've invested early,

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,680
more than 45 of them have already

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,040
crossed and exceeded a billion dollars

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,360
in valuation, 100 exits. especially

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,319
proud that in a little less than 14

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,040
years. Our portfolio, we already have 17

78
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,879
IPOs, some notable portfolio companies

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
include companies that have gone public

80
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,519
and achieved a very high valuation like

81
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
Shopify and then some of the largest

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
private companies including Canva in

83
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
Australia, Notion uh in the US. I

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
believe notion was also already on the

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
EO channel. And then some other really

86
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
exciting companies uh some especially

87
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,760
focus on AI like Runway and then also

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,519
some other interesting companies like

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,519
one of our labs which is in defense and

90
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,560
AI. So before I started Felicia's

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
Ventures I was Google's first product

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
manager. When I started at Google, one

93
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
of the most interesting and brilliant

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
things we did is to launch Gmail. I

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
think Gmail was extremely important to

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
us and it really helped Google scale.

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Google was just beginning to monetize.

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,840
Believe it or not, we did not have ads

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,560
yet and Larry and Sergey were vehemently

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
against ads because they did not think

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,720
yet how we could incorporate ads in a

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
very quality way into our search

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,879
results. that came while I was at Google

104
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,519
and a huge breakthrough where we decided

105
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,360
that the way to make ads as relevant was

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,959
to basically measure and rank them by

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
click-through rate because then we could

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,879
have confidence that as users indicate

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
which ads are most helpful to them the

110
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,680
ads could be as interesting and useful

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,159
as the search results. I I would say

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
there are three main lessons. One is and

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
this is something that I especially

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,920
learned from Larry but he was very

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,000
adamant and he always really cared about

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
focusing on a very few things. I used to

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,799
joke that his favorite word was no. Uh I

118
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,799
think 90% of the time he just said no

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,959
and then very few times he said yes. But

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,560
when he said yes, you knew that that was

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,720
something that mattered and everybody

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
rallied around and try to make that

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
possible whatever it was he was asking.

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
The other thing that Larry did that I

125
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,360
think was very interesting is he always

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,759
asked for very uncomfortable, very

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,759
difficult goals. I think that the other

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,680
message from that was you cannot build a

129
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,320
truly great company if you're only

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,919
striving for a 10% or 20% improvement.

131
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
We did something interesting at Google

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,120
where we essentially had a very healthy

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
disrespect of status quo and what we did

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,639
is often times we tried to find the

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
world's smartest people gave them

136
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,400
challenges whether they had an

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,320
experience or knowledge in this area or

138
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
not and just told them to do it. So a

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
good example of that I used to bike with

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
the lead engineer in the ads serving

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,160
team and interestingly that engineer was

142
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
not specialized in ad serving at all.

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,600
One day Sergey went to him and said,

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
"Oh, we decided that we're going to

145
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
build an ad server. Chad," his name was

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
Chad, "you're very smart. Pick five more

147
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
engineers. You have about 6 months. And

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
in 6 months, I want to make sure that we

149
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
have a functioning ad server." And they

150
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
did it. And I joke, they did it because

151
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,039
they had no idea what they were getting

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
into. And so they just made it happen.

153
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
And if this wasn't in any other large

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
company, they would have asked for

155
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
hundreds of engineers and probably said

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
it would take them a couple years to

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
build something like that.

158
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
So, one of the rules or principles that

159
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,919
stuck with me from my days at Google is

160
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,840
the 10X principle. Meaning that if you

161
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,520
want to be really great at something

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,880
like if you have a startup, even in an

163
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,160
investment firm, whatever it is that

164
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,240
you're doing, if you're working at a

165
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,919
company, starting a company, scaling a

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,479
company, it is very important that

167
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,560
whatever is you do has to be 10 times

168
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,039
better, 10 times cheaper or 10 times

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
faster, maybe ideally all three than the

170
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,360
competition, than the existing

171
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
solutions. this uh give me a sense of

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,240
the philosophy of your own mind. I mean

173
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,000
you have this idea of 10x I mean you you

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,319
don't simply want uh to go in some small

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,160
measurable arena of

176
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,600
progress. Yeah. I think you know many of

177
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,800
the things we just talked about are like

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,720
that where they're really non you I

179
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,960
almost use the economic concept of

180
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
additionality. Yeah. Which means that

181
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,440
you're doing something that wouldn't

182
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,080
happen unless you're actually doing it.

183
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,840
And um I think the more you can do

184
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,639
things like that, the bigger impact you

185
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
have.

186
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,160
And you know that's about doing things

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,280
that are you know people might not think

188
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
are possible. And I've been amazed the

189
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,240
more I learn about technology the more I

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,960
realize I don't know. And that's because

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,919
this technological

192
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,160
horizon the thing that you can see to do

193
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,280
next. The more you learn about

194
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,280
technology the more you learn what's

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,039
possible. you learn that the balloons

196
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,840
are possible because there's some

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,160
material that will work for them. So the

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
10x principle can also apply to the

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
markets that you decide to go after. I

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,039
think one of the things that we really

201
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
care when we're making investment

202
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,520
decisions, the number one thing is that

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,840
we try to find markets that are poised

204
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,160
for great growth. The markets can be

205
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
either very large or can potentially

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
become very large, especially if there

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,599
is great growth, if there is a critical

208
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,360
product. And one of the things that we

209
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,360
like to think most of our most

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,880
successful companies have a very broad

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
customer base. For instance, if you look

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
at Shopify powering commerce, I mean

213
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,720
commerce basically applies to almost

214
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,960
every business in the world. Adan with

215
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
payments. Any business if they want to

216
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
create revenues, they have to have

217
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,720
payments or some of our other companies

218
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,160
like recursion or cancer. I mean at the

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
end of the day there are certain

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
illnesses and diseases in the world that

221
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,160
unfortunately at some point might affect

222
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
either ourselves or our family members

223
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
or our friends. So, we love companies

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
that are doing something not just

225
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
important, but something that's

226
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,840
potentially applicable to almost

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,599
anywhere in the world. We can see this

228
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
as the extension of the 10X principle

229
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
because the larger the market, the

230
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
higher the potential for a company to be

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
successful. But one of the other things

232
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,639
that we really pay great attention to is

233
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,360
that the companies are doing something

234
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,599
that is so revolutionary, so incredible

235
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,520
that the impact coincides with the 10x

236
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,840
principle. It's that 10x better, 10x

237
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,759
faster, 10x cheaper. We tell our team

238
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,160
over and over again is look for that

239
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,840
either that the company can do it or the

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
company has an idea and the potential to

241
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,919
do

242
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,399
it. We really start with the market and

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,159
one of the reasons for that is I call it

244
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
is almost like a Newtonian law in

245
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,560
startups is that when anything else goes

246
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
against markets the markets win. So you

247
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,839
have to be in the right market and you

248
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,839
also roughly have to get the timing

249
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,080
right. So I think one of the ways that

250
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,160
we try to make our decisions better and

251
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
use mental you know conserve mental

252
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
power we are very selective in the

253
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,440
markets that we go after and once we

254
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
choose that I feel it's one of the most

255
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,120
important parts of the decision then the

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,279
secret is can you identify the founders

257
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
that can really scale I obviously am not

258
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
going to lie to you founders are

259
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
extremely important and the next most

260
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
important thing in our decision process

261
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,320
is essentially understanding founders

262
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
understanding people and this is an

263
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
important point because not only do we

264
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
have and this is the reason why the

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
teams Diversity is really important, but

266
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
one of the things that I don't think

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,440
people appreciate it in my background is

268
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,519
the fact that I spend a lot of time in

269
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
sales. Spend a lot of time trying to

270
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,880
understand people. And everybody thinks

271
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,240
venture capital is finance. It's all

272
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,240
about the numbers, but everybody's good

273
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
at numbers in venture capital. What is

274
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
more difficult and more rare is being

275
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,399
able to understand people and being able

276
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,160
to relate to people. So, I feel like

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
that was my superpower that really

278
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
helped me be a great investor. And we

279
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,839
actually went even beyond that. And one

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,080
of our operating part amazing operating

281
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
partner we brought on uh Michelle Delra

282
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
who joined us from stripe and she also

283
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,080
worked at stripe octa data bricks each

284
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
one of these companies were 10 billion

285
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,399
plus in value and she specializes in you

286
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,080
know people and like recruiting and

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
interviewing people. So, we actually

288
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,320
like have her often join our investment

289
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
meetings when we're evaluating founding

290
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
teams because we want her to also look

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
at the founding team and say what she

292
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,200
thinks of the team and if she thinks

293
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
that their culture or their ideas or

294
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,320
something about them gives us confidence

295
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,920
that they're going to build a truly

296
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
great and enduring company. And it's

297
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
again something that we do that's very

298
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
different and unique where people that

299
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
have these different strengths and not

300
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,519
necessarily part of the investment team

301
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,519
are leveraged before we actually make an

302
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,839
investment decision.

303
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
I mean, I can pick some some examples.

304
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
Look, I think one of the most impressive

305
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,600
ones is Shopify. Shopify was another

306
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
incredible concept. You know, Toby,

307
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
who's the founder of Shopify with his

308
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,440
two co-founders, actually he wanted to

309
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,279
do a snowboard store and realized that

310
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
there were no no great tools available

311
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,360
to do that. And then he basically

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,279
decided that actually a better idea was

313
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,959
to start a software company. He was

314
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,880
clearly very good at that. But he had

315
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,800
some really unique insights. One,

316
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,040
Shopify underpriced the product to make

317
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,720
it available. Shopify I think always

318
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
undercharged for the product because

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
they thought hey if people are getting

320
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,680
value and those businesses are scaling

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
they can grow with those businesses. I

322
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,279
think Toby also made some really great

323
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,440
decisions. I will mention couple for

324
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,920
instance from very early on even though

325
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,079
Shopify was very easy to use. People

326
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,079
were still finding Shopify and using it

327
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,600
through agencies and other channels. So

328
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
they went to the channel and agencies

329
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
said look we're not going to give you a

330
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,120
one-time fee. If somebody is using

331
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,560
Shopify through you and they continue

332
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
using it through you, you're going to

333
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
get lifetime commissions. So,

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,519
underpricing the product, fantastic

335
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,959
product, treating the channel really

336
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,800
well and being very creative of giving

337
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
them lifetime commissions. I think the

338
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
other aspect of it, similar to what I

339
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
experienced at Google, Toby realized

340
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,560
what were the most important product

341
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
aspects. So, for instance, when Shopify

342
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,079
launched payments, it was at a perfect

343
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,079
time and it really contributed the

344
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,000
company's stratospheric growth. So

345
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
again, the idea that hey, listen, if you

346
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
want to scale a business, there's going

347
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,640
to be a few really important decisions

348
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,560
and it's important to get it right. The

349
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,399
last nuance, this by the way happened

350
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,320
both at Google and Shopify, but both

351
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,800
Google and Shopify had very good

352
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,640
internal uh data, real-time data on how

353
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,399
the business ran. And for instance, like

354
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,480
early on Google when we were even like

355
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,160
50 people, we had internal dashboards

356
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
that I could see anything from which

357
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
servers are up to how many cues are

358
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,839
being served around the world and how

359
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,440
our customers doing. Every aspect of the

360
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,120
business is available. the information

361
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
on it was available in real time. I

362
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
think Shopify built something like that

363
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,800
internally as well. I always like to use

364
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
the example of F1 is one of my favorite

365
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
sports and one of the things that's

366
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,600
special about it is it's a sport where

367
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
everything is measured in 1/1,000 of a

368
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,480
second and the success is often

369
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
determined by very very tiny like minute

370
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
differences and they can do that because

371
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,920
they measure every aspect of everything

372
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
that's happening. One of the biggest

373
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,200
things that I learned for startups is

374
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
that yes, you might want to be

375
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,880
successful, but the only way to do that

376
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
if you know what to measure and you're

377
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,440
measuring it in a very comprehensive way

378
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,680
because that then allows you to realize

379
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
that

380
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,720
performance. I think there are many

381
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,399
factors. We will talk about personal

382
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,160
elements of founders but I will

383
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,760
reiterate I think being in the right

384
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,200
market is very important. So if you

385
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,639
choose the wrong market is very

386
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,720
difficult to be successful if not

387
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
impossible. So no matter what happens I

388
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,760
think finding the right market and

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
ideally getting the timing mostly right

390
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,519
is very important. After that I think

391
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,120
there are certain elements. Number one

392
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
whoever is the founder you need to be

393
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
very focused. I think early on because

394
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,200
you have very few people the tendency is

395
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,200
well the only way I can feel successful

396
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,519
and great as a CEO is if I'm doing like

397
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
50 things. But the reality is there are

398
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,720
very few things that truly is going to

399
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
make a difference in the company. and

400
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,000
doing 50 things or 20 things, it means

401
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
that you're not going to do each one of

402
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
them extremely well. But success in the

403
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,600
beginning means you have to be focused.

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
You have very limited resources.

405
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,760
Understand one or two things that matter

406
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,279
and absolutely do the best job in those

407
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,040
things. The only way you can do that is

408
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,680
if you're able to focus on them and do a

409
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,160
great job. One important thing is uh

410
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,600
just consistency and you know staying at

411
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,200
it like I'll give you an example like

412
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
one of the tough things as a startup

413
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,279
speed is your biggest friend. You can do

414
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,040
many things with a small team but

415
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,040
because the team is really small in the

416
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,880
beginning probably the progress will not

417
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
be super big. There will be like small

418
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000
things but what we forget is small

419
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
things can compound to something very

420
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,519
big. And then the other thing that I

421
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,279
will say I think everybody thinks that

422
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,800
great companies succeed in a straight

423
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,560
line and they never succeed in a

424
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,720
straight line. So I think one of the

425
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,040
hardest things to do as a founder is

426
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,920
essentially like take setback, take

427
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,680
disappointment, take no, take skeptics

428
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,680
and then keep going, right? like you

429
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,839
have to like be at it. And to me like

430
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,240
what I always like to say is um people

431
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,360
that underestimate me or my team any

432
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,440
type of rejection any type of setback or

433
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,040
disappointment I call it jet fuel like

434
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
it makes you angry you know it makes you

435
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,120
upset creates this feeling it's like no

436
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,959
like we deserve better honestly how you

437
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,120
feel doesn't matter but what does matter

438
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,800
is to take that mental energy and then

439
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,399
say okay you know what I'm going to take

440
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,639
that and make things better I'm going to

441
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
do try one more time I'm going to try a

442
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,320
different way and that's what it takes

443
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,560
and sometimes it might be 10 times 20

444
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
times 30 times until you get to the

445
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,199
first time where it's a yes or it works

446
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,800
or your first customer. But it's very

447
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,440
important that you stay at it and you

448
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,279
don't give up. I think the second thing

449
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
we kind of touched on it but how

450
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,880
important it is to find a way to measure

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,639
success. Let's say that we have a

452
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
vision. We you know we want to be very

453
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,000
successful. Well like for instance if

454
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
you want to be a great successful

455
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,160
investment firm you need to have you

456
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
know density of success from a 100

457
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
investments you make. How many of them

458
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
are exited? how many of them become

459
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,880
successful companies. These are very

460
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
black and white numbers. If we say we

461
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,320
have a global strategy, one of the

462
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
things that I'm very proud of any stage

463
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
that we worked at, any sector we looked

464
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,639
at, any country we invested in, pretty

465
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,399
much every single area of our strategy,

466
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,240
we have a success. We have an IPO or an

467
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,760
exit. And so that basically makes it

468
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
very black and white. And when you can

469
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,680
measure things that specifically, it

470
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,279
really does help like optimize and you

471
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
know like make the business successful.

472
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,040
Um that's I think like super important

473
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,199
as well. I think the last aspect of it

474
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
is combination storytelling, combination

475
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,360
charm. Let me explain. I think one of

476
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,600
the most important jobs of a founder,

477
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
especially a CEO, is you have to be able

478
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,839
to get customers. You have to be able to

479
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
hire people. You have to be able to keep

480
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,440
scaling the company even when times are

481
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,040
hard. A lot of times that means that you

482
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
have to be a great storyteller because

483
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,399
let's be honest, if you're buying

484
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,079
something today, you're not buying

485
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,759
something just because of the product

486
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,360
and some future, but there is something

487
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,720
about that brand that appeals to you.

488
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,639
It's the same thing when we're joining

489
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,560
companies is that yes, you know, maybe

490
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,160
at the end it's a job, but the company's

491
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,079
culture and the company's vibe really

492
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,839
matters. How charismatic the leader is

493
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,440
matters. And so that's very important.

494
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,279
And I think something that I found in

495
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,839
founders and it is unfortunately not

496
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,759
negotiable. Like you either have to have

497
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,440
yourself or like maybe a co-founder

498
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,279
who's very good at storytelling, who's

499
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
very charismatic so that it allows you

500
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,880
to hire amazing people. And part of it

501
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,480
is also the mission. The more ambitious

502
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,000
the mission of the company, obviously

503
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,079
the more people will get excited about

504
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,560
it. And that comes again back to the 10X

505
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,959
principle is that a lot of times ideas

506
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,600
are ideas but some ideas are more

507
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,519
powerful and more scary than others. So

508
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,440
the bigger the idea and the bigger the

509
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
impact I think then even though it might

510
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,639
be difficult it's going to inspire

511
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,079
people and it's going to motivate them

512
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,440
to do something that's really hard

513
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,959
because at the end of the day we want

514
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
our lives to have purpose and the best

515
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,679
way to do that is if you're pursuing a

516
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,760
very challenging problem. I think I was

517
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,000
a horrible storyteller and how do I know

518
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,240
that? When I first tried to start

519
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,799
Felicis, I had, I think, at least 40

520
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,400
nos. It was very disappointing because I

521
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,720
thought I was telling a great story and

522
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,480
I was very proud of my idea and I was

523
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,199
very excited about what we're going to

524
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
build. And honestly, the main strategy

525
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,120
has always been the same. But what I

526
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,039
realized is that what I was trying to

527
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,960
talk about and what people were hearing

528
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,200
were not always the same. What I also

529
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,919
started appreciating is that it wasn't

530
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,679
just important what I was telling but I

531
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,000
needed to understand what people cared

532
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,160
about on the other side. And so for me a

533
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,760
lot of it came down to just practice. I

534
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
think I shared with my team but when we

535
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
got our first check I think the version

536
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
of our deck was like 107 which means

537
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
that we had 107 revisions to the deck

538
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
that the message was the same. The

539
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,480
strategy was the same but we like

540
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,799
iterated 107 times to tell the story 107

541
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,320
ways until the first person said yes. I

542
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
think the second thing is you have to be

543
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,000
a great student of people. I think a lot

544
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,000
of times we get so excited about the

545
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,080
ideas as founders. All we can think

546
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,240
about is what we love and what we are

547
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
going to do and why we think this is

548
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
going to be successful. We don't think

549
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,200
as much about the other people. And so

550
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,120
part of being a great storyteller is

551
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,320
know your audience. And in order to know

552
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,919
your audience, you need to really

553
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
understand them. Who are they? Where did

554
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
they come from? What do they like? Where

555
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,799
did they go to school? How how were they

556
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,440
brought up? And I think that matters

557
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,520
because it feels like the last 10% of

558
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,240
the details are maybe the 90% of the

559
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,840
value. But most people do the first 90%

560
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
but then they don't want to put the

561
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,080
effort into the last 10%. And the last

562
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,080
small details can make a very big

563
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,200
difference. One of the things that I'm

564
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,120
really proud of investment is a tough

565
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
business because what we do is

566
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,240
essentially like we're writing checks

567
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,760
but the thing that we're doing is not

568
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
something you can touch. like you can't

569
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,600
touch this table and say look we are

570
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,679
carpenters and we make great tables. The

571
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,320
thing that really means the world to us

572
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,880
is twofold. One, we feel that as our

573
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,880
portfolio globally becomes larger, it's

574
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,640
becoming more and more clear to us that

575
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
every minute, every hour of the day,

576
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,160
somebody in the world is interfacing,

577
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
interacting with the Felic's portfolio

578
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,039
company and hopefully in a good way,

579
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
right? Whether it's one of our, you

580
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,440
know, biotech companies like curing a

581
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,960
rare disease or cancer, diagnosing a

582
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,200
disease, it's one of our other companies

583
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
like Shopify helping somebody uh become

584
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
an entrepreneur or at the end, you know,

585
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,440
help process payments. uh or one of our

586
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
you know creativity company like Canva

587
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,320
maybe it's a kid at school and you know

588
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
they want to create something and the

589
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,720
first tool they use is Canva and that's

590
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,720
a very fantastic feeling that the way

591
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,320
that the world is today the way it's

592
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
going to be in the future and as the

593
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,919
future gets created it's Felissa's

594
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,360
companies that are taking the lead to

595
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,960
create that future and that's an

596
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
incredible feeling and then I think the

597
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,960
same is true uh about our limited

598
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
partners so the people that invest in

599
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,039
our funds basically they're all like

600
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,880
endowments they are health systems uh

601
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,880
their organizations that have kind of a

602
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,640
charitable cause or mission. Uh and some

603
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,559
of our other foundations or families

604
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
that we work with are working on freedom

605
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,840
of speech or you know they have like

606
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
great charitable causes like saving the

607
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
oceans and all of that. So what we feel

608
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,600
great is that we are not just about

609
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,200
financial returns but the impact of that

610
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,200
is going to be making the world a better

611
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,799
place. Partly true with our companies

612
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,679
but also partly through our limited

613
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,120
partners and our

614
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,520
investors. I really would like to see

615
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,679
technology play a bigger role in peace

616
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,080
whatever that may be. I mean, look, I I

617
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,919
think I also want technology to make us

618
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
happier because one of the things that

619
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,039
I'm seeing that stresses me out. I have

620
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,039
two kids, teenagers, and I see how much

621
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
technology is pervasive in their life.

622
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,679
But I am also seeing maybe compared to

623
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,520
my generation. This generation has a lot

624
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,120
more in terms of technology and wealth,

625
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,039
but they're more stressed and they have

626
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,200
more mental issues than I've ever seen.

627
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,280
I think it's very important that we have

628
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
to take ownership and responsibility.

629
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,799
the world is not just about the impact

630
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,039
that technology can have and the wealth

631
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,679
that it can create, but if it's making

632
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,840
us more depressed and less happy, I feel

633
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,400
like then we we lost the point. We

634
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,159
missed the point. So to me, my dream and

635
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,760
my hope would be that not only does

636
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,840
technology keep advancing, which it

637
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,559
will, will create more value, which it

638
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,480
will, but it also has a positive impact

639
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,240
on humanity. I'm not just saying like

640
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,200
cleaning up the oceans or whatever, but

641
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,679
we as people hopefully like my kids

642
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
generation can say, "Oh, like we are a

643
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,080
little bit happier and we're little bit

644
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,760
less stressed uh than my generation."

645
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
Uh, and that would be a great dream. If

646
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,400
technology can achieve that, I feel like

647
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,400
we're going to be in a much better

648
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
place.
