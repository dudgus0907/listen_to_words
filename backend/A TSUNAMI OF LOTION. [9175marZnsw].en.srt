80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,280
tire do you guys know how sometimes we

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,400
like walk past each other and like

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,159
karate chop each other or like we like

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,400
joking I do that all the time well today

84
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,080
dad was walking into the kitchen and I

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,519
thought for sure it was

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,680
Chris and he was like refilling his cup

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,480
of ginger Rail and he was like walking

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,080
with his cup and he like jingled his ice

89
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,760
like this like you went like wasn't

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,159
really paying attention so it's like I I

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,640
am a slow human being like I am not very

92
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:42,120
agile and mobile or flexible but I have

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,480
the mindset of a [ __ ] Cobra like my

94
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,959
my my I get stimulated and then it's

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,159
like my reaction is just like I want to

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,959
like just break something in half like

97
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll hear like a noise behind me and

98
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,319
I'll think I'm like a [ __ ] elephant

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,560
and I can turn around and just [ __ ]

100
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,360
Pummel it over elephant can't turn fast

101
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,200
but yes shut the [ __ ] up but I'm walking

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
and I hear like the little glass jingle

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,239
and Cobra Nicks turns on and it's like

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
oh I need to [ __ ] attack so I hear

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,400
the jingle of the ice and I I swear to

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,040
God I just started laughing instantly

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,360
cuz my body didn't physically do

108
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,880
anything but mentally I just wanted to

109
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,759
kick the glass into the ceiling have ice

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,880
[ __ ] fly everywhere like my brain

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,040
just attacks my physical body and it's

112
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,919
like attack attack attack like you knew

113
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,680
you were dialed in like if it was you

114
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,199
and not Dad I think it being dad was the

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,960
only thing that set my brain back to

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,320
like relax but if it was you and not dad

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,320
that ice would have hit the [ __ ]

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,440
comfortable I could be is in a bed with

223
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,959
10 girls and a pillow and a big blanket

224
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,160

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,640
slightly all right so if this is your

236
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,480
comfort zone what's right in the middle

237
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,720
my comfort zone is being with a group of

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
