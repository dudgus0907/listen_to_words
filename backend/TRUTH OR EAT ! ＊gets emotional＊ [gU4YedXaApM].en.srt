32
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,360
right now basically Matt you're going to

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,640
be served your three tacos per usual and

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,520
you have to eat them as fast as you can

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,960
not happening yes yes it is well no you

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,600
don't have to eat them as pass yeah you

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,200
can take your time but here's the thing

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,960
every minute that passes while you're

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,640
eating we're going to ask you like an

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,119
relatively invasive I wouldn't say

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,119
invasive but more of uncomforting and

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,320
you have to a personal question that you

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,880
So the faster you eat the tacos the less

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,039
question questions you have to answer so

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,840
hypothetically if you do a minute perac

46
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,119

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759

most romantic thing you've ever done is

244
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,000

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,959
constantly saying you smell bad and

310
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
don't shower cuz like it's like that's

311
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,160
he's like he's a kid you know so like

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
isn't attacking your sanitary needs yeah

315
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,600
like you're you're saying something

316
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
that's not real you act tough and I get

317
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,880
called tough and get pissed about care

318
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,519
all right time

319
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,399
resume

320
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,600
third question okay give me the inside

321
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,399
scoop on what the perfect Chris yellow

322
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
date night looks

323
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,519
like if I'm dating somebody they have to

324
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,720
get along with all my friends and peers

325
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:52,320
okay so ideally maybe maybe I'll go to

326
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,199
like dinner all not like all like all go

327
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,120
out and do something like me and like is

328
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:58,120
this like a super like intimate like

329
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,040
just being the first it's a first date

330
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,160
it's on group hang out really what's the

331
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,240
perfect date you've never been on a date

332
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,600
what's your perfect ideal date probably

333
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,440
like an activity of some sort that's fun

334
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,360
together like what's the activity oh my

335
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,560
God can I get to the [ __ ] can I have

336
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,720
a millisecond like bowling or like Top

337
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Golf cute fun mini golf something along

338
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
what you guys getting a top golf like

339
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,480
pretzel bites the share biting them in

340
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,079
half you wish no I don't I can care L

341
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
bowling or like how are you get in there

342
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,760
you ubering or she picking you

343
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,199
up hey relax well no top golf serves

344
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,839
food and so does bowling so I feel like

345
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,279
we'd have probably a couple like

346
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,199
appetizers there that's all right and

347
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,760
then so we're not going to be like full

348
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,560
like we're not going to be like hungry

349
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,680
but we're not going to be like full okay

350
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,320
so like probably like somewhere where we

351
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,519
can just like relax like for food no

352
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,440
like after

353
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,720
after no we already ate at the activity

354
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,480
as well so then probably like maybe like

355
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,800
the beach or like a walk in the park or

356
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,000
like somewhere to just walk in the park

357
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,800
if we're hungry again go to dinner again

358
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,560
W oh my God what timer I thought that I

359
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,240
thought M said Date Night Like This is a

360
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,519
full day for me like an Excursion I like

361
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,759
booked the driver we might as well

362
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
utilize it all day I so like maybe

363
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,480
dinner again but if she's not hungry

you're getting a two for one lucky you

376
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,680
when in your life were you the happiest

377
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,680
and when in your life were you the

378
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
saddest

379
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,959
I'd say it's so hard to say when in your

380
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,959
life were you the happiest cuz the true

381
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,560
answer is probably when I was like eight

382
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,240
or something oh my

383
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,240

all the time like going to the zoo with

388
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:31,000

389
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,600

probably like junior year like but no

431
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,400
cuz it wasn't Co it was like I'd say

432
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,799
when things were normal again after Co

433
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,559
yeah senior year yeah like things being

434
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,319
normal again after Co I like loved my co

435
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,400
life you have the identical response

436
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,480
that I would have had cuz I loved my co

437
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,840
life cuz I was like I was gay and just

438
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,600
like at home and didn't have to deal

439
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,880
with anybody or anything and then

440
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,000
leaving like the safe haven of like Co

441
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,799
at home was just exhausting no being

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,799
going to school for like senior year

443
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:45,440
with Co like and Co being a thing and

444
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:48,760
like just that whole I hated senior year

445
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,280
so much I would I regret every single

446
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,360
thing other than YouTube I age us three

447
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,480
pursuing YouTube was the only beneficial

448
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,000
thing that happened that year in my

449
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,480
opinion check K agree yeah I agree

450
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,720
shocking first Taco I can't believe what

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,919
video we're filming and that yeah like

452
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,360
dude I was just crying right with you oh

453
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,200
my God that was so much but I also think

454
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,559
of like senior year and I think like for

455
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,080
us three as a core brother best

456
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,600

457
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,480
together starting YouTube together and

458
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,840
like chasing our dreams it was like also

459
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,760
the highest point of my life so it's

460
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
like weird to say that's the saddest but

461
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,520
I think it's just cuz like I learned the

462
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,960
most about like the reality of life and

463
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
that's what was sad about

464
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,840
yeah but like other than that like the

465
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
journey was super like exciting like

466
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,000
graduating high school is always going

467
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
to be sad and like moving on not even

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,559
graduating high school it wasn't even

469
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,039

pizza

479
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,400

to never forget our 19th birthday

484
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,480
yeah and I'll say I don't think this is

485
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,320
a memory I'm like actively trying to not

486
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,159
