dude people are gonna think that this is

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,000
scripted why people are gonna start to

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,600

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,220
dirty warped watermelon why

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,200
because I thought that that's what you

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,520
were gonna say so I was like Nick if you

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,280

it's about the that's actually that's

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,860
like the most that was the weirdest [ __ ]

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,960
ever that's the most triplet connection

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,600
like an apple or like a cantaloupe and I

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,920
was like

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,060
I was gonna say like oh I think it looks

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,219
like a watermelon then pull this I was

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,200
like no it's the witch from Oz

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,200
why was he just what

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,379
Nick recess

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,340
I don't know if you could see him

53
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,560
through the back window but that guy

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,000
just went by on a bike and was like

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,260
like he never stopped looking at our car

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,540
that was terrifying but look yeah Matt

57
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,860
no NYX literally said you guys he goes

58
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,480
you guys go to the car early because I'm

59
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,640
gonna grab something I don't want you to

60
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,260
see

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,879
and then and then he said that I didn't

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,739
even know what he meant for me to say

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,300
but that's crazy that I guess that yeah

64
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,860
that was pretty terrifying well there

65
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,260
really isn't that many fruits that are

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,700
like head shaped I guess but in fact he

67
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,680
said dirty warped and that's what I have

68
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,060
yeah I feel like I'm more cantaloupe

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
though so that's like a little upsetting

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,120

keep walking Buckaroo the biggest red

105
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,480
flag of me I don't know if I said this

106
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,099
recently okay car video or not but I

107
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,440
wrote it down the biggest red flag for

108
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,239
me of all time is when it comes to new

109
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,239
people if you can't picture them

110
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,560
sad and alone

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,239
[Music]

112
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,639
like if you meet someone and you can't

113
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,739
picture them like sad and alone at some

114
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,580
point to some level that's a red flag

115
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,020
for me I disagree really I think if you

116
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,120
can't picture them sadden alone

117
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,100
everybody gets sad and alone so that

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,960
means they're just over compensating for

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,340
something which means they truly are

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,340
it's really sad no look

121
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,440
here I can remember like not being able

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,900
to picture them like sad and alone

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,340
even though they had this like sad front

124
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,380
constantly

125
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,680
and that's why I was like

126
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,960
hmm I don't even know what you mean bro

127
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,180
like if I can't picture someone I'm

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
gonna if I cannot picture someone's sad

129
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,100
and alone that's a big red flag what

130
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,240
about sad and together no I feel like

131
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,240
dude I'm always sad

132
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,699
whenever I'm alone no Chris yeah

133
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,840
garlic bread is easily yeah

134
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,580
yeah the thing that makes me the

135
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,860
happiest

136
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,600
like without questions dude did you see

137
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,539
the amount of garlic you put on it there

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,919
is ungodly I was I was like I literally

139
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,600
was sitting there at the kitchen just

140
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,539
minding my own business probably on

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,680
Pokemon go and Nick's just Nick's just

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,720
like this

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,060
doing the thing and then it's just like

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,060
it all pours out like on top

145
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,759
a little bit and like and like press on

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,500
the top so it like fell down like I like

147
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,259
waking up the next day and still tasting

148
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,080
garlic you don't you know that's [ __ ]

149
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,400
gross that's [ __ ] gross I'm kidding I

150
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,600
just wanted to see what you would say do

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,919
not brush your teeth you know I could

152
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,139
brush my teeth that's good I love

153
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,100
brushing my teeth actually people who

154
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,539
don't brush their teeth they're the

155
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
dirtiest of dirty and like they try and

156
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,000
like like little kids used to try and

157
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,460
get away with like not brushing their

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,960
teeth it's like you are you nasty little

159
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,639
hate brushing my teeth when I was

160
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,280
younger like around like 10. look that's

161
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,500
weird or 11. like I just hated brushing

162
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,360
my teeth like it was such a big deal so

163
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,820
Mom and Dad would like make me brush my

164
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,580
teeth and I would just run the water and

165
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,139
stand there gross I think it's [ __ ]

166
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,780
mind-blowing that I didn't say the word

167
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,860
[ __ ] till like senior year dude I was

168
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,660
thinking about like actually

169
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,400
mind-blowing because that when I just

170
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,720
said [ __ ] and then picture myself as a

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,360
10 year old kid

172
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,100
like no I thought well I should have

173
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,380
been cursing since I was like like we

174
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,880
didn't we never used to swear until we

175
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,039
were like

176
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,919
not even freshman year I didn't swear

177
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,199
until like junior year of high school I

178
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,940
remember the first time I swore to each

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,039
other in a conversation I think our

180
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,660
first YouTube video ever

181
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,000
literally one of our first YouTube

182
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,740
videos ever I probably my first swear

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,699
was probably like three months before

184
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,199
that

185
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:06,539
that's insane I'm I'm so for real put it

186
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,940
on my life God I see our old content and

187
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,520
I feel like I was so little

188
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,199
yeah but like where I was no I think my

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,240
least favorite thing that people that

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
like a comment I see is like there's 20.

191
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,860
it's like yep

192
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,539
yeah yeah and we're we're funny I look I

193
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,360
look the most different out of all of us

194
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,460
three and I let I fully have like for

195
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,900
real I think that I might take the cake

196
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,599
on that

197
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,340
I think you you or me he looks exactly

198
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,900
well I've always had the same hair but I

199
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,000
thought that [ __ ] was Zendaya like but

200
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,680
only the Spider-Man version guys like

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
the Mary Jane guys

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,960
yeah I feel like Baton Rouge is such a

203
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,120
good dope city name

204
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,880
with Baton Rouge Louisiana Indianapolis

205
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,139
Indiana we were talking about this the

206
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,599
other day because we were talking with

207
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,940
like old friends about school and I

208
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,560
remember I you know the states and

209
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,940
capitals there's 50 states obviously and

210
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,800
they all have a capital and we had to

211
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,740
like memorize the song and memorize them

212
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,000
all and I remember in fourth grade I

213
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,919
memorized every single one of them and

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,500
took the states and capitals test and my

215
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,479
teacher gave me a 49 out of 50 but it

216
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,400
was like the answers were matching so it

217
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,780
was a list

218
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,699
you had to get an even number score in

219
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,800
order to like even have taken the test

220
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,900
so I showed it to her and she [ __ ]

221
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,520
marked Rhode Island wrong I'm like

222
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,379
you're dumb as [ __ ] like you're [ __ ]

223
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,120
lousy bro get it together one of my

224
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,099
favorite terms wait I wanted to ask you

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,479
guys this question what's the max amount

226
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,039
of things you could cook while you're

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,680
hungry that you'd think you could eat

228
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,320
and then realize how much you made

229
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,000
wow you know what I mean hold on no no I

230
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,120
don't know what's the max amount of

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,640
things you could cook for yourself while

232
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,020
you're hungry and then realize you like

233
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
made too much

234
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,519
like you ever like me making [ __ ]

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,220
because there's any sense to you at all

236
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,540
honestly I'm trying to avoid the

237
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,760
question because I've been able to eat

238
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,700
like a [ __ ] hungry gorilla lately

239
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,959
like I could eat a lot like depending

240
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,339
the circumstances of what it is like

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,100
so you don't want to see me on the tour

242
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,839
bus at 2AM because I could put down a

243
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,440
lot of food you're a major little bite

244
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,120
guy oh my God no bites down like dude I

245
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,339
think the max that I've ever eaten in

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,959
one sitting is an entire box of

247
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,640
Cheez-Its which is crazy

248
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,800
I hate Cheez-Its I eat a handful of

249
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,480
Cheez-Its I dislike cheese and I'm back

250
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,399

317
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,300

318
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
we're like oh tell us about it and it's

319
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,120
we thought he was gonna say something

320
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,100
that like matched what we were saying

321
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,380
like equally as weird like eat grass or

322
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,899
like yeah he goes yeah the the kid used

323
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,700
to watch like magic shows where the guy

324
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,260
would just Ozzy Osbourne I don't know

325
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,820
who this is I don't know who Ozzy

326
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,100
Osbourne is but apparently he did like

327
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,959
crazy [ __ ] in his magic shows and dad

328
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,839
said that the kid was like inspired from

329
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,920
that and at recess he ate a pigeon's

330
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,260
head off

331
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,140
he found a bit and grabbed it ate its

332
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,700
head off why your reaction was not great

333
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,200
enough for me well because I heard dad

334
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,560
say it kind of like a little bit from

335
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,540
the other one reaction the kid a bit a

336
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,540
[ __ ] pigeon's head off

337
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:40,260
the pigeon's head alive is a different

338
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,560
story if it was dead already in like

339
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,040
there's no what no I'm not there's no

340
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,019
like there's no like what [ __ ] don't

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,399
look at you you stupid [ __ ] there's

342
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:55,100
never an excuse to bite of awesome not

343
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,600
as weird but Dad said that the same kid

344
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,079
ate a water gun like the little water

345
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
yeah

346
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,399
like dude wait hold on wait I'm trying

347
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,079
to think like when you bite a pigeon's

348
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,240
head off that means the whole beak gotta

349
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,060
be in your throat dude it has to Die the

350
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,320
decisions beaked out of me he didn't eat

351
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,139
it no but like still like to bite

352
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,180
is that not terrifying oh my God I

353
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,920

you don't want to be on their bad side

374
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,360

375
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,760
for dinner correct it's like for sure

376
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,800

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,600
fight like if we know we get noticed by

378
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,100

punching each other yeah just like hit

380
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,600
each other that's not a bad idea what I

381
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,800
don't understand like state lines and

382
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,779
how they have different laws like you

383
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,579
can buy sparklers or fireworks somewhere

384
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,440
and then drive it somewhere else all

385
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,579
about who's running the town because we

386
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,579
were all right

387
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:36,240
we stopped at a gas station and they

388
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,160
were selling like fireworks and

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
sparklers I get different states for

390
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,100
sure different cities is what throws a

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
wrench in my plan

392
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,120
not original not in your airplane in

393
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,120
like a lot a lot of people like your

394
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,519
mind pick your thoughts yeah it throws a

395
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,860
monkey it throws a monkey wrench in my

396
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,320
banana in my banana pudding

397
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,600
I like that like I like the monkey

398
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,339
wrench thing meter maid got to be one of

399
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,540
the like goofiest jobs ever it's kind of

400
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,040
it's like you imagine telling someone

401
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,380
you're a meter maid

402
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,199

yeah it just sounds like you're taunted

406
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I also think every single time we met

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,139
Chris at the airport which is pretty

408
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,540
frequently because we technically live

409
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,680
in two places I make fun of the pilots

410
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,600
while they're walking through the

411
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,820

this guy's got speed this guy's got a

427
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,060
bus I'm worried what's going on yeah I'm

428
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,680
really scared whenever whenever anyone's

429
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,959
running with like a backpack it freaks

430
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,660
me out because you never know well he's

431
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,880
running with like a button-up shirt

432
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,320
khakis oh he's finally running up he's

433
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,420
running into the groceries oh what's

434
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,220
that [ __ ] oh he's going into the

435
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,380
grocery store oh they close in two

436
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,880
minutes oh he must have really needed

437
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,339
something everyone take a guess what he

438
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
needed milk but the way he's running it

439
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,399
looks like he's gonna miss something for

440
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,660
dinner no it looks like he's starving to

441
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,279
death right now and yes he's got like

442
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,480
30. no if it was this important he'd be

443
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,380
running to the hospital like it's

444
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,380
probably just gonna be like I don't

445
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,760
think he's even running Nick what dude I

446
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,079
don't even think he's running to get to

447
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,579
the store fast I honestly just think

448
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,199
he's one of those weirdos that like run

449
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,699
in the hallways at school but like never

450
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,160
slow down Nick used to run through the

451
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,019
hallways not true yeah not true I

452
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,180
remember

453
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,579
not true yes it is not true yes it is

454
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,100
not true not true and the reason I can

455
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,660
tell you why the one weird thing I

456
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,779
remember doing is I had one of those

457
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,180
like satchel bags like oh yeah the the

458
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,279
half the crossbody ones it was it was

459
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,679
actually kind of lit no it wasn't I

460
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,179
liked it I would have dude I really I

461
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,980
really hate I feel like talked about

462
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,380
this before but I hate that I was like

463
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,939
embarrassed of like bringing lunch box

464
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,380
to school hold on because I would always

465
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,059
just be hungry all day can I bring

466
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,240
something up real quick what we're in a

467
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,500
car video dude say what you want I think

468
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:25,100
there needs to be some type of middle

469
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,100
ground for like I think men need purses

470
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,720
women don't really have pockets well

471
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,200
nowadays people do like crossbody bags

472
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,660
they got backpacks I feel like bagware

473
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,460
is huge I agree it's a major way of

474
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,559
accessorizing I'm ripping the same

475
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,020
background do you have any nice bags I

476
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,940
actually have a purse technically do you

477
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,440
the black bag that I carry around oh I

478
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,780

479
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,720
like I want like your bag like I like

480
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:57,720

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,660
unentertaining not true

484
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,299

entertained it's just that I had it it's

488
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,240

Dr Orange right they were the teachers

499
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,360

501
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,900

to run to and he turned the corner right

505
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,360
as she was running and he couldn't do

506
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,820

the the guy was running the guy was

541
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,580
