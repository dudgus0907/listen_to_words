1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
I first of all I strongly believe that

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,400
every kid uh every child should learn

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,759
coding. We should actually teach them

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,080
coding in school in the same way that we

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,679
teach them physics and geography and uh

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,679
you know literacy and math and whatn

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
not. Those are all fundamental skills.

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,119
Coding is one such skill because

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
software is everywhere and in fact our

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,880
day-to-day is dominated by software

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
already. You can't really live your life

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,960
travel um wake up in the morning without

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,279
software anymore. And I think as as

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
humans it is crucial to not only be in

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,519
readonly mode but also be able to create

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
uh things ourselves or at least

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
understand how how creation is done on

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
these devices. My name is Thomas and I'm

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,840
a developer. I've been developing uh

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
software since the early 1990s and today

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
my role is mostly being the GitHub CEO

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,040
leading uh the largest developer

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,040
platform uh on this planet.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
I was born in uh 1978 in East Berlin

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,280
when Germany was divided into two

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
countries. So I was on the on the

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
eastern side uh in Berlin in in a suburb

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,000
called Matsan. I grew you know had a

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,720
normal childhood um but was fascinated

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
by technology remote control cars uh uh

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,119
you know little computer games. Uh in

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,880
1989 the wall fell and and that opened

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,360
up you know a whole new world to me as

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
an 11year-old. um obviously from from a

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
toy perspective um getting access to to

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
Lego and and Mickey Mouse but also uh to

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
uh to computers and so in the early 90s

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,560
um I bought my first computer uh 64 and

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
after um university um I went to

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
technical university in Berlin I

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,479
actually uh went into the automotive

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
industry uh I started working at uh

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,079
Mercedes back then it was called Dameler

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,720
Chrysler working on driver assistance

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,799
system uh for for the S-Class and I did

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,520
that uh for a while and then switched to

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,280
the supplier side to Bosch uh uh which

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,960
is you know a large automotive supplier

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
amongst amongst other things and and

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,079
there uh worked you know on parking

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,840
systems and it was in 2008 uh that two

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,640
things happened. One is I finished my

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,640
PhD thesis but also Steve Jobs showed

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
the iPhone SDK. Everybody wanted to

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
build apps um and and at the time only

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
Apple could build native apps and I

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
thought this is this is cool. I got to,

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
you know, build apps myself and I got to

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
get into that space. And so I quit my

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
job at Bosch uh at the height of the

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
financial crisis amongst all things uh

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,640
in late 2008 and um reconnected with a

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
friend um from from university and um we

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
just became you know two freelance

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,080
developers building apps uh for the

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
German market. So mostly agency work or

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,120
or subcontractor for for larger app

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,280
projects. I think in in 2009 and 10 we

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,360
built around 30 apps. That work on

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
building apps um for for for mostly

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
German customers um German enterprise

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
customers media and and automotive and

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,080
so on got us the idea of of building a

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,720
platform for mobile app developers. And

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,800
so we um together with three friends

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
Stefan Andreas and and Michael we

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
founded a company called Hockey App

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
which was a platform for mobile app

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,480
developers. you could distribute your

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
beta builds and um collect uh error

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,319
reports, crash reports and feedback and

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
those kind of things. And so we built

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,800
that startup you know the platform for

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
our own you know freelance business

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
because we had that painoint that we

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
wanted to solve uh for ourselves. Um

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,480
because it was before that you would

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,920
send you know a build uh over email you

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
know to to a project manager um in

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,959
Berlin or so and then the project

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
manager would take that build and send

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,400
it to the customer and explain to them

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
or you have to you know drag and drop

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
that into iTunes and connect you know uh

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,720
uh the dock cable and and all these kind

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,319
of things. since we made that way easier

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
which made our own life easier and I

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,519
think those are some of the greatest

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
startup ideas when you're using it

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,159
yourself uh uh day in day out and then

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
improving it um based on the feedback

102
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,959
that you're getting from your own

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
customers. So we basically started

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
building out the the hockey app business

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,040
while we had the the contracting

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,120
business and they were companies um both

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
about the same size and um when

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,080
Microsoft came in in 2014, we thought

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,440
they would only buy the hockey air

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
platform and the product business and

111
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,000
and leave the contracting business alone

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
uh given there were existing customer uh

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
contracts and and what have you. uh but

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
in fact Microsoft bought both companies

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
uh the the subsidiary the product

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,400
company and the the mothership the the

117
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
contracting company because the

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,720
contracting company had a number of iOS

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,760
and Android developers uh that were a

120
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,560
hot commodity uh in 2014 and and hard to

121
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,479
hire um certainly you know at at startup

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
rates and so Microsoft actually took

123
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,600
over both of those companies and uh a

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,000
fun funny story is today of these 11

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,639
employees seven including myself work

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
for GitHub and so different paths Um uh

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,160
they all got to Microsoft and then from

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
Microsoft into GitHub. You know coming

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,759
from a small company of of our size

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,240
based in Germany in Stutka Germany,

131
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,240
southwest Germany. Uh moving you know

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,720
halfway around the world I moved with my

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
wife and back then two very young kids

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,919
uh to Seattle that alone was a big

135
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,040
change. And looking back now um 10 years

136
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,040
later and we moved we moved in in early

137
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,759
2015 it feels all like a blur like

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
things moved so fast and sometimes I

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
don't even realize how we did all that.

140
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,400
Our startup was very small and

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
bootstrapped um for the whole time. So

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,039
we never took any outside investment uh

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,600
until Microsoft acquired us and at that

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,919
point in time I think it was about 11 or

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
or 12 employees. a still very small

146
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,720
team. all of all of engineers, you know,

147
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,400
building building the product together

148
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,639
and in some ways you know my role today

149
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,360
as GitHub CEO um is very similar uh in

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,320
that you know um my developer skills uh

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,560
my understanding of code my um you know

152
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
empathy for for how software developers

153
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,600
work helped me both with my you know

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
internal team of about a thousand uh

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
engineers and with our customer base

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
which are also all software developers

157
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
or those that aspire to become software

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
developer And so I think you know a lot

159
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,400
of the you know my passion for software

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,039
development is actually perfect you know

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,039
for me being being the GitHub

162
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,960
CEO I don't think I've seen anything

163
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,880
more exciting and and and changing how

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,919
uh we think about software development

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,280
in my in my 30 plus year career as a

166
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,160
software developer. You know, when I

167
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,240
started coding in the early 1990s, uh

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
there wasn't even the internet or I I

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
certainly had no internet access and so

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,919
I had to figure it all out all out all

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
by myself with with books, with

172
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,240
magazines, um going to computer club in

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,160
the community center kind of hoping that

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
somebody will be there. Um if we fast

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,880
forward to where we are now is that it's

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,160
so much easier to get into into software

177
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,720
development. you can, you know, just

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,680
write a prompt into Copilot or or Chat

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,160
GPT or or similar tools and it uh will

180
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,280
likely write you um um you know, a basic

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,039
web page um or a small uh application, a

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,800
game uh in Python. And so AI makes

183
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,720
software development uh so much more

184
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
accessible um for anyone who wants to

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,919
learn coding. And on the other side of

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,400
the spectrum, it makes developers so

187
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,280
much more productive. Most uh developers

188
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,039
that uh work on a project have way uh

189
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,280
too much work to do. uh they have long

190
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,440
backlogs um of their own ideas of

191
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
customer feedback, you know, uh things

192
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
that they're hearing from their managers

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,240
or from the market or what they're

194
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,240
seeing at competitors. And so almost any

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
software project that has a certain, you

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,479
know, age um has way too much work on

197
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,479
the innovation side, but they also have

198
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,560
what we call technical debt. Uh you

199
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
know, legacy code, things that have, you

200
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
know, been created over over months or

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
years that need a cleanup, that need

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
what we call refactoring. And so

203
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,520
engineers constantly balance those two

204
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
backlogs. So having something that

205
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,400
brings the effort down and makes them

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,520
you know 10% 20% maybe even 50% more

207
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,680
productive is is completely changing uh

208
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,759
how software developers work. the role

209
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,520
of GitHub you know in this in the first

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
uh let's say you know five years of the

211
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,520
age of AI um given that we started

212
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,120
working on GitHub copilot in uh June

213
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,280
2020 right after uh GP3 uh uh was was

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,599
first shown to the world is that we want

215
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,479
to be you know on the forefront um of uh

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,039
AI code generation we want to provide um

217
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,840
tools to developer to be more productive

218
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,919
and more happy uh when when writing code

219
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,240
because the reality is the dream I think

220
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,360
for most developers that start their

221
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,199
their journey um uh as a programmer is

222
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
that they have an idea in their head and

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,599
they're trying to find a way how they

224
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,759
can can get the fastest from that idea

225
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
to an app or or web page or service,

226
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
right? Like the challenge is not that

227
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,599
developers uh uh don't have enough

228
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,360
ideas. The challenge is that you take

229
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,879
that big idea and you have to break it

230
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
down into small building blocks. And as

231
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
you're working on the first block or the

232
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,640
first module or the first class or uh

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,800
micros service, whatever it is, you're

234
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,360
you're realizing that this this idea

235
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,039
that you have is so much more complex to

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
implement than than you thought. And so

237
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,720
from what became a weekend project, it

238
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
becomes a month-long or sometimes

239
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,600
year-long project. And many, you know,

240
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
apps that, uh, I wrote as a teenager and

241
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
I know, you know, many of my friends and

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
and my employees wrote never get

243
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,320
anywhere because you you ultimately

244
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
realize it's much more complex than you

245
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
thought and it's not worth spending the

246
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
time on it. And in in the world that we

247
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
live today, you can always, you know,

248
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
download an app from the app store or

249
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,320
find, you know, some online service that

250
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
does the same thing. So, I think AI

251
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,560
helps us, you know, to realize the dream

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
of taking an idea and implementing it

253
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
much faster. And you see um some of the

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
early signs of that where very small

255
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,320
startups sometimes you know five

256
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720
developers um and some of them actually

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
only one developers uh uh believe they

258
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
can become million uh if not billion

259
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,360
dollar businesses by leveraging all the

260
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,600
AI agents uh that are available to them

261
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,519
and maybe building their own uh to to

262
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
write code uh to write software much

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
faster. Now the flip side of that is

264
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
that you know uh I don't think we're

265
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
anywhere close to a world where you can

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,200
just write a single prompt and say build

267
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,360
GitHub and then an AI agent builds all

268
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,680
of the features of GitHub um or even

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,760
just the very basic primitives like

270
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,800
repository storage you know git storage

271
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,519
and uh issue tracking um because the the

272
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,360
decisions um that we as developers as

273
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
engineers as product managers have to

274
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
make to build a complex system like

275
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,600
GitHub you know thousands if not tens of

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
thousands decisions um there's the

277
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
simple ones, right? Like which

278
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,160
programming language, which which open

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,160
source framework, which cloud to use or

280
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,080
do we even use a cloud, which operating

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
system and and so on. But there's the

282
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,399
much more complex decisions of how you

283
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,240
architect the system, you know, are you

284
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
building a monolith and or you building

285
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,920
microservices? And getting to a point

286
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
where agents can make all these

287
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,680
decisions and write an app that actually

288
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
is a viable business, you know, finds

289
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
product market fit, has a great user

290
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,079
experience, and and ultimately generates

291
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
both revenue and profit. uh because any

292
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
business at some point has to get to the

293
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
place where they're making profit and

294
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
and return that profit to the to the

295
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
founders or shareholders that I think

296
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,399
we're we're quite far away and so we

297
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
need uh engineers uh to do engineering

298
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,360
stuff. They they need to exercise their

299
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,519
craft and uh apply systems thinking and

300
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,519
design and and and build really great

301
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,519
applications.

302
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,000
I think the unique thing about GitHub is

303
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,880
its size and both the love uh that

304
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,760
developers have for you know our brand

305
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,959
um for our mascot um the octoat or we

306
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,360
call it internally Mona um and um the

307
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,600
reputation uh that GitHub has created

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,680
for itself um since the very early days

309
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
since the I remember the early launch of

310
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,000
GitHub and and meeting um or seeing um

311
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,040
Chris one of the founders speaking at

312
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,560
RailsCon in in Las Vegas in in 2009 and

313
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,279
then signing up for my own account and

314
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,160
and started using it. I I was excited

315
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,839
about using GitHub and now we are in in

316
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,240
2025 and there are still many people

317
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,720
that uh love GitHub but you know what

318
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,720
what comes with love is also that you're

319
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,839
not holding back your criticism and that

320
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,000
we have 150 million users and uh on the

321
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,320
platform and so there's at least you

322
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,079
know a million opinions of what are the

323
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
things we should invest on and what's

324
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,279
working well and and what's not working

325
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
well and what's the one feature that is

326
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,320
important you know to that set of users

327
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,079
while it's not important uh to to me and

328
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
and my product leadership team because

329
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,240
we have you know our own uh strategy and

330
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
decisions to make. So filtering out the

331
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,040
signal from the noise and I don't mean

332
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,200
noise in any negative way just so much

333
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
feedback that we're getting. I remember

334
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
when we when we did the acquisition in

335
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
2018 and I joined GitHub and afterwards

336
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,880
um we sent an email to 10 GitHub users

337
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
and say hey we we're looking into a new

338
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,079
project we would love your feedback. I

339
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,760
think we got nine responses of exciting

340
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,000
users saying if you want to I want to

341
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,839
provide feedback. If you do that in many

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
other companies and startups you get one

343
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,440
response and the one response is kind of

344
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,279
like well I have like 10 minutes time to

345
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,839
to give you some feedback. There's just

346
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,160
so much um uh uh information that's

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,000
that's coming back to us um on on social

348
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,440
media and our platform in email and

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,040
support tickets and so on. The second

350
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
piece you know that comes to mind is

351
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,519
that GitHub um for the longest time has

352
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,680
been a company with a very strong remote

353
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,160
culture like long before co uh the

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,800
GitHub founders started hiring um

355
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,959
developers uh sales folks support folks

356
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,040
all over the world and today I think

357
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,959
we're one of the largest remote only

358
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,320
companies where all work you know from

359
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,959
our homes or from you know hotel in in

360
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,360
soul um or from from wherever we are and

361
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,200
so a lot of um our culture is focused

362
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
around GitHub as a platform form which

363
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,040
obviously through open source encourages

364
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,320
um uh asynchronous uh collaboration uh

365
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,839
and then tools like Slack um um and and

366
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,000
video video calls um uh that we use much

367
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,160
more heavily internally than we're using

368
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
email like like old school uh companies

369
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,160
do. And so when I wake up in the morning

370
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,560
especially here you know in Seoul uh

371
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,440
which is like lots of time zones away uh

372
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,360
from from the US uh where about 80% of

373
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,480
our employee population is is that I

374
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,480
wake up to 30 40 Slack messages plus you

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
know uh uh hundreds of channels uh with

376
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
with conversation and then figuring out

377
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
you know what is actually important for

378
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,560
me as CEO what what to react to what can

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,040
I snooze uh for a while and what can I

380
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,959
just ignore that that's the you know a

381
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,279
big part of my job but it's also so

382
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,920
exciting because you know, I can be here

383
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,160
in South Korea um at at this event and

384
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,680
and still still run the company. And a

385
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,440
lot of, you know, what we do on a

386
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
day-to-day basis doesn't actually matter

387
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,800
whether I'm here in Seoul, or whether

388
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm in Berlin or whether in I'm in New

389
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,639
York or anywhere else in the world. And

390
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,560
and I think that's for for many hubbers,

391
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
how we call our employees. A really

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,959
strong part of our culture that we are

393
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,440
remote company. Uh it's not related to

394
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,360
the pandemic. It's a choice that we made

395
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
of how we want to run the company. you

396
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,440
know how we select GitHub as an employer

397
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
and ultimately how we believe we can be

398
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,600
successful. I first of all I strongly

399
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,120
believe that every kid uh every child

400
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
should learn coding and we should

401
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
actually teach them coding in school in

402
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
the same way that we teach them physics

403
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
and geography and uh you know literacy

404
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,399
and math and whatnot. Those are all

405
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
fundamental skills. Coding is one such

406
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,000
skill and it just has taken us too long

407
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
to actually realize that because

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
software is everywhere. Um hardware is

409
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
also everywhere. We carry we carry both

410
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,839
software and hardware with us uh through

411
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,440
our day. And in fact our day-to-day is

412
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,240
dominated by software already. You can't

413
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,760
really uh live your life uh travel um

414
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,320
wake up in the morning without software

415
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,959
anymore. And I think as as humans it is

416
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,360
crucial to not only be in read only mode

417
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,360
but also be able to create uh things

418
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,040
ourselves or at least understand how how

419
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
creation is done on these devices. That

420
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,399
doesn't mean that every you know 18

421
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
19year-old when they leave high school

422
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,639
become a software developer. In the same

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,240
way that not every uh uh kid that learns

424
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,839
physics or or chemistry in school

425
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,279
becomes a physicist, right? Just because

426
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
you learn those fundamental skills

427
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,079
doesn't mean that you decide for

428
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,839
yourself that that's the career path to

429
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,440
take. So that's number one. You you got

430
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,839
to you got to learn coding. I think

431
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,639
number number two is you got to use AI

432
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,639
to do that. And and you know whether

433
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,199
it's here in Korea or in Germany uh most

434
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,120
kids um uh and in fact you know most

435
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,800
most people don't speak fluent English

436
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
um which is the primary language of

437
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
software development. And so it

438
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
democratizes access to technology and

439
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
that's true for many other uh things in

440
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,079
the world. And so having uh an agent

441
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,000
available uh that answers you any

442
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,079
question but also lets you you know

443
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,680
realize your dream building your dream

444
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,519
uh is incredibly exciting. And then the

445
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,440
third thing you know for anyone who is

446
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
already a software developer or wants to

447
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
you know develop their craft is you got

448
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
to keep you got to keep rehearsing. You

449
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,560
got to keep training. Yeah. You got to

450
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,240
keep learning. There's you're never done

451
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
with learning. If I look back 30 years

452
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
of what development looked like back

453
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
then and what it looks like now, um I

454
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,759
would have been, you know, um very

455
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,560
behind if I hadn't constantly read blog

456
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,880
posts, um uh literature and and tried

457
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,560
out things myself. So I think those are

458
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,639
uh as as crucial as they were in the '

459
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,920
90s, they are still crucial in 2025. You

460
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
just have so much more access to

461
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,399
information uh to become, you know, top

462
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,399
of the

463
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,360
field. The obvious answer is that I most

464
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,160
enjoy using GitHub Copi, right? like

465
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,240
that's our product. Uh it's our baby. Uh

466
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,800
we're working on this day in day out. I

467
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,959
often, you know, uh see features long

468
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
before the world sees that. And and the

469
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
flip side is also true that I often

470
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,920
don't actually know what's shipped

471
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,720
versus what is, you know, in in preview

472
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,160
or in in internal ships. And so I'm

473
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,839
daily excited about what we're building

474
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,000
there and I'm using a lot of that myself

475
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
as I am at heart a developer. And

476
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
sometimes it's very simple, you know,

477
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,839
asking it to to write me a quick script

478
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
that that downloads, you know, ids of

479
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,160
all our repositories um from our API.

480
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,679
And in the past, I would have gone, you

481
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
know, to our API documentation and

482
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,199
figure that out all myself and probably

483
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,160
would have taken me like half an hour to

484
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,000
to get to, you know, a shell script that

485
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
does that. Today, I just ask Copil and

486
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,079
it writes me the script and it works

487
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,919
within within minutes. Um, and I think

488
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,520
actually that's the one of the true

489
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
superpowers of AI. Whether that's

490
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
learning to code or exploring the world,

491
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,600
you have um an assistant available to

492
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
you that has infinite patience. You

493
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
know, it doesn't judge you. Um, it will,

494
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
you know, chat GPT or co-pilot never

495
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,880
tells you what what a stupid question

496
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,559
is. It always gives you an answer and it

497
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
even accepts when you tell it it's wrong

498
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,160
or it needs to, you know, explore the

499
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,400
topic a little bit further. You know,

500
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
you have seen uh the prompt examples

501
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,240
where by telling it to outline its

502
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,799
thought process, it actually gets to a

503
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,799
better answer. I love using it for my

504
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,840
blog posts and PowerPoint presentation

505
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,240
to just uh generate some images and and

506
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,320
play with that. Um I'm I'm really bad at

507
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,480
using Photoshop and and and drawing

508
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,480
myself, but I'm I'm really creative and

509
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,240
I can write prompts and and figure out

510
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
how to rewrite the prompt to make the

511
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
image look more than uh more more

512
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
closely to what I had in my head.

513
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
There's, you know, tools that we're

514
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
using like teams copilot to summarize

515
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,640
meetings, especially when I I'm on

516
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,480
business trips like that. Um, where I

517
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
miss a lot of the meetings that happen

518
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,080
uh in on the west coast and west coast

519
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,160
time zone. Just getting a summary,

520
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,640
figuring out other action items for me.

521
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,320
Uh, same for summarizing emails. Um, uh,

522
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,160
you know, using something like reclaim

523
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,840
AI to to manage my calendar. Those

524
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,840
things are making me more productive.

525
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,840
And I think the really exciting thing is

526
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,240
that there's always a new tool to try

527
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,559
out and see is that how far along that

528
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
journey is AI and how much more do we

529
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,320
still have to do as an industry to

530
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,240
actually get to that to that dream of of

531
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,840
having an orchestra of agent uh that

532
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,039
that we're controlling during our

533
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,039
personal and in our professional lives.
