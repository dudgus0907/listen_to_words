124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,320
question

125
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,460

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,479

137
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,620
building evolving's the wrong word I

138
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,479

139
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,400
you think you have a stronger bond with

140
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,280
