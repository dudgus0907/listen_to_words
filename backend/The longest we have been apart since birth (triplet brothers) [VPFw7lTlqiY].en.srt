[Music]

it's just me

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,199
um this is really really weird but after

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,840
VidCon Matt and Chris went to Summer

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,220
Smash and I stayed in VidCon and went to

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,719
Disneyland for two days and then I

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,340
stayed home alone for two days while

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,640
they were in Chicago doing their thing

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,100
so now I'm finally going home to Boston

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm catching my flight in an hour hey

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,320
everyone me and Matt are in Boston

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,940
Massachusetts the Big B but I haven't

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
seen Minecraft in four days and it's the

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,320
longest we've been apart so I'm really

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
really confused by it like it's just

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
like a really bizarre feeling because

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,719
it's like literally since I was born

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
this is the longest I've been without

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,960
Matt and Chris but I'm excited to head

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,340
to Boston and I don't know what their

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,379
apps too but

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,240
I will see them soon happy that they're

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,180
in any random MC parking lot right now

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,460
back in their Mick Hometown making mixed

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,260
jokes and make content together back

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,380
where they make belong

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,060
it's like the good Mickle days anyway

32
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,080
the last three days me and Matt were in

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,180
Chicago

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,520
uh for summer Smash and Nick didn't come

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,920
and it always feels weird when one of us

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,259
isn't there and before because it's such

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
a rare citizen says that Nick didn't

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,180
come from his own well-being he didn't

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,340
want to be there himself that was his

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,659
decision nobody else's yeah bro he had

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,299
the time of his life just staying home

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,640
so Nick's flying we got VidCon in Disney

43
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,700
he wasn't even staying home no for real

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,220
I was out and about anyway me and Matt

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,420
been home for a day we landed this

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,939
morning and Nick comes in tomorrow

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,380
morning so we just thought it would be

48
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,240
funny since we didn't see him for a few

49
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,799
days that we're just gonna make make it

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,420
seem like we we're gonna make his return

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,119
seem like way big idea and Nick Nick

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,460
knowing him like this is the exact type

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,979
of [ __ ] that Nick absolutely hates he

54
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,020
hates scenes he hates anything that's

55
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,940
