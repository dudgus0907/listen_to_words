21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,120
not too explicit to point where we have

everyone in the world all at one moment

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,720
and then just tell them what I think

273
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,720
you'd be such a waste of a person to

274
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,240
speak at something like that oh my God I

275
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,279
cannot believe you I'm being honest oh I

276
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,600
don't have earrings in how upsetting if

277
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
the whole world was paying attention to

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,519
yeah but if the whole world was paying

279
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,120
attention to one person and they had

280
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,040
something to say you were probably the

281
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,279
last person I would pick to speak do you

282
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,480
want know what I do what you probably

283
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:09,279

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,639
tell everyone in the world to go do

290
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,839
something it's going to be one of two

291
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,399
things go watch our YouTube channel or

292
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,959
Veno me a [ __ ] dollar cuz then I'd be

293
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,440
a billionaire I'd probably just do like

294
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,720
a jig I go like

295
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,360
this we should get a white panel van

296
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,519
instead of this what does Matt choose to

297
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,880
be quiet or does Matt just not have

298
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,519
anything ridiculous to say I think

299
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,639
that's a good thing you talk a lot when

300
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,760
we're not filming I think you got camera

301
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,560
yeah cuz you talk a lot when we are

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,000
notice how that works I talk a lot all

303
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,600
the time yeah and I talk a lot when I

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,920
feel like it what unconventional animal

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,760

309
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,760
obtainable like on a weird listen I want

310
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,000
to be able to like teach them and train

311
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,839
them that the blow of a whistle like and

312
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,600
and a clap like a and then I'm going to

313
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,680
lay flat on the ground and 100 hamsters

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,519
are going to run at me and pick my body

315
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,079
up and then they're going to quickly why

316
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,920
I have nothing to say

317
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,160
and 100 hamsters are just going to drag

318
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,440
me into a

319
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,000
room like I want to I want to be

supposed to say things and I'm going to

322
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
have it's it's it's either this guy

just likeed to how many hamsters do you

327
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,040
think it would take to do that and not I

328
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,279
would pick you up a million a million I

329
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
don't know I say I was going to say

330
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,399
let's just say hypothetically you fell

331
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,680
on 100 hamsters I think they're all dead

332
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,920
I agree you think I'd kill my petite

333
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,040
body would kill a 100 hamsters I don't I

334
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,880
I think it wouldn't distribute the

335
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,959
weight properly what no I think you

336
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,800
would if you fell on like a bucket of

337
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,560
100 hamsters I think you're clearing 80

338
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,199
of them at least I don't I can't think

339
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,720

340
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,320

341
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,480

342
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,120
what I want probably like a safe bed is

343
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,920
