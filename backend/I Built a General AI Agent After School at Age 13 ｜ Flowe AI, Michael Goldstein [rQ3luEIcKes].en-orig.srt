1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
The school doesn't like AI. They don't

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,240
really allow it technically. But what I

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
think is over the past few years,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
there's been the rise of AI products.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
Naturally, over the past couple years,

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,599
we all use AI on a daily basis at school

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,240
like notes sometimes or for like general

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,199
answers. And I think the rise of AI like

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
in schools like uh try CBT and those

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,199
types of things. I think that also kind

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,480
of inspired me to do flow because it

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,359
opened up a new bridge. My name is

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,360
Michael and I'm the founder of Flow AI.

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,680
Over the past few months, I've been

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
building something by Lucer, a general

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
AI agent that actually gets things done.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,239
From booking flights to cancel

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,879
subscriptions to making presentations,

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,120
Flo can do it all. This is one step

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,120
closer to AGI and a glimpse of the

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,120
future.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,000
Um, my name is Michael Goldstein. I'm 13

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,239
years old. Uh I live in Toronto, Canada.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm the founder of Flow AI. Flowey is a

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,280
general AI agent. So it's an agent that

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
can do a wide variety of tasks, not only

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,119
one certain thing. So a couple months

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,799
ago, I had the idea and I reached out to

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,880
multiple developers to ask if they

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,560
wanted to help. And none of them really

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
said yes. I don't know, probably because

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
my age and a bunch of other things. So I

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
started building it myself using like a

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,640
bunch of AI tools to help. Um so I also

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,720
I do coding lessons now every week so I

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960
can in the future do it myself. No help

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,640
from anyone right now. I'm actually like

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
a paying user. Someone else said I

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,000
should do normal a normal kid life. But

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,000
what I think is just build build

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,759
like I have a group of friends right

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,320
like our little bubble and we all are

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,799
kind of have a similar spirit for

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,880
entrepreneur. So, a project we did and

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
still do more of is weather balloon

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,360
launches. Um, and those are really big

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,079
balloons that go to 100,000 ft and then

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,319
come back down. And the first one was on

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,000
CNN. Yeah. For the solar eclipse, we did

50
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,959
it during there. And I think it's fun to

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,680
see it actually working. So, my friends,

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,400
they they they know I have this a

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
spirit. So, they weren't that surprised.

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,599
And I think my family, I think it's the

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,280
same. My family knows that I have this

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,720
type of spirit. Uh so I think um they

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
weren't surprised also when I launched

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,120
it. They were very excited and happy and

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
I don't know if they expected it to work

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,319
also.

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,200
I had extracted all the emails of users

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,440
from Subbase and I sent an email to

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,599
everyone giving them everyone a discount

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
and I woke up and I got a response from

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,040
one person who was saying the code

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,080
wasn't working.

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
Um, so I had to fix that glitch and I

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
responded and then I got the message

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,319
from Stripe. I got my first sale. It

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,640
happened when I was walking downstairs.

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,519
Um, so I was very excited. I told all my

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,280
friends and family and parents. So I ran

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,840
into my parents room. I was like, "Ah, I

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,840
made it. Yay."

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,800
So uh, my experience has been good, I

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
guess. Um, of course there's advantages

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,599
like when I when I posted the launch

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,159
video that did pretty well and I bet my

79
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,239
age was a factor of that. A lot of

80
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,720
people are also more curious because I'm

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,080
younger. Uh, so I think it opens up a

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
lot more opportunities like this

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
interview for example. I don't know if

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
it would have happened if I was much

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,879
older. Um, so a lot of opportunities

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,760
open up when I'm younger. Uh, like

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,000
Founders Inc. also that's a very big

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,040
accomplishment also. Um I'm the youngest

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,920
accepted there. Also I was invited to a

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,720
summit in Paris, one of the top AI

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,640
summits. So that was that was something

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,599
that happened from the interview. And

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,360
the disadvantages are probably

94
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,280
um it's hard to get people to trust you

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,640
also. So on top of the advantages that

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
some people don't really trust me, for

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,560
example. And I guess like I mentioned

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,079
earlier, uh recruiting is really hard um

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,519
when you're much younger because I have

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,600
no capital, right? I guess my birthday

101
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
money, right? So I think that was the

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
hardest part. It took a couple of months

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,639
before I could recruit two developers

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
and one guy who does who helps with

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,120
strategy. They actually reached out to

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
me first, all three of them. Uh they all

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
reached out saying they're interested

108
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
and they would love to help. uh right I

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,960
reached out to a lot of adults and

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
mentors and all types of people to help

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,840
and a lot of them helped. So I think I

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,479
have to give back to everyone not just

113
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,479
them but everyone.

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
We're all interested in AI. Uh we all

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
use AI on a daily basis at school. Uh I

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,759
think not only my friends I think the

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,160
whole everyone at school all the kids

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,320
now use AI. So I think we're all

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,080
interested in in it in terms of my

120
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
friends and the school. There's a lot of

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,639
AI tools available but I really think we

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,560
only use one main one which is CHBT. I

123
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
think a lot of kids at school don't know

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
about the other tools and I think you

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
have to be more involved in AI to know

126
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,120
the other tools. So yeah I think most of

127
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,520
the school or the kids or my friends are

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,400
using child only which is unfortunate.

129
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Um only recently really is when I really

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,360
learned in depth about AI and how it

131
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,880
works and for the idea of flow it came

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,880
when I when I realized that there's a

133
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,720
big gap and that there was something

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,600
that wasn't being done which is

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
automated tasks. Uh I think it it can

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
really help humans with efficiency. uh

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
like my parents for example, we all

138
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,120
waste time filling out forms. But I

139
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
think that's the biggest one because

140
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,000
there's not many platforms that are

141
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,960
doing that like claw doesn't do that or

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,400
open AAI. I think that's the biggest gap

143
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,880
that there is. It's the browser

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,639
automation. So I think in general by

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,720
next year I hope to have many more

146
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
features in it and I hope for it to be

147
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
more smooth of course because there's

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,319
many many bugs still which is uh going

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,960
to be fixed over time and that I think

150
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,520
in terms of more of the money type. I

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
set a goal on Twitter for $10,000 in

152
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,479
recur monthly recurring revenue and it

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
might take plenty of years. I'm not sure

154
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,639
how long it will take but I hope in a

155
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,360
year we can get somewhere close to that.

156
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,400
So I hope Floy is able to you know

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,840
become part of everyone's life almost

158
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,440
right um I think the goal that you'll be

159
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,240
able to do that can be automated right

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,800
we get to see how AI evolves and that

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,199
kind of stuff I think the longterm goal

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,400
for me is in some way to help people you

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,400
know give back Almost.
