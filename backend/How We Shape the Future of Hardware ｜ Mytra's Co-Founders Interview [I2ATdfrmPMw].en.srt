1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
actually the advice I would give to

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,279
people trying to create their own

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,440
company really work in the field a

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,280
little bit like work in the field you

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,799
think you have an idea for some new

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,199
service or product work in that field

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,199
and get insight that's something I got

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,160
out of my Stanford experience you maybe

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,720
you have an idea of what's really

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,080
valuable and useful as a product but the

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,279
best approach to creating value is first

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,240
that you get insight into what the

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,760
problem is my name's Chris qualty I'm

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,480
the CEO and co-founder of Mitra we're a

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
2-year-old company based out of South

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,879
San Francisco a little bit about my

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,079
background before starting Mitra I was

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,800
at Tesla for 7 and A2 years before Tesla

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
I had various positions in renewable

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,800
energy and Consulting I was electrical

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,719
engineer undergrad but at Tesla I joined

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,520
to lead product and hardware for the

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,559
supercharger team and I launched various

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,680
products like paid supercharging and my

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,159
name is Ahmed Bal I am the CTO and

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,600
co-founder and Mitra Mitra is building

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,600
robots for warehouse material flow of

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,640
trying to solve a fundamental problem

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,200
with theerror flow in in warehousing

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,200
Logistics and Manufacturing as

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,840
well so I joined Tesla in 2014 I think

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,840
this is after the dual motor b s was

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,600
launched or was announced you know

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,159
there's a lot of skepticism are electric

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,280
vehicles going to be successful is fully

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
battery electric vehicle or plug in

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,159
hybrid you know Tesla versus Fisker a

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,840
lot of uncertainty in the market then

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,119
but you know I joined Tesla to to solve

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,360
a very clear problem I was working on

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,240
more traditional wield Automation and of

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,840
course a lot of the fixed infrastructure

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,680
projects that we had a tuss it

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,719
beforehand and then you know this

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,880
challenge of let's build a humanoid

46
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,920
robot was was given to our team because

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,640
we had an integrated robotics team but

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,880
the challenges of a humanoid are are

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
very different than building a wheeled

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,960
robot on the floor legged Locomotion

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,200
grasping and manipulation the kinds of

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,440
of of decisions that this robot has to

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,640
process a perception systems are are

54
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,560
wildly different and so first Tesla had

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,480
precisely zero expertise of humanoid

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,280
robotics at the time so I had to go and

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,400
figure out who the experts were meet

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,440
with them try to establish a recruiting

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,920
pipeline try to find the internal

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,800
experts within Tesla who were willing

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,879
and able and also had the foundational

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,920
skill sets to be able to solve this

63
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,840
problem I had to get myself a two month

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,280
crash course in human orotic so that was

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,440
really an interesting time but you know

66
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,519
I think one of the things that Tesla

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,239
teaches you to be very resourceful that

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,000
wasn't the first time I've been asked to

69
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,080
solve the problem which I had no really

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,480
like deep or meaningful background in

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
but you structure the problem you go

72
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,680
find the information you need hop on a

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,319
plane to meet with the experts as you

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,239
need you do what it takes to to figure

75
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,760
it out you know neon laid a mandate out

76
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,000
that we needed to get a some robot

77
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,400
walking in three months it's so between

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,319
internal experts talking with some some

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,799
folks out outside the company with to to

80
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,760
get accomplish that goal I think as a

81
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,319
whole though all robots are not created

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,080
equal all robot challenges are not equal

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,480
anytime you're talking about Led

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,519
Locomotion or just Advanced grasping the

85
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,799
perception that the type of data and the

86
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
consistency of data the frequency of the

87
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,040
refresh rates like I'm not just looking

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,280
at a hand like I need to understand like

89
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,000
the forces and yeah there's there's

90
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,239
literally infinite ways I could grab

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
something the difficulty of of repeating

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,920
that and making that some sort of

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,360
industrial process is many orders of

94
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,000
magnitude more difficult than just

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,040
driving a bot around the floor of a

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,400
factory and you know if we think about

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,920
how difficult it has been to do full

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,040
self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
you know you could argue that that

100
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,239
problem is not a solved problem yet

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,400
because we don't have ubiquitous cars no

102
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,360
driving highways and and surface streets

103
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,400
yet right you do have companies that are

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,680
driving like you can walk outside of

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,239
this building you will see a car

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,079
unmanned car drive by this this facility

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,280
probably in 30 minutes but it's not

108
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,239
ubiquitous right hasn't been adopted

109
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,400
building a humanoid to operate at full

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,400
scale in Factory or a home at the

111
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,439
comparable productivity of a human is a

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,759
very very challenging problem to solve

113
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,759
I'm confident it will be solved I think

114
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,759
the timing is everything right is this a

115
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,880
one-year problem is this a 5year is this

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,759
a 10e is this a 30-year problem unclear

117
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,680
so after spending a year there it was

118
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
it's a fascinating problem where again

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,320
was able to work with some of the best

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,039
and brightest at Tesla and and Beyond

121
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,039
Tesla was fortunate to be able to to

122
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,479
hire some wonderful people to work on

123
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,759
these huge challenges but ultimately I

124
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,759
join Tesla to ship you know millions of

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320
products to the public to make real

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,400
impacts and I felt that most of the

127
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
impact by the humanoid is dependent on

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,800
solving effectively some research

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
problems with what we're doing at Mitra

130
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,479
this is not in the research domain this

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
is a very like we're solving tangible

132
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,840
problems with technology that doesn't

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,400
require moonshot levels of of innovation

134
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,240
to have meaningful impact on the economy

135
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,560
after Tesla I I tried to just focus a

136
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,400
little bit away from manufacturer let me

137
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,680
think a little bit you know do something

138
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,840
else derivatives trading and try to

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,680
learn more about Ai and financial

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,280
systems but the bug of manufacturing

141
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,360
working on Hardware gotten me again and

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,720
the things I did at Tesla were very

143
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,199
applicable to rev and I thought I really

144
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,199
wanted to help one more us auto

145
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,960
manufacturer get off the brown I was

146
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,880
really excited about rivan trying to

147
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,400
help them out so I went and you know

148
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,680
spent time at rivian helping them scale

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,600
their manufacturing assistance as well

150
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,919
that's the journey after that I was at a

151
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
beach in Hawaii I still have the video

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,600
while I'm recording the beach and I was

153
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,360
going like wonderful this is great I'm

154
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,919
done I don't want to do anything else

155
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,600
I've solved every problem I want to

156
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,600
solve as I'm recording the video I get a

157
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,120
call from walty and he's asking me about

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,800
hey do you remember the problems we went

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,960
into Tesla during manufacturing let's

160
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,199
really solve it at the beginning I was

161
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,639
like I don't want to do this I don't

162
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,800
want to do manufacturing again I want to

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
be stay at the beach but the more we

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,479
talked about how we would solve the spot

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
go back to the fundamentals let's not

166
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,440
just build another automation company

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,880
let's do something completely different

168
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,199
the more we talked about it the more I

169
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,199
got excited because it's it wasn't just

170
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,160
another implementation it's a complete

171
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,400
rethink and that was very excited so I

172
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,919
said okay yes let's start this company

173
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,639
let's find the best people that we can

174
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,560
find from our Network and pack a this

175
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,960
B with the global Venture Capital volume

176
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,080
decreasing dramatically startup must

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,599
find a better way to stay informed of

178
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,319
investment sentiment to survive hi I'm

179
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,720
Si from you and we know that many of you

180
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,960
watching are startup Founders that's why

181
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,280
we have something to share with you guys

182
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,560
that's going to be helpful for you the

183
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,000
startup Capital annual report from

184
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,120
HubSpot for startups is their newest

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,400
report on where startup capitals are

186
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,879
flowing the metrics investors care about

187
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,599
the most when deciding on investing in a

188
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,720
startup and the best tech Stacks to help

189
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,560
you manage investor relations in

190
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,160
addition to the detailed surveys of 500

191
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,680
Founders I found an in-depth interview

192
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
with seasoned investors from sequia

193
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Capital HS with venters and more to be

194
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,199
especially interesting and packed with

195
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,039
insights the report is free to download

196
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,479
through the link in description

197
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,479
be sure to check it out and take your

198
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,000
startup to the next round and thanks to

199
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,000
hpot for sponsoring the

200
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,120
video so Mitra was founded because am on

201
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,840
and I having seen a lot of these

202
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,800
different types of challenges at Tesla

203
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,240
and rivan wanted to find a problem that

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,080
we could solve we uniquely positioned

205
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,479
knowledgeable to tackle but also was

206
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,240
just simply not being solved right you

207
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,400
think of the lowest hanging fruit in

208
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,360
your tree and again material flow is

209
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,720
most of the work across industry just

210
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,159
moving things around yet it's clearly

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,960
unsolved I can go out and buy an

212
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,560
industrial automation system to do

213
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,080
almost anything I need the problem is is

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,560
it cost effective is it simple is it

215
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,080
extensible is it flexible and we said if

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,560
we can design something that's just far

217
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,800
simpler iPhone's a great example Tesla

218
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,520
there's lots of great examples of

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,479
History where to follow a new scurve

220
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,879
scurve of adoption right a new tech

221
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,320
technology it starts off slowly it then

222
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,479
you know there's some acceleration then

223
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,760
it kind of tapers off but to truly

224
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,479
continue like linear adoption and

225
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Improvement of Technologies it's

226
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,320
comprised of a whole bunch of small

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,040
s-curves right we needed to create that

228
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,839
new s-curve for industrial aeration

229
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,760
there needed to be a new paradigm and to

230
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,080
do that again when you look across

231
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,959
history It's usually the simpler thing

232
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Waits how do we find the absolute

233
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,640
simplest way to do this work and what we

234
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,959
realized was that that no there is no

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,240
system that was designed that was

236
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,920
physically or kinematically

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,519
unconstrained meaning I want to move

238
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,320
things in 3D how do I move it up down

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,040
left right from any cell to any cell in

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
full 3d that was just an unsolved

241
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,600
problem at any payload weate so we

242
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
simulated said this is a solvable

243
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,480
problem and if we can do this we've

244
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,320
created a system that is of immense

245
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
value to the industry so that's uh

246
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,600
that's why we decided to tackle this

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,760
problem fundamentally the material

248
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,720
movement for warehouses and

249
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Manufacturing happens on pallets pallets

250
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,720
in my view are the uh red blood cell of

251
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,240
the global GDP everything that you see

252
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,920
around you has been on a pallet you know

253
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,880
the cameras are clothes or pieces of

254
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,240
furniture all of that has been on a pal

255
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,120
yet the pallet movement technology has

256
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,279
been the same for the past 100 years

257
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,959
it's a pallet it's generally the same

258
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,959
size it moves uh it's made out of wood

259
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,800
and it's moved with for CLI

260
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,000
operated by humans it's the same thing

261
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,160
and so there hasn't been an optimization

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,120
on that for quite some time and in our

263
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,399
experience when I worked with with wki

264
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,760
we saw that the biggest problem

265
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,079
hindering the manufacturing process was

266
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,360
just trying to move material from one

267
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,279
product with Factory to the other and we

268
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,800
were thinking well let's improve that

269
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,000
how can we build something that is super

270
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,360
simple if you were to look at the need

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,120
the basic need of moving a pallet or

272
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,320
looking at 3,000 lb you're trying to

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,279
move it from one location to the other

274
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,399
for you to do that today you have to get

275
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,839
a forklift a forklift has to be at least

276
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,880
3,000 lb just to balance out cuz it's a

277
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,320
forklift heiring something in front of

278
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,120
it it has to be at least another 3,000

279
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,560
lb so you're moving 3,000 to 9,000 lb

280
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,000
the forklift itself and then 3,000 lb

281
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
that you want to move it just makes no

282
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
sense we're we're moving 9,000 to move

283
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,200
another 3,000 and we thought about it

284
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,519
and we said okay this is such a

285
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,519
unoptimized system it's nobody's

286
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,639
touching it and it's kind of a given

287
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,279
people that go into warehousing and

288
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,320
Logistics called manufacturing and you

289
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,519
see this it's uh they kind of look at it

290
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,839
and they go okay this is our lot in life

291
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,680
this is how things are while we saw that

292
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,760
was like no something has to improve so

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,720
we're looking at you know designing a a

294
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,880
new primitive something completely new

295
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,639
let's rethink the problem our Bots are 7

296
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,760
pounds they can move 3,000 but they're

297
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,920
700 lb so that's it and it doesn't take

298
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,240
a larger footprint than the pup itself

299
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,000
now when you start from there I can n

300
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,800
3,000 lb forward backward left and right

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,639
up and down in full 3d with 700 lb robot

302
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,920
that is a different math compeat and

303
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,800
that's the approach that we're taking

304
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,600
with Nitra now if you limit the

305
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,880
variability of movement to the three uh

306
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,560
Dimensions now I can start to solve

307
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,639
things with software the boss can only

308
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,760
do the three movements and they can uh

309
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,240
access any part of the warehouse uh

310
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,519
within a structure now I can start to do

311
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
things with software if I want to build

312
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,200
a

313
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,800
conveyor I don't have to build a

314
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,600
physical conveyor I can tell the Bots

315
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,800
move in the direction of a conveyor or

316
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
lift and so it makes your Warehouse

317
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,040
completely software addressable which is

318
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,720
a completely new approach to doing any

319
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,199
of this and it applies to warehousing

320
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,279
Logistics manufacturing anything that

321
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,120
moves your standard pallet and that's

322
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,199
why we wanted to focus on the pallet

323
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,560
because that's 90% of material movement

324
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,560
around the

325
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,000
war kind of my take on Founder mode is

326
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,160
is effectively as companies get larger

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,240
the gist is do you still kind of

328
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,600
maintain your level of awareness and

329
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,199
involvement in the details of your

330
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,880
company right very large company mode or

331
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,720
manager mode it's like I fully rely on

332
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,199
my team to do almost everything and I I

333
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,279
have this little function maybe I'm just

334
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,480
attending dinners and selling customers

335
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,600
at a very high level I think you know at

336
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,199
a company like Mitra you know even

337
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,040
though we're 74 people Aman and I have

338
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,600
no choice but to be in founder mode

339
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,480
there's just too much going on there's

340
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,760
too many aspects of the system you know

341
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,480
every time a customer walks in we have

342
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,519
one this afternoon and between the two

343
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,920
of us we need to be fully versed in the

344
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,480
technical stack we need to be able to

345
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,360
answer questions of like why did you

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,800
make this decision for this actuator or

347
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,120
this design what other reliability

348
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,000
issues how do you plan to lower the cost

349
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,040
like things like that if you can't talk

350
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,639
intelligently about that you're not

351
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,480
going to drive confidence in these very

352
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,440
sophisticated potential buyers of

353
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,680
Parkers so for us like there's no choice

354
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
but to be found or M but you know as I

355
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,880
think about what I love about this job

356
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,440
you know I love being in designer riew

357
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,560
so I love the product and the

358
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,000
engineering aspects and I know I'm onos

359
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,040
too and that's that's something that you

360
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,240
know as you get older as you get company

361
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,759
gets more mature and larger there's

362
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,040
natural pressure to say like you need to

363
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,720
de from that you need to let your team

364
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,839
do that and I think there's there's a

365
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,959
balance that can be achieved where

366
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,880
Founders are still in the

367
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:14,639
details not making all the decisions but

368
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,440
in the details enough to be aware I mean

369
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,199
Tesla's a I don't know if it's a good

370
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,519
example it's an example of where you

371
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680
know Elon had you know when he met with

372
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,600
Tesla for his one or two days a week it

373
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,440
was like 12 meetings in a day and like

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,480
every hour some different technical team

375
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,759
would come in and like walk through

376
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,120
here's what's going on here's the

377
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,920
challenges what should we do boss right

378
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,720
and he would be making calls on like how

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,279
electronic sourcing and then we'd be

380
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,279
making calls on like wind tunnel design

381
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,800
optimization they'd be making calls on

382
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,000
on a whole bunch of different aspects of

383
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,079
the business not suggesting that's what

384
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
every company should do and that is not

385
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,320
what we're going to be doing but I think

386
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,880
it does show you that it's not like one

387
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,120
or the other you can exist as a large

388
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:01,279
company in founder mode you can exist in

389
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:05,000
manager mode for us you know we're much

390
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:08,680
more towards fure mode and probably will

391
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,199
stay that way for as long as we to

392
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,279
really understand the technical details

393
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,000
which as far as I'm concerned doesn't

394
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,560
end actually the advice I would give to

395
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,680
people trying to create their own

396
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,800
company really work in the field a

397
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,600
little bit right work in the field you

398
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,639
think you have an idea for some new

399
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
service or product work in that field

400
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,000
and get insight that's something I got

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,920
out of my Stanford experience you maybe

402
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,600
you have an idea of what's really

403
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,959
valuable and useful as a product but the

404
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,120
best approach to creating value is first

405
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,519
that you get insight into what the

406
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,399
problem is the reason walty and I

407
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,079
started working together is we met at

408
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,279
the uh the model 3 production ramp and

409
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,000
we were customers of the systems that

410
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,800
were there manufacturing and Logistics

411
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
and material flow systems that were on

412
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,040
the system that were in production we

413
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,959
met there and we experienced Insight we

414
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,079
saw what the problem really is people go

415
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,639
hey add more automation add more

416
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,880
technology here fine okay but the

417
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,440
Insight that we got that the fundamental

418
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,920
problem that needed to be solved is

419
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,680
moving the material without you

420
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,720
experiencing it for firsthand you miss

421
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,319
it you think oh I'm going to work on

422
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,839
Warehouse robotics you're going to build

423
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:28,399
this nice you know articulated arm it's

424
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,959
going to look nice and neat and great

425
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,399
are you really really solving it no and

426
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,600
the reason you're not solving it is

427
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,279
because you lack the insight into what

428
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,880
the fundamental problem is for us it was

429
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,399
oh the thing that would unlock

430
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,680
manufacturing is to move the material

431
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,240
efficiently without stopping in a very

432
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,079
reliable Safe Way You Move it in that

433
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,240
way figure out a way to do it and it

434
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,000
would unlock value for you in

435
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,399
manufacturing without that Insight I

436
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,279
think you're you would be on a long path

437
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,720
so my advice would be get immersed in

438
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,560
the problem Firs head and then try to

439
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,679
come up with a solution I'll give you

440
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,400
another very practical example today

441
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,919
everybody in the company today everyone

442
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,760
almost no exception has to work in the

443
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,679
warehouse using our system interacting

444
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,679
with the warehouse operators at our

445
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,360
customer site everyone even web

446
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,120
developers uh marketing everybody has to

447
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,799
do it and the reason we did that is from

448
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,440
my experience when I was at Tesla and

449
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,320
building the software that I told you

450
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,000
about it the software for the uh the

451
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,679
g410 the way I built the software is I

452
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,360
went to the line and I started working

453
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,280
on the cars I started you know putting

454
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,320
volts head and talking Fasteners and the

455
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,640
hood on the model 3 and I experienced

456
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,760
what the operator was experienc what

457
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,880
kind of software was needed what did I

458
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,679
need to finish my job pop and then I

459
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,679
built that software and that software

460
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,000
infected everywhere that gule that is

461
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,320
the Insight that you need to get before

462
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,039
you can say oh I'm going to build a new

463
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,720
manufacturing software first work as a

464
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,760
user of that supposed system or product

465
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
that you're trying to create get deep

466
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,240
Insight so you fundamentally understand

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,480
what is the thing that you're trying to

468
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,960
create what is the value that you're

469
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,320
trying to create and then go okay I have

470
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,360
enough Insight that I know so much about

471
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,440
this I understand it at a basic

472
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,240
fundamental level now you can come up

473
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,080
with the new value creation after that I

474
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,919
think that's the best advice I could

475
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,000
give before somebody says I want to go

476
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,320
and build Hardware there are many little

477
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
tiny startups that have YouTube videos

478
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,919
or videos that that have amazing

479
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,760
wonderful devices and you go but what is

480
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,080
it solving is it practical are you

481
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,120
solving a problem it's because they did

482
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,520
the shortcut they said I'm going to

483
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,919
build something that looks cooler great

484
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,440
go build it but you're not really

485
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,760
solving the thing you need to go and

486
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,360
immerse yourself get insight and that's

487
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,280
why we have everybody here at the

488
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,039
company work at the warehouse with our

489
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,640
customers and so when they come and

490
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,520
build a solution they build it as a

491
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,000
warehouse operator they go oh I'm a

492
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,000
warehouse operator who happens to know

493
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,520
how to build applications how to build

494
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,080
robotics you know here's how I would

495
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,559
build it for me that's the best way to

496
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,559
build

497
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,000
products I mean if you look across the

498
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,280
tech Spectrum most companies and you

499
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,520
know Andre's famous quote heart software

500
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,760
will basically eat the world is very

501
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,280
true I think you know when you look at

502
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,120
the economy you realize that 85% of the

503
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,520
economy or GDP is driven by physical

504
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,400
Industries physical problems 90% of the

505
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,640
value in the tech economy has been

506
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,280
created by mostos software there's a

507
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,360
huge discrepancy so when we look at the

508
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,919
problems yet to be solved that haven't

509
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,360
really been touched by software they all

510
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,080
involve some sort of actuation or

511
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,760
manipulation of the physical world iot

512
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,919
Internet of Things has been around for

513
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,520
few decades and that starts to solve

514
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,400
some of the problems around Hardware it

515
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,600
gives you signal back from the physical

516
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,000
environment into some sort of brain or

517
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,559
software but ultimately the actuation of

518
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,880
that requires people or something else

519
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,280
but when you think of Robotics as

520
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,520
applied to the physical world that

521
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,760
closes the loop like I can build an

522
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,320
actuator a thing to move a physical item

523
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,760
up down left right that's hardware and

524
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,320
the combination of that actuation Clos

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,480
in the loop along with the software

526
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,039
capabilities that can be applied to it

527
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,280
there's a ton of potential there right

528
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,240
this is the next Frontier the next

529
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,440
several decades you know you look around

530
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,000
you and you see look at all the

531
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,600
inefficiencies in the world you look at

532
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,640
how the trash is picked up you look at

533
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,960
how houses and buildings are constructed

534
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,039
you look at how telephone cable is laid

535
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,520
you look at how physical Goods must be

536
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,080
you know manufactured and there's a lot

537
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,400
of opportunity for for software applied

538
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,000
to the physical world and that's why all

539
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,720
of of us here at mitro we're super

540
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,760
passionate about software fly to the

541
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,120
physical world and that comes in the

542
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,400
form of Robotics and that is a that is a

543
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,799
hardware hardware company the second

544
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,600
reason why Hardware is is perhaps more

545
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
exciting today than it might have been a

546
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,279
few decades ago you know when you think

547
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
of Hardware you think of silicon like

548
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,520
making silicon ships that was really you

549
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,120
know most of the hardware opportunity

550
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,880
but companies like Tesla and SpaceX have

551
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,799
come along and they said look these are

552
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,520
Legacy Industries the script has been WR

553
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,120
for how to build Automotive vehicles and

554
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,440
what margins for for decades and Tesla's

555
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,400
coming and saying we're going to do it

556
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,159
differently everyone told you know Elon

557
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,200
and Company they're crazy for doing this

558
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,840
there's very low probability for Success

559
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,880
there's lots and lots of ways that this

560
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,840
go poorly for them but built an

561
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,480
architecture that's significantly

562
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,919
simpler 10x simpler or more than the

563
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,480
existing products right there's bar your

564
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,720
parts and shown that you can disrupt

565
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,120
some of these industries it's hard

566
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
Hardware's hard but if done successfully

567
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,559
and done correctly there's huge

568
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,559
opportunity to make meaningful advances

569
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,360
in building you know electric

570
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,760
vehicles is for some people it's much

571
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,880
more rewarding than you know optimizing

572
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,760
some age on a on a website or or

573
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,960
increasing ad spend by 5% or something

574
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,400
like that so there's been a bit of a

575
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,200
blueprint in a Playbook that says you

576
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,120
can disrupt very large Industries

577
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,200
through Hardware uh through some of the

578
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,080
more modern successes like you know

579
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,279
Tesla WD rivan SpaceX andal couple balls

580
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,279
like that
