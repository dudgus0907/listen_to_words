[Applause]

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,759
First in the tank are sisters seeking to

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,759
share an old family recipe with the

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,759
world.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,840
Hi Sharks. I'm Casey and I'm Vanessa.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
We're from Boston, Massachusetts and

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,840
we're the two sisters behind Jaju

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,800
Perogi. Today we're seeking $300,000 for

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
8% equity in our company Jaju Perogi.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,960
Wow.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
Okay, I'm actually not a

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,960
perogi. So, Sharks, do you know what our

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
love language is? It's perogi. Perogi

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
are Eastern European dumplings

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,719
traditionally made with potato, cheese,

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
and dough,

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,960
boiled, and fried in butter. Growing up

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,800
in Western Massachusetts, we always had

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
perogi from our grandfather's deli in

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
our freezer. There was no mac and

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,559
cheese. If we were hungry, grab perogi

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,239
and fry them up in some butter. When we

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
went off to college in Boston, our mom

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,680
would hand deliver these same perogi to

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
our dorms and all of our friends would

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,520
ask, "Hey, where'd you get those?"

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
Inspired, we dusted off our

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
grandfather's handwritten recipes and

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
got to work creating Jaju perogi. We use

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
the same ingredients our grandfather

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,119
used. Our dough tastes like it was

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,080
rolled out on the kitchen table. Our

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,759
perogi are pre-boiled, flash frozen, and

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
ready to eat in 10 minutes. They're

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,439
great for families and individuals

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,280
alike. So Sharks, who wants to come

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,320
smell like butter with us and make

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,400
perogi a household staple? In front of

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,320
you, you'll find our lineup of flavors.

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
Potato and cheese, sweet potato,

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,799
caramelized onion, jalapeno, cheddar,

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,479
loaded baked potato, and kbasa red bell

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
pepper, as well as with some sauerkraut

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,360
and sour cream for dipping. So Vanessa,

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,479
I'm Eastern European. If I had if I was

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,759
on my deathbed and God said to me,

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,920
Robert, you can have one meal, it would

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,520
be perogis. Oh, I grew uping I grew up

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,560
in progress. I grew up in Pittsburgh.

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,560
Yeah. Yes. All right. Here we go.

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,079
This Wow. is a good perogi. Yum. Let me

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,560
just tell you, one of the beauties of

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,560
perogis is it's greasy and gooey. This

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
loaded baked potato is greasy and gooey.

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,440
I mean, it's so good. Thanks. It has a

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,280
lot of umami. Vanessa, why is it called

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,200
ja zu? It is not a Polish name. So, Jaju

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,760
is the phonetic spelling of grandfather.

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,319
So, in Polish, Jaju is like an

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,319
affectionate way of saying grandfather.

61
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,480
Is that your grandfather there? Yes, our

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,640
grandfather is here. Um, so the whole

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,720
inspiration for this business is that we

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,680
grew up around his deli. In 2016, we

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,720
went back to the deli, took our

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,120
grandfather's handwritten notebook with

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,959
all the delies from like 1960 and

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,160
started tinkering around. And we didn't

69
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,239
really know what to expect. The first

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
market we went to, we brought 40 boxes

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
and we sold out in an hour. We're taking

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
names, phone numbers, addresses, like

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,160
trying to deliver. But up until the end

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,640
of last year, I mean, it's still the two

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,480
of us. So, we're in 2500 stores and it's

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
been the two of us, no brokers. No

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,400
brokers, nothing. Wow. That's good for

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,599
you. Let me give let me give you some

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
good news cuz I've done a lot of

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,640
research in this space. Pot stickers,

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,319
dumplings, perogis are the fastest

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,480
growing convenience food in America

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,640
right now, beating pizza growth. Yeah. I

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,080
invested in it into Brooklyn Dumplings.

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
When I saw the growth numbers, I

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
couldn't believe it. And you're in the

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
frozen section. Yeah. So, and who are

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
you in? Do you mind staying? So, we're

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
nationwide with Whole Foods, uh, with

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,040
Sprouts, and then we're in Mom's

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Organic, we're in Harris Teter, we're in

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,400
Fresh Market. Our sales this year will

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,799
be 2.7 million. Are you guys profitable

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
with that? So last year we actually lost

95
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,360
um $100,000 and we would have been

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,840
profitable, but we um we didn't

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
negotiate for our contract with a large

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
grocery chain like we should have. We

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
were very emotional about getting into

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
the chain. I knew middle of last year

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
that we were going to run out of cash.

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
So I knew that that was the first time

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,920
we had to go raise money. Obviously had

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
no idea how to do that, but my back was

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,599
against the wall. So, I felt like at the

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
end of last year, my organs were like

107
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,959
falling out of my body because cash flow

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,360
is such a problem like with food, right?

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,200
Like you put you have you're growing and

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
you're growing every year and then and

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,159
there's no money. Do you have money?

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,560
Exactly. So, last year um we raised

113
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,639
$400,000 at a $2.25 million valuation.

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,799
So, you've given away about 20% of the

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,199
business. 18. And Vanessa, today your

116
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,160
valuation is what? 3.75. 3.75. So in

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,560
less than a year when we raised money,

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
we were not national with Whole Foods.

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,479
We are officially national with Whole

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,440
Foods and so we're projected to do 2.7

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,400
2.8 this year. We've been in Whole Foods

122
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,880
for 3 weeks nationally and we are moving

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,600
like between 12 and 15 bags just

124
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,840
starting without any demos, nothing a

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,000
week. That's very high. Are you

126
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,680
impressed by that? Yeah, it's very

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
solid, but I'm not sure that it

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,160
justifies that $3.75 million shark.

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,240
Listen guys, um I don't see it as the

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,280
right business for me right now. So, I'm

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
out. Thank you, Lori. Per package, what

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
does it cost you to make and what does

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
it cost you to what do you sell it at

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,240
wholesale? Okay, so for the retail bag,

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,919
um it's $3.89 for the bag to make and

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,120
how how many frog is in it? There's 12.

137
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,840
Okay. Um, and then the cost to the

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
distributor is 633. Wow. That's not

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
great. That's not great margins. That's

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
not great margin. What is the sell at

141
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
retail? Um, suggested is $9.99 to

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,400
$10.99. That's your problem right there,

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
isn't it? Cuz you don't have a lot of

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,360
wiggle room. You need to knock off 35%

145
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
off your manufacturing costs. This is a

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
great product. I love them. I eat too

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,800
many of them. That's part of the

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,320
problem. I balloon to 600 lb. I have no

149
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,639
willpower when it comes to stuff like

150
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,479
this. And I'd rather be a a customer

151
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
than an owner. So, for those reasons,

152
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,280
I'm out. Ladies, I'm going to crown

153
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,639
myself the perogi king. Yes, I love

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,479
them. Couldn't love him more. Here's my

155
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:02,560
offer. If my fellow friend and shark,

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,800
the food king, Daniel, goes in and he

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
wants me as a partner, I will go in with

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,520
him. So, if you can talk him into it,

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,520
Yeah, we I'll come along.

160
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,120
Two sharks are out. Robert is interested

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,680
in Casey and Vanessa's frozen perogi

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,600
business, Jazu, but he wants to partner

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,360
with Daniel for his expertise in the

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,960
food space.

165
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,919
Guys, you got to talk Daniel into this

166
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,639
deal. I I am so excited about

167
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,680
everything. I just think we need a food

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,520
guy in this. That's how we when we heard

169
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
that you were a guest shark, I like

170
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,240
cried. I've always admired and wanted to

171
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,240
work with you. Keep going. Keep going.

172
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,080
And like yeah, I've watched you from

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,479
afar and like what you did was kind and

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,199
then you sos and like but I think you do

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,199
this deal with them and we will find a

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
way to cooperate together and introduce

177
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,120
them and then if it makes sense we join

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,919
forces and if not my my friend amigo

179
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,919
they they cried they cried their heart

180
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,160
out. Are you not human? Did you watch

181
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,639
the episode last season where I did a

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
deal with Toasted? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,599
it's a sister pair like you. In some

184
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
ways, it' be kind of fun to do the

185
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,479
sisters frozen space. In other ways, I

186
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,560
feel like it might be competitive

187
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,360
because No, I

188
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,319
um I really don't think it'd be fair to

189
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,639
my partners at Toasted to do this

190
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
without certainty that that it won't be

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,479
seen by them as competitive. We think

192
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
you'd be a great partner, though. We do.

193
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
And it's tricky because I do think there

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,360
could be synergies, but I am not sure.

195
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,800
So for those reasons, I think I'm out.

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,120
All right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you,

197
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:53,520
ladies. I Daniel's out. I'm out.

198
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
All right. All perogis lead to Mr.

199
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,759
Wonderful. That's what happens. Here's

200
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,639
my offer. Listen carefully to it cuz

201
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,160
it's the only way I would do it. I work

202
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,400
with the largest c-ackers and

203
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,240
distributors. Number one. Number two,

204
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,199
Luten Libre makes the most inexpensive

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,919
pot stickers, dumplings, and perogis.

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,400
That's how you would get your cost down.

207
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,000
I own that business. I bought it just to

208
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,160
give me vertical strength in Brooklyn

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,960
dumplings. Those are dumplings. They're

210
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
all the same. We'd add this to it. I

211
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,599
don't know how tied you are to Jadu or

212
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,840
not, but I'll give you the 300,000. I

213
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
want

214
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,360
20%. I have the distribution. I have the

215
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,360
c-acker. I have the protein maker and I

216
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
didn't bring up the fact that I do a lot

217
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
of sales on QVC as Chef Wonderful in

218
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,160
this category. In fact, I own this

219
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
category on QVC. You don't own perogis.

220
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
They're all the same. Pot stickers,

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
perogis. Listen, you understand what I'm

222
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,000
talking about. The manufacturing of this

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,320
category of convenient food is all done

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
in the same mold factory. Whether it's a

225
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
perogi, whether it's a pot sticker,

226
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,399
whether it's a dumpling. I have a

227
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,600
question. What if I went in with Kevin?

228
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,120
No, I don't want that. Lori. Lori, will

229
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,920
you make an offer? What if I went in

230
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,080
with Kevin? No.

231
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,560
So, the offer that we have right now is

232
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,959
because we have a lot of chatter is a

233
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,640
20% for 300,000 and then you want to

234
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
take the production to the the place

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
that you No, I want you to meet the

236
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
management Brooklyn Dumpling and you

237
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
decide which of the elements you're

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,720
going to use. I don't want to do the

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,519
deal unless you're using my

240
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,519
infrastructure. Otherwise, what am I

241
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,920
doing this for?

242
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
When you see the synergy of what they're

243
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
building over there, you'll realize,

244
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,279
wait a second. I want to get into the

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,000
stores across America. I want Walmart. I

246
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,920
want Costco. I want it all. By the way,

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,440
you've achieved something. Was it 2100?

248
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,720
You have 2500. That's nothing. So,

249
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,320
because you're bringing us into the

250
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,920
infrastructure, would you be willing to

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,480
do um $300,000 for 10%. Why would I do

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,800
that? It's a plugandplay, right? I'm the

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,640
only offer you

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,480
have. No, I I appreciate it, but the

255
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,160
answer is no. And Robert, you're

256
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,920
completely out. I can help you eat them.

257
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,080
Sometimes it's really great to do deals

258
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,320
with other sharks, but I have everything

259
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,079
you need. Everything. What do you want

260
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,720
to do?

261
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
I think uh I you know, you can speak to

262
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,000
the numbers, but I we think that our

263
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,720
valuation is is fair and that that 20%

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,399
fine is too much to give up. That's how

265
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,839
we feel right now. Yeah, good for you

266
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,680
guys. Good for you guys. You guys are

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,600
very impressed. You will do great. Okay.

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:39,959
Well, thank you

269
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,959
guys with us. Good luck.
