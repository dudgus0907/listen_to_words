arguing that from one it's

78
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,400
one-sided I don't think people care

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,480
about my onion ring and the fries but

80
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,040

110
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,480
truth and the government's going to stop

111
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,640
you like sometimes I'm just talking and

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,799
talking I'm thinking and like even if

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,879
I'm alone I'm just thinking about it

114
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,760
like like I'm getting real close to

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,600
unveiling some crazy things that I know

116
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,919
the government's trying to surpress and

117
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,720
one day I won't be surprised if they

118
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,320
come stop me really you think the

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
government's watching you that much well

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
just I don't think they're watching I

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,160
think the Govern has a list of 10 people

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
that scare them and Nicks on it I agree

123
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,039
like they're just the 10 people are just

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
getting way too awfully close to the TR

125
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,280
so give us give us some of the things

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,039
you're really close on well I just think

127
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,320
about all like the different people you

128
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,039
see every single day and the amount of

129
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,080
like different like routines like you

130
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,800
have to think when you go to like the

131
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,400
grocery store right you could bump into

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,440
like a high amount of like 90 100 people

133
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
in the grocery store right and it's just

134
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,400
like all those people are there with a

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,199
separate goal and Mission and every

136
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,039
single person has their own drive and

137
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,840
their own like end goal for what they're

138
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,840
shopping for they could there could be a

139
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,520
full Breakout of anger and people

140
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,560
dueling and fighting there could be an

141
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,360
FBI spy lurking through the shelves to

142
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,759
try and get to an end goal what I'm

143
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
saying is like I don't think I'm

144
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,199
necessarily close to unveiling or

145
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,199
uncovering something I just think some

146
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,199
people are and I'm like I'm fearful for

147
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,520
them because like I saw these two guys

148
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,199
the reason I brought this up that I have

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,360
a podcast and they were talking about

150
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,000
just like some crazy thing that this guy

151
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,199
thought he found Bigfoot like for sure

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,360
like for real and then he was dead like

153
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,960
I think he that die after coming close

154
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,680
contact to things like that's just a

155
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,800
thing that I if you like die on us

156
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,479
should I like check what you've been

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,400
working on to see if it was the Govern I

158
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,919
feel like if they take away whatever

159
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,360
he's been think oh God but what I'm

160
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,160
thinking of you have to give us like a

161
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,120
folder with like a password no I'll find

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,680
a way but what I'm thinking of

163
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,840
is just the amount like I think

164
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,120
something underrated we do as like

165
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,080
humankind is let a lot of things slide

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,160
we look too quickly past people who are

167
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,080
close to discovering something or know

168
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,800
about something that just die or vanish

169
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,880
you know what I'm saying saying no one

170
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
you die once think about that you can

171
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,520
die one time you're gone forever you

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,360
know what I'm saying there's way too

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,720
many people that one death they're just

174
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,639
dying from coming close to something you

175
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,520
know what I'm saying or do I sound crazy

176
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,039
no it's like the guy who found got like

177
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,000
right like it's just like I feel like we

178
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,240
have to look out way more yeah not for

179
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,280
me personally cuz I don't feel like I'm

180
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
taking like enough steps towards like a

181
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,720
goal here of something like I'm

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,319
unveiling I'm a my thing is my thing is

183
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,560
right if the government's hiding

184
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,560
something right and they're doing a good

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,680
enough job you might find it by accident

186
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,520
because you might not even know what

187
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,400
you're looking for huh so a hidden in

188
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
plain sight type thing correct so what

189
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,039
if one day you find like a special stone

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,800
that isn't supposed to be where it's

191
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,240
supposed to be and you you pick it up

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,680
and it starts like glowing and he just

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,919
gets like sniped in the back head cuz

194
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,360
like the government oh cuz the

195
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,759
government picks up so quick that like

196
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
like they're like oh my God code red he

197
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,560
found the stone what are you looking at

198
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,520
I agree what are you always doing that

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,759
for like it's just I'm not looking at

200
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,599
anything you're talking you're talking

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,720
to Nick but you're like this I'm like

202
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,280
like if I was talking to you right now

203
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,240
and I was like this it's a little weird

204
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,800
and I'd look whatever Matt don't you

205
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
think the way that he just really shut

206
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,400
that down was a little suspicious I

207
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,240
agree like I feel like you might shut

208
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,240
down what like you were like oh I'm not

209
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,120
looking at

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,440
anything well I was thinking of the

211
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,000
stone being outside like the I'm just a

212
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,599
little like sometimes I get a little

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
scared the one that started glowing the

214
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,440
one from the story oh I was so confused

215
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,919
also like we're triplets right that's

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
rare yeah you know what I'm saying what

217
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,319
if that was like biological warfare

218
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,680
created by like like people set like oh

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,080
they're going to be triplets and like

220
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,440
one of them needs to turn against the

221
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,039
others and like they're we're going to

222
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,720
plant them scares we're going to plant

223
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,800
them there to monitor and see the

224
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,599
triplet life but they know deep down

225
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,720
that their in rooted goals are back to

226
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,680
come back here and give us the

227
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,960
information do you have that or do you

228
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,240
know you have to make it somewh I was

229
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,080
thinking it was you I don't have

230
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,440
that like I just think of like do you

231
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,159
have anywhere to be no like do you guys

232
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,199
have you have any like ulterior motives

233
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:15,000
like like transport conversation or

234
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,039
anything like let them know what like

235
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,479
cuz I just think all the time like I'm

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,400
trapped in my own mind a lot and I think

237
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,120
like I feel like wallets need to be far

238
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,800
thinner like can we believe that like

239
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,280
the F where are we going hold on like I

240
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,000
feel like just a wall in your pocket's

241
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,800
like the thickest thing you can have

242
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,719
like okay like look at your wallet that

243
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,919
just depends on what kind of wallet you

244
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,919
buy no it doesn't depends what kind of

245
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,000
wallet you buy regardless can we we

246
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,200
haven't thought why youing you watch I

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,440
saw I was like Wow put can I be real for

248
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
a second you want to know what I think

249
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,399
is really impressive I just feel there's

250
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,680
so much crazy madeup stories that are

251
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
turned into TV shows cuz I think about

252
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,480
it and I'm like like from the start oh I

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
know what you mean when you watched the

254
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,120
first episode like oh like if someone

255
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
makes a bank robbery show and it's like

256
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,959
a great

257
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,040
plan yeah like why did

258
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,279
why you just rob the bank agree why did

259
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
you have that plan that's what I'm

260
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,000
saying like it's like a TV show where

261
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,360
like there's like an alternative world

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,519
that drove through this portal at this

263
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,640
time in that place like something had to

264
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,399
happen to that person for them to like

265
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,000
get into the mindset to write this TV

266
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,800
show they're hiding something I think

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,880
they were

268
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,399
there sure they I wouldn't say there but

269
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,720
maybe it could be like they were their

270
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
way of living out their dream the Govern

271
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,800
let them speak about it so they use the

272
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,800
show is The Voice on do you ever think

273
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,839

274
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,920

275
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,760

he you guys saw that yeah no that was I

279
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200

again and like tases us and tries to

281
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,640

283
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,000

295
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,680
a sus mobile bro yeah like with a really

296
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,079
big white beard like driving old car and

297
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,079

god oh it's not him I'm joking that's

300
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,480
another

301
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,000
guy but no what I up his hair hold on

302
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,440
but what I was going to say we also

303
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
we're yelling in a car and all the

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
lights are on so it's like I'm a little

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,519
sused out but I mean I'd look to dude

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
but anyways I think it was just cuz you

307
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,959
Nick has such like cartoon character

308
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,440
manorisms you

309
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,839
know say

310
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,360
yippe Nick's the type to run in place

311
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,800
I've dead ass seen Nick get excited and

312
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,720
go like

313
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,519
this okay legitimately did that Len what

314
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,639
I'm also thinking is every single thing

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,160
that you say like as an idea like every

316
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,920
idea you have or if you're joking and

317
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,440
you're talking about like a a fake

318
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,160
scenario like a fantasy scenario you're

319
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,040
never I feel like it's not an original

320
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,920
thought like it happened from like

321
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,079
watching a different show even if it was

322
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,800
like when you were like years years

323
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,360
years ago like imagine if like there was

324
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,760
like a small world and we were all

325
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,399
living on it it's like nah you just got

326
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,760
that idea from way back in your head

327
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,360
from like Hort and hair a who you know

328
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,920
what I'm saying so I feel like it's like

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
everything in your life regardless of

330
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,200
what you're saying you lowkey got the

331
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,600
idea from something el else oh agreed

332
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
right so what I'm saying is he said it

333
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,320
weird since every single person had to

334
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,920
have got an idea from something like in

335
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,200
their past to like talk about it again

336
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,399
all these fantasy stories and stuff like

337
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,720
in the world it's other people's

338
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,839
perspective on things I feel like they

339
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
just have to be like lowkey real like I

340
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,279
don't believe in fantasy I believe

341
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,079
fantasy was real you know cuz like who's

342
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:09,600
making these up I'm with who's writing

343
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,040
like Disney movies as if like like

344
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,560
you're telling me that was an original

345
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,600
thought that you came I mean those are

346
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,720
like I could believe someone wrote there

347
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
is you have to you have to but you

348
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,040
because there's another movie that

349
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,720
exists already that gave them

350
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,680
inspiration listen you have to listen

351
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,199
there is like creative like there is

352
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,320
like creative like people create and

353
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,920
people have imagination it's just you I

354
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,199
have far more imagination Crea you have

355
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,360
far more storage in your membrane from

356
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,480
other things and it may not even be like

357
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,040
a lot hey Nick a lot of stuff nowadays

358
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,480
is hard to like in like come up with

359
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,360
creative General ideas because

360
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,680
everything is so like washed out and

361
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
everything has been used so that's why

362
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,959
it's like there's a difference between

363
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,040
being inspired by something and creating

364
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,600
something brand new but it's also very

365
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,120
difficult to create something very new

366
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,959

only

407
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,800

where my native family is and all that

409
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,800

my great-grandfathers grew up and [ __ ]

411
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639

412
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,399
sense also I I would hate to do that

413
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,639
because I would hate to know like I'm

414
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,480
pretty sure they tell tell you what like

415
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,199
diseases and ailments you're susceptible

416
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,320
to and it's like I don't want to know

417
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,920
what I could get let me just get it but

418
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,240
they also like that's so strange to me

419
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,680
like I would not want to know any

420
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,040
information you also just then find out

421
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,079
you got mad my thing is if you know

422
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,000
about the future if I if you know about

423
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,600
the future you'd spend your whole life

424
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,680
trying so hard to change like what if

425
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,440

426
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,279
historical figure oh high five Nick not

431
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,199
you ever think of it like that no

432
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,680
everyone is history technically everyone

433
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,639
is making it impact enough to like like

434
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,959
like like what if our it's crazy how one

435
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,920
thing you do can totally alter everyone

436
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,959
in this like not everyone in this world

437
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,839
but like if I wanted to go like the

438
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,079
butterfly fact I know what you mean if I

439
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,959
wanted to go to Target and Chuck a

440
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,000
gallon of milk at an old woman and she

441
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,240
like broke her head and like Snapped her

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,160
spine or something and then imagine no

443
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
listen she goes she goes to the doctor

444
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,480
now her grandmother her her daughter

445
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,399
realizes Story scared to go to Target

446
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,600
never goes to Target again but then like

447
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,759
her uncle is like oh it's okay and then

448
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,560
like the doctor has like a near like

449
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,959
close experience with her while doing

450
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,759
surgery he goes home and tells his kids

451
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,680
his kids get emotional and like grow up

452
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,560
to be like some like it's crazy oh my

453
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,759
God you're so right and I also think

454
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,519
like what if like same scenario you like

455
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,399
if I just stop talking right now the

456
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,759
whole career could be different yeah but

457
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,800
like if I said something we could like

458
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,199
blow up on like a Tik Tok and be like oh

459
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,240
my God like our world could could be

460
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,160
different depending on what you say but

461
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,199
also I think of like imagine same thing

462
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,759
you threw like an Jaga orange juice at

463
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,079
an old lady's head oh so now it's orange

464
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,000
listen could change now the orange ju

465
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,360
the orange ju it could be different it

466
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,800
could be different you know what I mean

467
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,720
big big CH also I just imagine this you

468
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,560
take like an OJ like I was thinking OJ

469
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,160
cuz they have like the

470
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,839
long it looks kind of like a drum like

471
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,360
those drums but anyways you could take

472
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,120
it and hit the old lady in the face

473
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,040
we're not even gr it anymore we're just

474
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,600
yeah just like swinging whatever and

475
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,079
like I feel bad for the poor woman and

476
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,280
it like breaks open it's like listen and

477
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,799
it breaks open and she falls yeah and

478
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,360
then someone could have been going to

479
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
check out and they see me do that and

480
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,120
like hey stop and run over and like go

481
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,240
to help her but then at checkout they

482
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,799
could have met like their like wife not

483
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,640
only wife but like he could have been

484
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,160
like a scientist working on something

485
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,400
that was super close to figuring it out

486
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,520
and he could have bumped into another

487
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
scientist that would have helped him

488
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,559
figure that out and the whole [ __ ]

489
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,520
that's crazy that one like gave me like

490
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,000
chill Anything Could Happen you could

491
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,880
cause a complete shift and that's how I

492
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,760
think of like we can dead ask me a free

493
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,640
will like if I wanted to I could go into

494
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,760
a Target and just lay down and

495
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,679
go and I could affect everyone around me

496
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,919

497
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,240

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,360
butterfly effect slightly well no I

541
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
think they just know what would trigger

542
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,640
it like we don't know who to hit with

543
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,000
the OJ you know to affect someone's day

544
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,360
they would know the timing this is

545
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,799
called the OJ Theory by Chris and

546
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,760
ntera this is called the orange juice

547
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,000
Theory it's the target Theory I think

548
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,480
this is called no it's just like the who

549
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,679
to hit with the orange juice correct so

550
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,880
it's orange hold on I got to so

551
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,400
basically listen listen you made that

552
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,240
out speak but basically what we're

553
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,720
saying is the government could do the

554
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,480
slightest things and just really alter

555
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,720
all of us this is called the m and it's

556
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,799
like how many conversations do you have

557
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:01,240
like in your whole life that no h w t o

558
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,120
JT so it's what

559
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:09,039
w

560
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,799
w okay but anyway WT many WT H WT o JT

561
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,320
who to hit with like if we didn't film

562
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,200
car videos like everyone's life could be

563
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,679
different correct or better sorry it

564
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,960
could be better like what if like

565
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,039

566
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,600
