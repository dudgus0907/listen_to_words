00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:05,279
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,510
Next into the tank is a product designed

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,820
to blow away a common cooking hazard.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,820
[Music]

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,039
Wait, there's no crying and cooking. Not

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,960
if we have anything to say about it. Hey

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
Sharks, my name is Glenn Smith and I'm

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
his daughter and business partner,

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,279
Madison Smith. And today we are here

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,119
seeking $90,000 for 15% equity in our

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,120
company.

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,800
Sharks, for generations, cooks around

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,680
the world have sought relief from the

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,640
infamous onion tears. The burning, the

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,879
itching, my eyes. Cutting onions is

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,920
painful. And we have tried all the hacks

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,440
and none of them have worked for us. We

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,440
have tried chewing on bread while

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,440
cutting.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,559
We've put a matchick between our teeth.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,879
And this guy has even worn yard goggles

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,280
in the kitchen.

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,199
And trust us Sharks, none of these hacks

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,119
have worked for us, which is why we

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,600
invented the Fion. The Fion is a

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
countertop cute cordless fan that is

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
placed next to your cutting board, which

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
simply blows away the fumes and vapors

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,360
of eye irritating vegetables such as

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,840
onions, shallots, peppers, garlic, etc.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,840
You'll only cry tears of joy. It really

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,360
is that simple. So, come on sharks.

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Who's ready to chop it up with the

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,560
fanion? And who's ready to be blown

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,880
away? Now, sharks, no need to get weepy.

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
You each have a fanion to blow those

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,200
tears away. So, you have an onion, a

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
knife, and a fan to really put this to

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,119
the test. So, there's a lever on the

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
back that'll turn it on, and you can get

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,040
to chopping.

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,000
And Madison, do most people cry with

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,799
onions? Yes, we've Yeah. Well, why would

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,040
you not? Like I don't really often cry.

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
I don't like this doesn't sting me at

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
all. Really? I am told that if you wear

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,960
contacts that can be something that

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,719
would wear if you wear contacts. If you

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,159
wear

50
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,040
contacts, you're lucky. You know, a

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
unique attribute about vampires. I'm a

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
vampire. We We don't have to cry about

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
onions. We can cut any kind of

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
vegetable. No problem at all. As long as

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,520
it's dark outside. Is this your

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,920
full-time jobs? And And also, please

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
tell us about you. You go ahead. I I am

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,879
a vice president of a large US poultry

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,640
company. I buy uh feed ingredients, feed

60
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
chickens. And Madison, what do you do?

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
After graduating from Georgia Tech, I

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,959
studied industrial engineering and I've

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
worked in the technology and supply

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
chain spaces for about the last four

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,519
years. So, this very simple product, I

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,519
get it. How much to buy it? We sell them

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
for $19.99 on our website. And what does

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,319
it cost you to make them? 809. Well, you

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,840
know your numbers. How many do you sell?

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,239
We launched in November and about seven

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,720
months. We have sold almost 1,800. We

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
have 28,000 in sales. That's not bad.

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,760
Not bad at all. How are you guys

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,599
promoting it? We've predominantly done

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,840
social media. We've put a lot of money

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,440
into running ads. And how much money

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,080
have you spent on advertising so far? On

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,920
advertising about $178,000.

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,360
And how much money have you invested to

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,599
get it to this? $468,000.

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Hello. That's a lot of crying over on

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,200
you. Where did you get the money to

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,239
spend 468,000? Cash, credit, home

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,159
equity. Home equity, too. Home equity as

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
well. Correct.

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,440
Wa. But what did you spend that on for

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,599
this? Uh, mostly inventory. How much do

88
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
you have in inventory? At your cost. How

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
much do you have in inventory at your

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,840
cost? 31,000 units. Okay. So, that's 240

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,720
250 grand basically. Correct. You got

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
31,000 units. What is it costing you to

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,280
acquire a customer right now? Do you

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
know how much did you spend on

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,879
advertising divided by the number of

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,440
units you've sold? So 17,000 divided by

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,599
almost 1,800. Yeah. So right. So about

98
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,519
10 bucks a unit. Yeah. So you're

99
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,159
breaking even you're not making any

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,360
money right now. You're you're losing

101
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,400
some. Yes. What's the plan to sell the

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,480
existing sunk inventory? That is why we

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
are here is that we need help with that

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,000
where we really started trying to go

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,239
100% direct to consumer. Over 10,000

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Google searches happen every month of

107
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,799
people searching how to stop crying

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
while cutting onions. I mean there's

109
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,720
viral Tik Tok videos. This is definitely

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
and it works. We know that it works and

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
there's not a product out there like it.

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
And everybody loves a kitchen gadget. I

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,560
mean maybe there's a reason why there's

114
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,639
not a product out there like it. Look

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,280
guys, I give you a lot of credit for

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,040
diving in and going for it. But this is

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,680
too niche a market, right? Because when

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,840
you limit it just to onions, that's too

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,840
small, right? And not a lot of people

120
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,759
are going to spend

121
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,680
$19.95 just to be able to do onions

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,400
alone. So for those reasons, I'm out.

123
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
Thank you, Bart. Here's the thing. It's

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
something that happens all the time. I

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,919
watch it with entrepreneurs. You get so

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
excited that you don't realize one of

127
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,080
the most perilous pitfalls when you

128
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,720
first create a product is ordering in

129
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,919
too much inventory without sales. You've

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,560
sold 1,800 in 8 months, give or take.

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,720
You've sitting on 31,000. This could

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,960
take you 10 years or more, right, to

133
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
sell it. So, what I think you should do,

134
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,800
a suggestion is sell it to someone at

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,560
your cost just to break even, but to get

136
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,080
money back because you don't want to sit

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,000
on that big of an expense. It's not a

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,680
journey that I want to take cuz I know

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,520
it's a rough road. Um, but I wish you

140
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,080
good luck. I hope you try that. I'm

141
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,479
sorry. carry them out. You got a bunch

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,720
of money tied up in inventory here, 250

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
grand. So, if you sold these things at

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,639
$9.99, you'd get half your money back.

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,479
And you say the other was a lesson in

146
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,400
life. Uh 31,000 units. Um that's worth

147
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,280
crying about, not the onion. I can't

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,280
help you because I can't help you.

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm

150
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,800
out. All my friends have never started a

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,160
business. They think the starting a

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
business is like standing on the edge of

153
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
a cliff, ordering 30,000 units, and

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,120
jumping into the water. Great

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,160
entrepreneurs learn about controlled

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,199
risk. You never want to make a mistake

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,160
that's going to kill you. It's very hard

158
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,000
to come back from the dead. Kevin's done

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,840
it, but very way it works. You made a

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,039
big risk and now you're stuck with it.

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
But you got to get rid of that

162
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,479
inventory. There is no we're going to

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,880
grow our market. We're going to sell it

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,919
here. Get rid of the inventory that you

165
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,600
have even at a loss. Even if you get 50

166
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
cents on the dollar. I disagree. They're

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,240
being very melodramatic. No, they got

168
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
rid of dramatic. They took a line of

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
credit on their house to get here.

170
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,440
Welcome to the Onion Advice Bank. It's

171
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
not for me cuz it's not investable. I

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,560
hope you get some of that cash back. I'm

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,080
out. Glenn and Madison, um I love the

174
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
fact that you're working together. My

175
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,120
daughter's here watching uh Shark Tank

176
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
today and it's such a special thing.

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
It's the most important thing in the
