00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,359
Hi Sharks. My name is Aaliyah Marendis

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,720
and I live in Austin, Texas. Let's be

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,880
real, hair removal sucks.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,759
It's a tedious task that we have to do

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,400
over and over again. As a hairy brown

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,199
girl with very sensitive skin, I've left

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,160
so many waxing salons with less hair,

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,480
but my skin my skin was collateral

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,519
damage. Wall Shark's hair removal has

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,480
never been sweeter. Literally. Say hello

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,760
to Sugar Dough at home. sugaring kits to

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,480
remove any hair. We like to say we got

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,600
your back and your front, arms, legs,

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,239
and anywhere else. Made with just sugar,

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,280
water, and citrus, our all natural

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,399
sugar-based dough gently pulls hair from

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,760
the root while exfoliating your skin,

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,000
leaving feeling silky smooth. And it's a

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,000
gentle, compostable alternative to

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,320
waxing. So, Sharks, I'm the sugar mama

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,920
to sugar dough. So, I'm asking for some

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,080
serious dough. I'm seeking $500,000 for

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,799
5% of the company.

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
But first,

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
come on.

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
Kendra, my friend Rishot here is in need

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
of some sugaring himself. Do you want to

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
come up and be his sugar mama and sugar

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,360
with me?

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,400
I do. I get to like remove.

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh my gosh, this is so exciting.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
Kevin's back. Make her do Kevin's back.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,320
Yes, I know. Are you serious?

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
This is my dream come true. So, sugar

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,720
dough is made with this taffy like goop

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,759
and it is very fun to play with. It's

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,280
kind of similar to caramel or taffy made

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
with similar ingredients as well.

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
Okay. What do I do?

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
So, you can actually try on this side.

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
Okay. So, all right. Tell me if I'm

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
doing this right. Okay. I'm going to

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
mold it into your skin. I'm going to

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
have

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
I'm going to let it heat up a minute.

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,920
Exactly. And I'm going to help it. And

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,159
then you want to pull taut with the

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,520
other hand. So, pull the skin taut and

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,520
then 3 2 1. Woo! Oh my god.

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
You did a really good job, Kendra.

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,840
That's so satisfying.

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
That was awesome.

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm going to dismiss Resot. Thank you so

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
much.

55
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,959
Good job.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,800
Try to wrap my head around the 500,000

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,760
5% 10 million valuation. This innovation

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
is ancient. It was found in Phoenician

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,599
times. Women have been using it forever.

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
Yes. All through the Mediterranean. Yes.

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,440
And I mean there is zero proprietary

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,760
elements to it. Anybody can do this. So

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,640
help me, help me, help me get to $10

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,239
million.

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
We've actually worked two years to

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,400
create a proprietary manufacturing

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
process and also our own formulation. So

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,440
that's where we have some of our own IP

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
to be able to

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
you do your process is the IP.

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,280
Yes. Exactly.

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
So now would be a good time to tell us a

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
little about sales.

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
Sales.

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Sales.

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
Sales.

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
I would love to tell you about our

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,480
sales. I launched in September 2020 as a

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
solo entrepreneur and at that point at

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,280
the end of the year I made 50k in

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,080
revenue. Got it.

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Fast forward to 2021 we went viral on

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
Tik Tok and we made $2.6 million in

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,959
sales.

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,800
From 50,000 to 2.6

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
50,000 to 2.6.

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
That's what I'm talking about.

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,920
And then last year we ended the year in

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,879
$5.6 million in sales.

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,000
Wow. Wow. So, we first started in DTOC

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,959
and then we grew to Amazon and then at

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,599
the end of 2022, we made it in 300 Ulta

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,040
Beauty stores. Last year, we expanded

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,560
full nationwide and into 1300 stores.

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,599
And so, that's where we had that big

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
bump in sales.

97
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,159
Did you make money on the 5.6?

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
No, we didn't make money.

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,159
How's that possible?

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,799
We didn't make money. So in order to

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,200
make profits in retail, we learned the

102
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,159
hard way that you really need 85 90%

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,400
margins. Our margins were around 60%.

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
However, this year we updated our

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,560
suppliers and we implemented our

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
manufacturing process and so our margins

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
are now hovering around 80%.

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,680
Did you lose money or?

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
Yes, we lost money last year.

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
How much did you lose?

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
We ended the year at 777%.

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,879
So you lost $440ome,000.

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
How did you fund all those losses? Me

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
and my husband invested $400,000 of our

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
personal

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,200
lost more. You lost 400.

117
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,000
So then that's that goes into our debt

118
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
that we have right now.

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,479
How much debt do you have?

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
We have $1.5 million.

121
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,320
Hello. There we go.

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
Yeah. We also have $1 million in

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,040
inventory.

124
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
But it also means that you have like no

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
cash right now.

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,360
We have no cash right now. That's why

127
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm here in the Shark Tank. Yeah.

128
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,919
That is what you need.

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
That is what I need right now. Yeah.

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,160
Especially if we want to get into more

131
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
retailers.

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,919
You can't afford to go into more

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
retailers. We have debt financing which

134
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,479
is at a high interest rate of 22%.

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
Wow.

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,560
Hello.

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
There it is.

138
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
So your total debt is 1.5.

139
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
Yeah. That's what's killing us right now

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,720
is because 20% of the money that we

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,040
borrow is just out the door. We had all

142
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
this money tied up in inventory and now

143
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,160
we're right sizing. So so much has

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,880
changed in the last few months.

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
Going through hyperrowth like you did

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,360
Yeah.

147
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
is hard. Yes. borrowing money to get

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
there put you even further underwater

149
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
because you're all it feels like you can

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
never catch up and and get even right.

151
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
Yeah.

152
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,320
I wish I had a way where I could just

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
say here you go. This is the approach.

154
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
But you know

155
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
I thought when I walked in and saw it I

156
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,080
thought this was food and I got hungry.

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
I just don't know this stuff at all. So

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
for those reasons I'm out. But I wish

159
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,080
you the best.

160
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay. Thank you Mark. I appreciate it.

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,720
The ask is too big without even fighting

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,880
about the valuation. I would never value

163
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
this at 10 million right now. You've got

164
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,800
sales. I like that. But you got a long

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,039
way to go. It It's, you know, if you'd

166
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
come in here for like 100, 150, even

167
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,000
200, maybe I take the ride, change the

168
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,000
valuation a bit, but this is nuts. I

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
think it's nuts. So, for that reason,

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm out.

171
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
Thank you, Kevin.

172
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Yeah. So, it's hard because you couldn't

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
predict that you were going to go this

174
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
high and then as soon as you got that

175
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,039
that level, well, you had to learn what

176
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
you didn't know, right? the the amount

177
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,720
of margin on these things and then you

178
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,280
got to borrow money against it. You

179
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,639
can't leave uh Ultra empty-handed when

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
they asking for goods.

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
Yeah.

182
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,280
But uh you know to give you $500,000 for

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,560
5% uh you would have to distribute $10

184
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720
million.

185
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,199
Uh if you going if you're doing really

186
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,280
well,

187
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,039
that's to get your money back. If you

188
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,319
just to get my money back, that means

189
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,120
you probably would have to do

190
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,479
in this model

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,080
$50 million.

192
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,680
You'd be older than the Phoenetians that

193
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,039
invented this by the time you got your

194
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
money back.

195
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm out.

196
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
Thank you so much,

197
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,080
Aaliyah. You're amazing, by the way. And

198
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
I, you know, as you were talking, I've

199
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
been there. Like, I made some of these

200
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
same mistakes. I did my business on a

201
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
line of credit. I was bootstrapping

202
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
everything. I had credit card debt. I

203
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
mean, I it was hard to get anybody to

204
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,759
invest in me, you know? I know how what

205
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
that feels like, but what you're

206
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,919
accomplishing is really, really

207
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,400
exciting. I mean, you went from 28 to

208
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,720
56. Um, I love what you're doing. This

209
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,319
is just not my business and I'm a little

210
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
worried about the amount of debt that

211
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,759
you have, honestly. Um,

212
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,240
can before you say no, I'm willing to

213
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,440
make a deal and that's why I'm here. I

214
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,000
have worked my butt off for the last

215
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,520
four years and grown super fast to be

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
able to get to the point where I'm at

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,800
now. And I really would like

218
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
partnership. And you are sharks. You

219
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,479
guys love problems. This is a great

220
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
problem to solve.

221
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,639
Not sure we love.

222
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
We do know we love problems.

223
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,840
We love solving solving problems. Y'all

224
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
are problem solver. You would want to be

225
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,599
here.

226
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,000
The 500 that's just a big ask. And and

227
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,440
it's not even going to really put even a

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
little bit of damp on what you've

229
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,759
already got to deal with, right? It's

230
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,560
not going to really solve a lot of

231
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
problems. But I really do admire you.

232
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm out.

233
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.

234
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,560
One of the things that concerns me truly

235
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
is just the competitive market.

236
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,840
And so I wish you good luck, but I'm

237
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
sorry I'm out.

238
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay. All right. Thank you guys so much.

239
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,160
I appreciate it.

240
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,160
Thank you.

241
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
I am disappointed that I'm walking out

242
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
without a deal. Um I really think that

243
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
with the sales that we had that they

244
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,039
could see the potential, but I love

245
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
surprising people. I love proving people

246
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,120
wrong. And so I hope in two years they

247
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,000
see Sugar Dough in tons of different

248
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,000
retailers and they're like, "Oh,
