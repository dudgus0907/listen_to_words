1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,839
Next up is a business that indulges in a

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,839
guilty

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,919
[Music]

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,680
pleasure. What's up, Sharks? I'm Kelsey,

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,800
founder and fearless leader at Dope

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,320
Cookie Dough. I'm seeking

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,279
$450,000 in exchange for 10% of my

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
company. I'm Dallas born, California

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,599
raised, and I'm loving life in the Bay

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
Area, running San Francisco's first ever

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,960
cookie dough bar.

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,200
Life is crazy and adulting is hard. But

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
what if just for a few moments, you

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
could be transported back to your

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,719
childhood, sneaking bites of cookie

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,960
dough in the kitchen? At Dope, we serve

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,879
nostalgia by the scoop. We're here for

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,520
the big kid inside of all of us.

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,440
However, we're anything but childish.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,920
We're a millennial brand serving over

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,600
20,000 customers each month. I'm on a

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
mission to get dope in every city in

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
America through opening additional

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
hightraic storefronts, franchising, and

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
expanding onto grocery store shelves.

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,080
Sharks, this deal is too dope to pass

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
up. Who's in? We got samples. You want

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,840
to try it first? All right, I can get

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
some samples for you. Please. Do people

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
love cooking? Got the mouths watering.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,680
Well, people that like sweets. Oh, I am

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
so stoked for you guys to try this.

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,759
We've got six different flavors. There's

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,840
one plate for you. There you go. Special

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,000
for you guys. We made a vegan avocado

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,799
brownie cookie dough. Cute. Cute names.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
Thanks so much. Avocados.

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,880
People love the fun. I love the names.

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
Got to keep them laughing.

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
Wow. It's sweet. Thank you so much. You

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,920
bet. It's really sweet. Thank you so

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,439
much. Thank you.

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
So, we've got the OG. That's going to be

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,799
your classic chocolate chip. The vegan

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
OG is made with vegan butter so that

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
those on dietary restrictions can

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
indulge. Cinnamude is going to be like a

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
snicker doodle with white chocolate

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,000
chips. Raisin the roof is an oatmeal

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,920
raisin flavor. What? What? He's got it.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
Choahholic is for the chocolate lovers.

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
And then this more is hella dope. So

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
that's going to be marshmallows, graham

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
crackers, and chocolate chips. Just like

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
love the names. Our three sizes,

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
self-control, legit, or fully commit.

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,959
Um, funny names. So we've got a

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,319
storefront on Pier 39. Um, it's one of

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,920
San Francisco's biggest tourist

60
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,000
attractions. I know it well. So is that

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
your only location? That's our only

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,440
physical brick and mortar. Is that the

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,680
actual store? Uh, it is. Yeah, we do

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,239
$1,100 per square foot. Oh, wow. That's

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,920
a lot. Wow. You have competitors? Yeah,

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,840
there are some competing companies. So,

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,000
there's one in New York City, uh, who's

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
sort of on par with me. It's definitely

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,720
coming in like the cupcake trend and all

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,239
of that stuff where it's going to take

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,360
off. Kelsey, when did you start the

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,680
business? So, I started, uh, in April of

73
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,640
2017. Um, I had spent 10 years in tech.

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,000
I Oh, I see the correlation now. Yeah.

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Right. Processor chips to chocolate

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,040
chips. I had been working since I was 16

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,760
uh at Intel. And at Intel? Yeah. Since

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
you're 16. Yeah. Why is that? Uh I

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
started as a high school intern, but it

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
was really hard on me and I put a lot of

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
pressure on myself. So I developed a

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,239
really unhealthy relationship with

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,200
alcohol through the years. And Friday I

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,360
turned three years sober. Um got sober

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
and that changed my life entirely. Um

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
I've always had this entrepreneurial bug

87
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,159
and doing something on your own has just

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
been the most rewarding thing. So, in a

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
year and a half, we're over 850,000 in

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
sales. And what are you making on the

91
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,200
850? Yeah, we have a 35% net income

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,720
ratio. Okay. We've got 14. This

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,519
calendar, what will your income be

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,440
pre-tax? Our net income is $240,000 for

95
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,800
this year so far. And what's your plan

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
going forward? Where do you envision

97
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,480
your business going? World cookie dough

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
domination.

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,440
How are you going to get there? Um, my

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,120
main focus is on these hightraic

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,799
storefronts. I'm in lease negotiations

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
right now for a spot on the Las Vegas

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,680
strip and the mall sees 72,000 people

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,720
per day enter their doors. Wow. So,

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,120
you're here on Shark Tank today at a 4.5

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,040
million valuation. You're asking me to

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,840
pay 30 times your pre-tax profits. 30

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,239
multiple on something that is completely

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,159
not proprietary because it's cookie

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
dough. Yeah. Anybody can do it. The

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
difference is you're a good operator.

112
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah. But that one always makes a

113
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,239
difference. No, but it's not worth 37

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
times. It's just cookie dough. Here's

115
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,040
the problem. You're going to grow until

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
somebody says, "I want to compete with

117
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
you cuz it looks so good."

118
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
She has compet. Yeah, there's certainly

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
a lot of competition. And look at what

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
happened in cupcakes. I'd like to

121
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,479
compare myself to one of the major

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
cupcake brands that made it through this

123
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
with sprinkles. If you recall, kind of

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,079
this rise, every mom and pop opening one

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
on every corner. But there are a few

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,520
brands we all know and love still from

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
the cupcake trend. I'm going to be one

128
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,720
of those for cookie dough. We're also

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
expanding into wholesale. So looking at

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,199
grocery stores, you've got major chains

131
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
like Whole Foods. Do you have any

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,880
wholesale now? Um, yeah. So these jars

133
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
are just starting to hit the market and

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,639
we're in San Francisco's airport.

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Kelsey, you're an amazing operator.

136
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,440
Like, thank you very much. Your story,

137
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,440
your numbers, everything. I don't like

138
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,479
cookie dough. So I know, I'm sorry, but

139
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,080
how many people like cookie dough? I

140
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,560
would say a significant amount. I call

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,320
it

142
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,600
like I I find it too sweet. You just

143
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,520
have to know that people love it. Even

144
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,320
if you don't like it, it's got money

145
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,360
behind it. We make a scoop for 68 and we

146
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,000
sell it for $6. So the the direct margin

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
on this product is incredible. I feel

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440
like a shame to say that for customers

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
watching, but it's pretty awesome. We're

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
really cultivating an experience people

151
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
are willing to pay for it. And where

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
where's the value at 4 and a half

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
million? Talk to me a little bit about

154
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,199
that. So I did this valuation not even

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
including the Vegas operations, just

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,479
growth of our own pier store, growth of

157
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,120
local wholesale, and that's going to get

158
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,560
us to 2.25 million next year in revenue.

159
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
right in revenue. Correct. And what do

160
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,919
you think you'll make on that? I mean,

161
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,440
we've been moving uh with this 27 to 35%

162
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,680
net income ratio. I don't think I've

163
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,720
ever met a more sophisticated store

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
owner in my life. Yeah. Wow. 10 years at

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Intel will do that to you, man. I've uh

166
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
watched some amazing leaders make really

167
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,520
difficult business decisions, and it's

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,080
undoubtedly the reason this has gotten

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,840
so far. That and my sobriety. Um I feel

170
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,000
so present and so focused, and I just

171
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
know exactly where this can go, and I'm

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
looking for one of you guys to help me

173
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,680
take it there.

174
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
I I wish it was something else. I can't

175
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,960
get there on the cookie though, though.

176
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm out. I totally understand. Yeah,

177
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,080
probably pretty much like a Robert. I'm

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
going to go out simply because I just

179
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,759
don't like cookie dough.

180
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
Yeah, I understand that. It's cute. It's

181
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,560
fun. I know that there's a lot of people

182
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,560
that really love cookie dough and you've

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,960
proved it, but it's not something that

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,240
is a healthy enough option for me. Okay.

185
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,319
So, I'm sorry. I'm out. Okay. I totally

186
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
understand. Yeah, we are looking into um

187
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,919
some snack size packaging and something

188
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
more portion control where you can have

189
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,160
a little So, Kelsey, you've proven

190
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,000
yourself as a strong operator. Clearly,

191
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
sales justify what you're doing. I'm

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,639
going to give you the credit of making

193
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,840
2.25 million next year. So you're you're

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,919
basically going to end up with around

195
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,960
$350,000 to distribute to investors,

196
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,759
giving you about five to six times free

197
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,759
cash flow after tax puts a valuation of

198
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
you about 1.8 million bucks. The problem

199
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
with your deal was valuation. Nothing

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
wrong with you. Okay. No, I totally

201
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
respect that. I think a lot of uh

202
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,240
there's so many ways to do valuations in

203
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,800
this world and u I do the real way. He

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,000

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,639
mark. You forgot to write the check.

207
