12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,540
bro what do you think the strongest

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,540
animal is

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,540
oh

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,920
I feel like a good healthy gorilla is

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,059
not [ __ ] around we've talked about

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,340
this yeah like we've already talked

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,440
about this no lists like top five top

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,059
five strongest animals ready to go

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,079
elephant elephant elephants elephants

21
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:00,120
getting stomped on by an elephant

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,960
giraffe okay I know no you're just

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,960
listening big animals

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,619
giraffes in the wild if like three lions

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,799
were attacking a giraffe oh it's [ __ ]

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,900
their legs are so strong that if they

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,000
like kick the line to stop it it could

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,500
break its spinal cord with like one kick

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
you know I feel like bugs don't really

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,560
count

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,240
bugs aren't strong I know I'm just

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,619
saying as animals like bugs don't really

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,780
count for me

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,400
no you know when people are like people

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,380
I don't know like what's the most

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,020
populated animal and they gotta try to

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,119
throw like oh my Ants it's like

38
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,640
come on ants don't count what's like the

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,140
really that's absolutely no like but I

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,400
think of animals like bugs are on the

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,680
last of my phone I'm just gonna let you

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,360
I don't know yeah no it's like when they

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,799
throw bugs in the mix and it's like you

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,420
just want the statistics about the big

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,040
animals

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,020
sorry

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm confused because bugs are random no

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,159
no no it's like world's strongest

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
animals

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,479
world's strongest animals and it's like

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,740
an ant can carry like 80 of its body

52
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,840
weight

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,180
it's an ant obviously we don't care

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,700
they're small like I want the big strong

55
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,259
animals like when it's like top 10

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,020
strongest I feel like bugs should be

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,060
excluded I completely disagree that's

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,920
insane would you not be more shocked to

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,420
find out that like ants are stronger

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,440
than like animals you might think are

61
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,319
stronger

62
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,000
but it's like the comparison the

63
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,520
comparison of strength is just stupid

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,020
it's like oh Nance real strong it can

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,060
carry 80 percent of his body weight but

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,800
I can kill it it doesn't really you're

67
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,959
not that strong I got it I got it it's

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,599
like strength of perception

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,239
sure if everyone it's like an ant that's

70
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,819
that big like the size of an ant it can

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,920
carry 80 of its body weight but you

72
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,840
could not do that so that why that's why

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,099
that's impressive because but the ant is

74
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,660
strong at the end of the day you can

75
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,220
still step up damn stronger than me but

76
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,140
he's a little [ __ ]

77
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,360
whatever I don't know it's two different

78
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,860
like whatever next topic let's go it's

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,660
two different categories what's your top

80
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,879

81
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,000

the skill crane with like the candy in

85
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,379

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,120
this candy been in here so long and I

87
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,860
saw a worker watch us playing it and

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,959
like generally like look a little like

89
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,879
really like he knew that the candy in

90
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,860

00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,120
Rollie

92
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,440
how often did Tootsie Rolls expire

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,159

94
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,680

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,779
like an and a c or like an m and a CM oh

225
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,180
my God Matt and Chris like there was a

226
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,160
building yeah and it was like it was

227
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,140
like MC Plumbing or something and I was

228
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,820
like oh my God Matt and Chris it was

229
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,640
just a cool moment I don't know I don't

230
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,019
know why I do it okay siblings or dating

231
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
is gonna be the second part of this

232
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,019
video so welcome

233
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,580
um

234
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,060
they haven't really updated their

235
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,519
account like at all since the last time

236
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,320
they've only posted six more photos what

237
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,399
since that last video because I think

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,220
they kind of gave up on their account

239
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,420
like when we looked that's so sad

240
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,399
remember this is the last one we saw

241
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,260
yeah yeah I don't even know right I

242
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,019
don't oh I remember they're dating

243
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,980
first one

244
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,620
oh

245
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,540
I think they look nothing alike

246
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,800
yeah I agree but so that's gonna throw

247
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,779
the wrench in the plan I think that

248
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,880
makes it I like his shirt I hate it

249
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,080
honestly I kind of want it I was

250
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,519
honestly gonna talk about how much he

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,860
definitely needs some like some

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
sunscreen on his neck she looks a little

253
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,220
scared I'm trying to judge if they're

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,440
siblings are awkward dating

255
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,060
I accidentally swiped because it makes

256
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,339
sense though why am I so shocked I was

257
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,820
going to say dating yeah me too

258
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,820
yeah I see it next one

259
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,680
okay okay she's fully leaning on this

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,920
dude that has to oh look at their feet

261
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,360
oh they have matching sandals not even

262
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,040
close to matching but that's well it's

263
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,080
like they're like well they're just

264
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,399
really close together for me they don't

265
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,899
even look like this has to be a dating

266
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,360
if this is Siblings going to be really

267
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,240
Disturbed actually no no I'm not trying

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,500
to push you away I'm just thinking

269
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,660
she's fully leaning on them and they

270
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,100
look yeah you and Matt would stand like

271
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,540
this for a photo

272
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,940
uh

273
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,640
um really strange yeah no no you just

274
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,100

wouldn't say no no no no no no and like

276
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
[ __ ]

277
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,720
yeah that one's strange

278
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,940
Civ blocks siblings gets me every time

279
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,880
so I guess it's a common mistake that

280
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,380
they make okay next one oh terrible

281
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,700
photo well it's like they tried to go

282
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,700
portal why does it look like their hair

283
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,620
or like morph together it looks like her

284
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,240
hair it looks photoshopped in this it

285
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,060

286
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,500

because you were crowded okay this is my

291
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,540
thought process behind it I think that

they're like oh I'm trying to crack my

293
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,459

they're going on a hike dating

302
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,680

304
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,860

305
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,120
family Excursion because there's no way

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,760
this unless all right go okay ready

308
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,760

the only thing about them because

317
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,000
they're the same hair and glasses their

318
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,040
eyes and they're making the same

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,860

so different than hers ready they have

322
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,800
to be dating I mean siblings I think

323
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,079
that they're they think they're siblings

324
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,140

328
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,540
I don't know what's going on

329
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,139
[Music]

330
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,139
yeah

331
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,519
behind his left head his left side of

332
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,760
his head left head there's a like

333
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,440
bouquet of flowers in their drawers

334
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,820
they're at a funeral yeah yeah they're

335
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,160
at a family funeral

336
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,200
why are they smiling so much there's no

337
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
way okay I understand like okay listen

338
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,339
since we think they're at a funeral my

339
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,019
thought process is like if you're at a

340
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,339
funeral there's so much like family

341
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,139
there because someone are you gonna take

342
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,639
a selfie with your sister like no no

343
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,079
what I'm thinking is like you're more

344
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,639
likely to take a photo with your sister

345
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,779
rather than someone you're dating

346
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,899
because someone you're dating you're

347
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,579
like dragging not dragging along no no

348
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,459
I'm not trying out

349
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,240
hey we're dating drag you along the

350
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,500
funeral

351
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,959
you know what I mean not drag you along

352
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,240
but like you're going to like you're

353
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,800
going in support of like your love I

354
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,660

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,940
Adam no they are look there's a mint

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,500
thing in the back too they're for sure

357
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,480
at a funeral that's terrible but listen

358
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,459
think about it we have to think more

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,260
critically there's no way you're gonna

360
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,639
post up with like a selfie if like

361
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,440
someone you're dating like think about

362
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,940
it you're in a relationship stop telling

363
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,940
me to listen your own problems

364
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,899

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,959
next month I hate when you do this [ __ ]

409
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,480
there's also a game and we don't know

410
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,480
the format of the game

411
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,160
that's my [ __ ] no but it's like

412
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,720
know what's going on yeah but before I

413
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,399
go to this okay the game and the thing

414
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,800
is different the movie the movie

415
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,720
the game and the movie can't be that I

416
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,579
have a bright idea okay when before

417
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,620
watching stranger things did you play a

418
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,600
[ __ ] whole trailer of Dungeons and

419
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,300
Dragons no but there's like a storyline

420
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,320
a plot character it really really can do

421
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,579
the same thing think about it it has to

422
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,220
do with Dungeons and Dragons but it

423
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,079
really minimally right like relates yeah

424
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,399
it's a whole did you play Dungeons and

425
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,399
Dragons before going to the Dungeons and

426
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,579
Dragons Premiere no and I wished I did

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,040
that's true

428
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:15,959
you I really wish I didn't know what you

429
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,519
mean you're not actually validating what

430
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm saying more and more as you speak so

431
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
keep guys

432
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,980
Channel what do you think like a new

433
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,880
channel dedicated to fortnite I don't

434
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,880
think it's not just foreign

435
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,220
I hate when escalators go like this

436
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,959
why

437
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,259
like this one's going down this one's

438
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,259
going on

439
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,199
yeah you walked in you always go to the

440
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,339
one you just don't want to be at and

441
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,380
then it's like you got to go all the way

442
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,180
around it's so awkward too like you just

443
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,860
kind of oh I have to show everyone that

444
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,540
I made a mistake later but you wanna I

445
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,639
really don't understand either what like

446
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,899
a little metal fruit baskets in like the

447
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,459
fridge and [ __ ] no clue what you're

448
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,320
saying not the fridge like do you know

449
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,699
how like the little metal fruit baskets

450
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,800
that people have on like their counters

451
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,800
and stuff put your fruit in the fridge

452
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,160
no thing with like the

453
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,160
like oh

454
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,120
I feel like there needs to be a better

455
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,400
way to store food fruits like those

456
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,720
aren't in there can I tell you what I

457
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,419
actually don't get that makes more sense

458
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,579
than you not getting this what the fruit

459
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,959
like the fact that there's compartments

460
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,939
for fruit and vegetables and

461
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,580
refrigerators and depending on which

462
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,200
which way you put the level like there's

463
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,480
like we'll get a load of this spice

464
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,160

472
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:56,100
rough inside I feel like every fruit

473
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,160
like the shell is more valuable than

474
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,600
what's on the insides

475
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,120

says

535
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,840
Bay State Massachusetts is the Bay State

536
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,600
I don't know if that's a factual sense

537
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,720
that or like lobster or clam chowder I

538
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,720
think he's correct Massachusetts

okay it's called the base State refers

540
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,000
to one of the most famous bays Cape Cod

00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:33,200
where the pilgrims first settled yeah

542
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,200
we've been there for the whole point

543
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,500
oh my God we literally have a place

544
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,360
called Plymouth obviously the pilgrims

545
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,860
went there first why would the Pilgrims

546
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,860
go to Plymouth first they both start

547
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,840
with a P oh my God I love Cape Cod

548
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,400
Plymouth Plantation is where the pilgrim

549
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,900
that's like why no the Plymouth

550
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,100
Plantation nothing beat when we used to

551
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,720
go to political Plantation with like our

552
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,340
school and it was like in Plymouth and

553
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,840
it was about like the pilgrims oh my God

554
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,760
it was like the most like surreal thing

555
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,260
ever no I remember we used to go I made

556
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,000
it so far the actors that were there

557
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,500
should have won like [ __ ] Emmys like

558
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,340
I'd go in and talk to the lady when I

559
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,960
was a little kid and I'd be like what

560
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,820
are you doing here and she'd be like oh

561
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,820
churning butter for my family this week

562
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,940
she was like okay she was churning

563
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,280
butter for her family insurance I'm

564
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,960
gonna be totally honest with you I had

565
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,059
no idea they were actors so you just

566
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,500
said that you thought they were pilgrims

567
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,260
I thought they were like living in

568
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Plymouth Plantation I just realized like

569
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,340
fully in my head that those were all

570
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,340
fakes they're all phonies

571
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,919
genuinely think that I want to go hold

572
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,080
on one of the most mind-blowing

573
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,059
experiences of my whole life was seeing

574
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,059
Plymouth Rock with my own eyes

575
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,260
but it was surreal because I felt like

576
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,120
the moment like I it's like dude when

577
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,559
you go to places that's in history you

578
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,020
only have to really know what's going on

579
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,120
you know it's deep like you know like oh

580
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,559
my God like I'm being for real you're

581
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,600
like where the Boston Tea Party well

582
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,179
dude we live in such a history based

583
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,980
State it's insane dude oh

584
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,280
Paul Revere one bit

585
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,020
I'm like pretty sure that

586
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,940
was dirty work and he did like the last

587
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,900
leg and we gave him the credit because

588
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,900
he like finished the job

589
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,159
deserves all this credit

590
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,200
I hate talking about history because I

591
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,220
just don't like I feel like I'm an idiot

592
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
and I don't want to like [ __ ] something

593
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,280
up but I feel like we give Paul a credit

594
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,340
to someone I feel like you always know

595
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,679
the most random [ __ ] ever

596
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,020
I did all I know is like seeing I'm not

597
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,059
even joking around like I know you oh my

598
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,700

April 18 1775 his fellow writer William

602
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:54,840
