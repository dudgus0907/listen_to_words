where we're like do we go home or do we

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,280

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,800
just walk for five more minutes then we

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,000
start walking down like the creepier

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,560
side like where it's like you know what

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,319
I'm talking about the Twist and Turn

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,480
it's like super dark right so we're

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,120
walking through the path and we get to

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,760
like right under one of the lights and

74
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,360
we hear like Zing ding ding you like

75
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,599

thingy like mystical tin like tinkle

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
right a little mystical tingle exactly

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,040
so then we're like what the [ __ ] was

82
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,959
that so we kind of like are already like

83
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,920
looking at each other like kind of weird

84
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,840
and then the light goes out as right as

85
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,239
we get under it the light like turns

86
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,879
back on and then we're like still kind

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,560
of like we had like full like probably

88
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,959
five to eight seconds of like what's

89
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,040
going on Boom oh like that and then the

90
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,080
whole place we're at looks like daytime

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,480

and we like start running away no and

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,239

96
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,560

let's go with the

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,400
story that's what it was M you want to

163
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,639
drink the guy at the Joker movie kept

164
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,360
like like taking up my whole armrest

165
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,199
like that like hitting me like direct

166
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,080
contact to my being and I was like dude

167
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,759
you can have the rest but like you

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,720
shouldn't be touching me once do I know

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,400
what I would have done what that man

170
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,800
would have turned around and heard I

171
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,680
would have shot up oh wow neck that's a

172
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,880
lot yeah I think like I wasn't done with

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,039
that you just took it out of my hand and

174
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,960
put you hand no I was holding it up [ __ ]

175
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,840
my bad I genuinely think the use of a

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,800
shotgun cocking like the noise and the

177
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:47,160
action actually is one of the best uses

178
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,639
of sound effect Machinery in all movies

179
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,520
like you know like a bad [ __ ] is like

180
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,639
like it's like like I think of I think

[Music]

198
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,800
like my best friends literally saw a

199
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,160
lepon when she was younger and says it

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
was the craziest thing ever I think your

201
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,840
best friend is stupid bro scary but

202
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,919
humbling I slipped on the school stairs

203
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,680
and the lads a year above me was coming

204
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:55,720
inside what is and everyone this isn't

205
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,720
paranormal are you an

206
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
idiot I'm so brutal when I was younger

207
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,919
there would be times my parents would

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,240
catch me talking to myself but I told

209
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,479
them it was a little boy sitting on my

210
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,560
fan and he looked like he was from the

211
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,840
60s and then my dad started having

212
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,039
nightmares of this lady in a white dress

213
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,039
and was supposedly his mother how did

214
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,080
you all put that together like why I'm

215
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,520
really confused by the connection there

216
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,919
why is he sitting on a fanboy and

217
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
and when I was eight every night I would

218
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,599
wake up to seeing a girl's body covered

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,520
in leaves and whenever I'd try to speak

220
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,800
or hit her

221
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,479

222
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,080

227
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,279
imaginary it was probably all imaginary

228
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,560

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,680
to my story no that one's spooky no your

325
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,800
story the other way

326
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,120
though that's similar to that no that is

327
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,760
like a triplet thing dude cuz the other

328
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,480
the other right I was in my room and

329
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,040
I've

330
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,920
been I thought that it was I've been

331
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,639
seeing things in the corner my eyes I

332
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,480

333
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,360

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,399
monsters in the corner of my eyes I look

335
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,279
like oh it's fine the other day I was in

336
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:13,600
my room and I for don't do that what I I

337
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,480
had sleep paralysis once where I woke up

338
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
and there was a guy pointing a gun at me

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,480
through the window which was supposed to

340
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,199
be closed I couldn't move and I thought

341
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,880
I was going to die because he was going

342
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,639

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,639
dressed in all black in the gun I

344
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,040
couldn't scream or move wow that's night

345
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,680
I think we're confusing nightmares with

346
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,160
paranormal stories though the other

347
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,320

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,559
upstairs and I was so confused so I went

530
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,960
up there and I saw a bucket on the floor

531
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,000
moving around and legit thought there

532
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,760
was a ghost moving it so I lifted it up

533
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,799
and it was my dog inside the bucket

534
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,360

564
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,480

scared to even say it out loud I'm going

567
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,240
to wish all evil don't even ever Max

568
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,840

that in life I hope you have sleep

576
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,559
