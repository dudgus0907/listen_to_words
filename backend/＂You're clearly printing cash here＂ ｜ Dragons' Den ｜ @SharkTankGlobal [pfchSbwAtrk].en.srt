00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello dragons. My name is Ben. I'm Joe.

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
And I'm Oliver. And our company is Lux

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
Collective. We buy and sell pre-loved

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,039
luxury items. So we grew up in a place

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,640
called Formbby. And when we say that to

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,560
people, they automatically assume, well,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
you come from a lot of money. But for me

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,279
and Joe, that's far from it. One

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,519
Christmas, my sister asked my mom for a

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,200
pair of £400 trainers.

12
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,680
£400? Why is my sister getting a pair of

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,640
£400 trainers when our budget for

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,320
Christmas is always

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,559
£100? So, I went to my mom and asked why

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
my sister has a bigger budget than me.

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,239
She told me they were from a secondhand

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
online luxury

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,960
marketplace. And I became obsessed with

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,719
this website, but I knew I could do it

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
better. I knew I needed a business

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,960
partner. So, I knocked on my brother's

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,520
bedroom and it took him about 3 seconds

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,159
to verbally sign the contract. So, we

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,519
started buying items off eBay and Depot

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,080
with clean them up and would sell them

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,799
on Instagram for more. We've now amassed

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,520
over 1.8 million followers. And last

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,640
month alone, we got over a 100 million

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,720
views across our main three social media

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,439
channels. Since incorporation in

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,479
December 2020, we have seen sales

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,360
revenue exceed 8.5 million pounds. We

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,520
are here today to ask for £100,000 for a

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
2% equity share in our company. What's

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,240
it called the company? Lux Collective.

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,520
Lux Collective.

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,640
Thanks for listening. I'm going to pass

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,520
you over to Ali who's going to give you

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,240
a quick demo on how it works.

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,159
A rags to rich's tale from brothers Ben

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
and Joe Gallagher and their colleague

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,280
Oliver Miller. Basically, this is our

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
website. Um, and we drop stock every day

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
of the week. And that can be anything

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,920
from bags, footwear, and accessories,

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,479
all from the top designer brands.

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,680
They're offering 2% of their designer

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,920
goods resale platform in exchange for

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,159
£100,000. So, that's more like the

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,160
buying side of things, but obviously we

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,160
do have customers who sell to us, so

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,000
that's where all the stock originally

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,200
comes from.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,760
Sara Davies is first up to find out more

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,760
about the company.

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Right guys, so is the business wholly

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,720
owned by the three of you at the moment?

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,920
Yes, 100%. And so when you say you've

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,840
done uh 8.5 million in sales to date,

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,200
yeah, give me the last few years since

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,360
you launched. So in 21 we did 2.5

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,080
million in sales revenue and a net of

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,319
285K. In year 2, 3.8 8 million in

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,840
revenue and a net of

66
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,959
255k. This year we're predicted and on

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,319
track to do 6.5 million in revenue and

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,319
to do a net profit of 420k.

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,319
That is very impressive. Thank you. Very

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
impressive. Thank you.

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,200
You're clearly printing cashier in terms

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,879
of the net profit of your business. So

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,720
you've come in today asking for 100k. It

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,000
begs the question why why have you come

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,000
here? So the next step for our business,

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,159
we want to go into retail like your

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Selfridges, your Harrods. We want to

78
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,239
have a store in there. Why? There's a

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
case study in America of a company very

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
similar to us who've done the exact same

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,200
thing. And I think they were on about

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
$15 million of revenue in 2018 and 2019.

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,840
It went into Nean Marcus. Nean Marcus is

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
a store in America. And now they're at

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,720
$500 million worth of revenue. So we

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
want to basically do that in the UK. So

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,319
why do you want a dragon? because we do

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,120
not know where to start at all with with

89
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,959
detail of how to get in.

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,080
So just thinking about your strategy

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,400
going into Selfridges or a Hower,

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,120
how does that match their strategy

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,519
working with the brands? So for example,

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,239
you're now got a nice store in store in

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,640
Selfridges. The brands obviously want to

96
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,799
encourage the sale of new product. Mhm.

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
Selfridges make good money off the back

98
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,120
of that new product and the new guys

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,319
roll into town to encourage their

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,639
customer not to buy that new product

101
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,400
when they can buy the same product that

102
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
somebody has discarded for half the

103
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
price. Yeah. How do you think the

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,960
brands, this is the specific question,

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,199
how will the brands react to Selfridges

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
for allowing you to be in that store? So

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,120
at the moment, Selfridges actually have

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
their own thing called

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,520
reselfridges, which from my personal

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
opinion and looking at it is not very

111
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,199
well done. So they are actively doing

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
it. Well, they're doing it on the back

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,560
of working with the brands, aren't they?

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
I can promise you they would have got

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,479
authority and gone to the brands that

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
they work with and said, "This is our

117
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,280
pre-loved area of our business model.

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
This is how we're going to really hold

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
that customer in tight for you, Mr.

120
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,960
Gucci, Mr. that Eve Salaron, you're

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,360
coming in as three disruptors and taking

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,120
their customer and I think that that's

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,320
flawed. I don't think you've got any

124
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,639
chance. And the reason why I think that

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,800
that's complete wrong for you to go

126
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,520
there is because I think what you have

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
and what you've done I think is

128
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
fantastic and I think you've got a huge

129
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
opportunity to take this to a 60 70

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,800
million pound business doing exactly

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,960
what you do. But I wouldn't pivot into a

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
strategy that when you don't understand

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,199
how that works across those luxury

134
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,680
markets. Okay? But I think what you have

135
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,680
here you could build upon and I think

136
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,400
you could force yourself into a

137
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,639
situation where a selfridges goes you

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,880
could become our pre-loved. I want to

139
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,639
acquire this business. That's an

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,639
opportunity that you should be selling.

141
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,639
Okay.

142
00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:00,720
[Music]

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,440
So, and so you said 100,000 for 2%. Yes.

144
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,479
So, you're valuing it at 5 million? Yes.

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,479
5 million? Yeah. Yes.

146
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,520
So, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you

147
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,039
where I am. Okay. Um, some people in

148
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,160
this den wouldn't get out of bed for 2%.

149
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,479
Not looking at anyone in particular, but

150
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,919
you're offering a a small stake in your

151
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,360
business. Yeah. But to have somebody

152
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,720
motivated to want to get really involved

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
in your business, they're going to want

154
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
to take a significant proportion of your

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,240
business. And so, you're going to have

156
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,600
to give away a lot more of your business

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
if you're going to walk out of here with

158
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,800
a dragon. Okay. Okay.

159
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,800
My personal opinion is you just need to

160
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
go and make hair while the sun's shining

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,319
and the sun is shining really really

162
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,400
bright and you just need to get your

163
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
foot on the gas and go for it. And if

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,919
you go for it in a big enough way doing

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,759
a lot more of what you're doing, some

166
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,319
big guy is going to come along and buy

167
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,160
you up or buy part of you because they

168
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
you are a pain in their behind and you

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,599
can scale this business without anybody

170
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
coming

171
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,520
in. I'm sat here thinking would I like a

172
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,680
chunk of this business? Absolutely. But

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,440
then I feel like you would resent me

174
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
because I'd won such a significant chunk

175
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,479
of your business. You'd get to the point

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,160
in six months time where you'd be really

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,280
frustrated and saying, "Why did we give

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,039
her all of that chunk of the business

179
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
when she's just told us to do more of

180
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,599
what we're doing?" Cuz that's

181
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,280
essentially what you need to

182
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,880
do. So, I'm going to shoot myself in the

183
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919
foot and tell you that I'm not going to

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,520

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440

just be done connecting you with those

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,680
people. So I'm going to offer you all of

199
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,039
the money for 5%.

200
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,599

know, you're just you just got you came

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,319
up with an idea. You you've done it and

206
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,840
you're turning over 6.5 million last

207
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,199
year. I mean, that is phenomenal. No,

208
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,719
they haven't. That's this year. Oh,

209
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,000
that's your projected. Yeah. Yeah. So, I

210
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
too am going to make you offer and I'm

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
not going to make it easier for you cuz

212
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,490
I also want 5% of the business. Okay.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,240
Thank you, Deborah. Thank you very much.

214
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,760
[Music]

215
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,399
And there was one. Yeah. Look, um the

216
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,800
business looks

217
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,360
rosy. However, you get a few bad months,

218
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,480
it could turn. Yeah. And I think you're

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,600
going to need some strings pulled.

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,080
H to make things happen. And I've got 50

221
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,040
years experience this business, but I'm

222
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,519
not going to give myself away for 5%.

223
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,959
So, I'll make you an offer. Mhm. I'll

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
give you all of the money, but I want

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,560
10%. Cuz I believe that I can catapult

226
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,959
you quicker.

227
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,640
Thank you very much. Thank you. Can we

228
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,440
go and talk to the wall? Talk to the

229
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,440
wall. The window.

230
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,680
A trio of offers for the secondhand

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
luxury

232
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,440
traders. Steven Bartlett and Deborah

233
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,120
Meden have each pledged all the money

234
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,880
for 5%. Whilst fashion mogul 2 Casilian

235
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,680
has valued his industry expertise at 10%

236
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,640
considerably higher than the 2% that was

237
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,160
originally on the table. We'd go to four

238
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,480
to three. Go to four. Okay. Will the

239
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,880
young entrepreneurs be as impressive at

240
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,200
negotiating as they are at producing

241
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
high

242
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,120
profits? Uh

243
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,440
uh thank you for all your offers. I

244
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:18,040
right we really appreciate it. Um so

245
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:22,160
like when I was 19

246
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,399
um I kind of like didn't really like the

247
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
direction my life was going in. So like

248
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,640
I decided like I need to start working

249
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,120
on

250
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,480
myself and um I started listening to

251
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,240
your podcast even and like the

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
conversations you've had with all these

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
people really helped me get back on

254
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
track and live a like I never thought

255
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,360
I'd be in this position now showing you

256
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
guys my business that has turned over

257
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:52,519
whatever. Like you've helped me out a

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,519
lot man like I appreciate it. Um,

259
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
can someone help me out? I think I think

260
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,440
we prefer I think we would prefer to

261
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,200
work closer with Steven. Fine. The

262
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
difference is you're getting eight years

263
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,560
of experience with me getting 50 years.

264
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,279
It's fantastic experience. Have we got a

265
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,640
deal? I think we have to I think we

266
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
would prefer to agree. Well, we would

267
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,839
definitely want to return. I think 5%

268
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,480
for us is too high. Right.

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,560
We would do we would do 3%. That's where

270
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,000
we're at, Stephen. And like we would

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,000
shake hands on a day at 3% right now.

272
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,240
Can we meet in the middle?

273
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,360
I think 3%'s a good deal.

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,040
So, you wouldn't be willing to go to 4%?

275
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Sometimes in the den, you know, some

276
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,600
sometimes in the den want to see a bit

277
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,240
more willingness to negotiate and meet

278
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,480
in the middle and I'm I'm I'm a dragon,

279
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,639
so I'm meant to be like tough guy that

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
you know is going to like I don't know

281
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
throw the money at you tell you to

282
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,600
whatever. But I just I'm in love with

283
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
what your story. I'm in love with what

284
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,760
you're doing. I think you're great guys

285
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,399
and I'd love to work with you. So, in

286
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,800
this case, I'm accepting the 3%. You got

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,800
a deal? Yeah.

288
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,839
Success for the lads from Liverpool as

289
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,000
Ben's tough stance pays off and Steven

290
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,720
Bartlett pays up. Celebrate. Thanks very

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,279
much. Thank you very much. Now they have

292
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,920
their dream dragon. The question is

293
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,880
what's next for the business?

294
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,560
Um, definitely not retail.

295
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,480
It went down like a leather.

296
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,880
I used to push trolley and now I'm

297
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,000
working with Steven Bartley. I never

298
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
thought I'd be in front of him in

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,639
Dragon's Den. I actually thought I'd be

300
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,240
opposing him on on his podcast,

301
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,600
but it just so happens that this was

302
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,240
first. You absolute soft touch. I know.

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,880
They played you like a fil. They had no

304
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,399
negotiating power. Stroked your ego.

305
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
Steven, we love your podcast. You know

306
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
what? I looked at it and I thought the

307
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,360
ego aside when I do that deal with them.

308
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,360
I would. Yeah, it's a good deal.
