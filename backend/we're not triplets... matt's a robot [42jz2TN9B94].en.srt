00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
a fast food place and you get

421
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,920

427
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,079
puppy came over and gave us our food it

428
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,639
was I thought it was going to bark I

429
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,040
wonder if we're going to become an

430
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,920
immortal species of human beings by by

431
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,839
like potions and like spells and stuff

432
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,360
going be or robots like I wonder which

433
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,920
rope will take like fantasy or

434
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,959
technology well I think that like we're

435
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,680
going to be able which one's going to

436
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,000
elongate like the human race is going to

437
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
either be like technology or like

438
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,400
fantasy and like Whimsical spells and

439
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,720
Stu am I going to be able to drink a

440
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
potion and then live forever or is there

441
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,240
going to be like a Droid that like

442
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,000
sticks a hard drive in like my neck or

443
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,199
okay and then I'm just like existing

444
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
forever cuz I have my hard drive

445
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,839
in dude the burger bot I genuinely think

446
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,079
like right now we should get that

447
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,200
patented because I agree you're not

448
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,280
patenting Burger bot you enter

449
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,880
McDonald's or Burger King or something

450
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,640
in like 20 years from now I will

451
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,360
guarantee you there will be a Burgery

452
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,679
with a burger b a burger you're nothing

453
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,320
with Burger bot dude me and burger bot

454
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,240
could take it to the Moon Matt I

455
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
don't think you really understand me and

456
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
burger bot can make it all the way you

457
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
literally are the burger bot kid I'm

458
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,799
talking to the Burger bot you're you're

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,480
literally right now talking to the same

460
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,960
software Burger bot's going to be built

461
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,120
off of so maybe close your

462
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,799
American cheddar or swiss like come on

463
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,080
yeah literal Burger bot remember the

464
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,159
episode of Sam and Cat where they would

465
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,600
go to the restaurant and it was like

466
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,799
call like Bots and bolts or something

467
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,760
and they would just get food served to

468
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,400
them by robots that's like I don't

469
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,679
understand how like wait another thing

470
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,520
with technology I don't get is like how

471
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,000
can this happen in movies but not

472
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,360
real life like if you're going to

473
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,080
 CGI Thanos and the

474
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,640
Infinity Gauntlet and like all this

475
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,559
and he's going to wipe out the universe

476
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,280
how can we CGI this that

477
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,000
doesn't exist that's what I want to know

478
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,760
like anything that should be CGI should

479
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,280
be possible Nick what the that's my

480
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,240
theory like if you have the technology

481
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,880
to virtually create it if I can watch

482
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,240
this why is it not real create it do use

483
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,840
more of that tech make it real Nick they

484
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,440
listening to they could virtually cut

485
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,159
you in half then put you back together

486
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
what does that even mean we need

487
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,440
more also side note totally side note

488
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,840
with technology and stuff we need shut

489
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,600
up dumb dumb

490
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,240
idiot you're little you're literally the

491
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,960
burger ball I'll lower your volume right

492
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,440
now I'll lower your volume I'm out of

493
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,120
breath now hold on what I'm saying is we

494
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,480
need we need more mad scientists

495
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,880
what like where where are the Mad

496
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,880
scientists that are that's what

497
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,360
I want to know who's inventing we

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,320
haven't had a i where's the newest

499
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,120
invention we haven't had a new

500
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,799
invention I want to see the wheel the

501
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,840
Cyber truck cyber truck who gives a

502
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,280

don't care what okay I don't care when

505
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,520
the new tech is like another car another

506
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,679
you want to see like a fly what I want

have emotions or just because you want

516
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000

517
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,880
have emotions or like a heart or

518
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,840

figured out to film a Friday video we

580
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,640
missed the podcast on Monday so we

581
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:32,200
didn't want to miss both in a row so we

582
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,559
made sure to film this um Matt should

583
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,840
