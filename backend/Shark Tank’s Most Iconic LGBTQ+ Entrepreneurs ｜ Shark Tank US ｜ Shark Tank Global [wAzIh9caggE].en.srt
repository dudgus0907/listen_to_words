Next up is a brand that merges function

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,629
with style.

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,000
Hi Sharks. My name is Braxton Fleming

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,119
and I'm from Maze Landing, New Jersey

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,200
and I'm seeking $200,000 in exchange for

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,719
15% equity of my company. Six years ago,

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,640
the trajectory of my whole life changed.

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,320
I realized I was transgender. With this

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
realization came with the lifelong

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
commitment of taking hormone replacement

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,719
therapy in the form of injections.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
During my first year of transitioning,

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,000
there was nowhere to properly store my

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,440
medical needs in a safe, neat, discreet,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,520
yet stylish way. That's where Stealth

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,359
Bros and Co. revolutionized the way that

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,479
we store our meds and dispose of our

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,280
sharps. This was born out of my own need

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,320
as a trans man. But I realized there

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,960
were multiple underrepresented medical

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
communities who needed this product. Who

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,840
do you know that's a diabetic? Or maybe

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840
you know someone going through

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,479
infertility treatment, a child with

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
injectable needs, or even cisgendered

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
individuals going through hormone

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,799
replacement therapy. All of these

30
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,079
underrepresented medical communities

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,200
need options to travel with confidence

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,280
for easy and proper atome storage.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,000
That's where our DOT kits and Stell

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,840
Sharp Shuttles come in and save the day.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
It's time to upgrade your plastic bags

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
in your old jugs

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,920
and store your meds in luxury. So,

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
sharks, who wants to fill the void of

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,799
millions of people and take a shot with

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Stealth Frozen Co., let's go.

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
Yes. So, we can have a look at this

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
here. Absolutely. Please open up your

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,360
bags and um take a look at what you

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
have. What do we have in front of us,

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
Preston? Okay. So what you have in front

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,599
of you is a junior do kit and a stealth

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,160
sharp shuttle inside. So the junior dot

48
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,040
kit that you have is our foundational

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,440
junior do kit which is in line with our

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
sword interior. And then Lori, you have

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,599
our premium do kit which is made with

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,520
our vegan faux leather. So your

53
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,560
medicines and everything can go in here.

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,239
The vials. Yes, that is for the vials.

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,080
What's a sharp? So a sharps is part of

56
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,319
your injectable needs. It's a needle.

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
It's a biohazard container. Put your

58
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,120
needle in. So, after I use the needle, I

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
put it in here. Yes. So, you just pop

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
this top open like this. And then it can

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,840
close. And you can open it and close it

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,680
multiple times. Once it's filled, then

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
you want to take that little latch at

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
the top, stick it in that compartment,

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,160
and then it locks permanently and then

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
you can discard it appropriately. So,

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,480
this is the disposable aspect of the

68
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
needles. Yes. But does only one come

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,360
with your kit? I would think you'd be

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,680
using these like crazy. So, yes, we

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
actually offer them in bundles. So, you

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
could buy it for 1, three, or five on my

73
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
website. And we just received a major

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
purchase order from a large retailer.

75
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
And they will be sold in a bundle pack

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,599
of four. There are other dot kits for

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
injectables, right? Cuz I've seen plenty

78
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,599
of. Yes. And so, you just made them more

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
fashionable, more fashion looking.

80
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,080
Correct. And same with the sharps. Um,

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,239
absolutely. But what was missing from

82
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,080
the other kits? And is it what Mark

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,120
said, you just made it more fashionable

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,159
and cool and what was missing was the

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
effect that it was daunting to take the

86
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,400
injection for me. Even though I'm a

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
nurse, I've been a nurse for the past 11

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,760
years. I realized that yes, I give

89
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
injections every day, but when I was

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,120
watching the YouTube videos online of my

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
community taking these injections, I was

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,920
realizing how much anxiety was bring it

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
was bringing them. And once I created

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,080
something that organized everything for

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
them, they weren't all over the place. I

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
want to bring an experience to the user.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I want them to feel good about

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,920
themselves. And this brings happiness to

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
my community, and that's what I'm trying

100
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,959
to do. How do you how do you reach your

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,479
community? How do you sell the product?

102
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,720
So, I sell the product all through

103
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,960
e-commerce and I just been growing

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
organically through influencer. Um, and

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,639
now would be a good time to ask you how

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,199
much have you sold year to date?

107
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
Currently, we're at 110,000. That's

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,520
good. And last year, what did you do,

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,080
Braxton? We did 147,000. So, we're up

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
40% currently right now. What does this

111
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
cost to make and what do you sell it

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,520
for? Okay. So, the one that you have

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,040
cost $5.80 for me and then I sell it for

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,759
34.

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,600
$34. That's a big margin on the sharp

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,680
stuff. What your cost is for one of

117
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
these. Okay. And what you're going to

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,680
sell the one, three, and four pack, I

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,199
guess. Okay. So, if we buy over 10,000

120
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,400
pieces of that, it's at 28. And then we

121
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,639
sell them for $4 on the website. And

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,759
then if you buy a pack of five, it's 15.

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,840
And what are you going to sell for

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
wholesale to the retailer? So, I sell it

125
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,960
to them for $7.50 and then they're

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,520
reselling it for $14.99. So 750 for a

127
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,440
pack of four and it cost you 28 cents.

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
Yes. Thank you. Mark's going to start

129
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
selling them. Braxton, can you tell us a

130
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,960
little bit about yourself and your

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,479
background and Absolutely. Absolutely.

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
So I actually come from two

133
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,639
entrepreneurial parents and um as I was

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,720
growing up I was very accepted in my

135
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
family. You know my parents love me.

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
They never judge me. They let me be

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
whoever I wanted to be. And at the age

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
of 27 years old I said something is

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,479
missing from my life. And that's when I

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,880
realized that I was transgender. And

141
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,759
once I made that change, as I was

142
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,360
watching YouTube videos of other trans

143
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
men taking hormone replacement

144
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,320
injections, that's how I realized that

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,320
there was a need for this. And I was

146
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,759
indirectly assessing them with my

147
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,960
nursing skills, saying, "Oh, that's not

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,320
safe." Like, they're putting it in shoe

149
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
boxes. They're putting it in plastic

150
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,759
bags. And that's when I said, "You know

151
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,800
what? I really want to become a part of

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,440
my community because they've given me so

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
much that I wanted to give back. I

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,680
created this brand and it just blew up.

155
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,280
Is it just you running the business?

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
It's all me. I do everything. I

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,039
literally work out of my basement right

158
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,400
now. I have all my product down there.

159
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,960
Are you still doing this completely out

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,600
of your basement? Yes, 100%. And are you

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
nursing still or? Yes, I actually been

162
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
trying to slow down because I've been

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,440
putting more effort into the business. I

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm just curious the logo Stealth

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Brothers and Company. Like when you came

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
out here, I thought it's a great name

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,039
now. Now that we know and understand it,

168
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,680
it's great. I'll explain the name.

169
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,680
Stealth is because I wanted people to be

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
able to keep their medication discreet.

171
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,759
No, I get the stealth part. Why the

172
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
brothers and company is we're built on

173
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,080
the foundation of the brotherhood of F

174
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,520
tom, female to male brotherhood. And

175
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,280
then N co is and communities that we

176
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
keep our allied communities. That's

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,840
great. And then the swords are there for

178
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
because iron sharpens iron and more than

179
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,599
one community coming together makes you

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,720
better and stronger. And that's Do you

181
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
have that up on your website? the

182
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,039
explanation. I actually do not. You

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
should. I should. Cool. Thank you.

184
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
That's very cool. And there should be a

185
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
video there of you explaining it because

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,199
the power of how you just explained it.

187
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,639
Yes. Yeah. That comes across very very

188
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,720
well. Thank you. I think that it's kind

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
of the the perfect kit and I love what

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,280
you're doing for the community. I don't

191
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,680
think you need a partner. I don't always

192
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
say that. I rarely say it. I think you

193
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,039
should run this. I think you should take

194
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
all the profit and I think you should

195
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
grow step by step and you're going to

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,199
have a wonderful business and reap what

197
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,160
you sew. And for those reasons, I wish

198
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,840
you good luck. But I'm out. Thank you,

199
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
Lori. I appreciate it. So, Brax, the

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,440
greatest part of your business, not to

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
diminish the other parts of your

202
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,800
business is really you. I mean, you

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,680
exude an incredible warmth. Thank you.

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,680
And personality that draws people to

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,599
you. Thank you. I think you've got a

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,160
good business.

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,080
just at the size you are right now just

208
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,720
not something for me. I'm out. I wish

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,280
you all the best. Thank you. Thank you.

210
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
I've had some personal experience when I

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
was trying to get pregnant. I was in

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,479
doing in vitro for seven years to give

213
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,960
birth to my first born, you know. Thank

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,919
God it worked. God bless you. I remember

215
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,400
being in business meetings, in museums,

216
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,319
in theaters where it's time to take my

217
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
big shot, right? It was just as big as

218
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,719
this with a big plunger. It was made of

219
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
oil that burned when it was horrible.

220
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,320
Yeah. U but the ingenious ways I had to

221
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,519
come up with just to hide that. Not that

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,440
I was ashamed, but what do you do with

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,000
the damn needle, right? You know, my

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,200
life had to go on. I used to carry books

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,519
with me, cut out pages in the middle,

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
cut a page, like a stop. Wow. Carry the

227
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,040
book and stick the needles in there

228
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,880
because you can't dispose in a restroom.

229
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,279
You can't throw it in a garbage can. But

230
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,000
let me tell you something. You have

231
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,399
genuine warmth and love that your pitch

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,240
comes from. You feel it all over. And

233
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,720
you know what? I'm a believer. If you're

234
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,440
that sincere and you come from that love

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,360
spot, people always do well and they

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,680
buy. They just buy. It's like a magic

237
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,839
wand. And I think it's terrific what you

238
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
do. Thank you so much, Barbara. Thank

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,560
you. I'm going to make you an offer,

240
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,320
okay, of $200,000, but I don't want to

241
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,880
put in all cash. I'm going to give you

242
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
$100,000 in a credit line, $100,000

243
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,440
cash. And I do want 20% of the business

244
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
cuz I want to feel happy when you do

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
well and make money. So, I'd like to be

246
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,560
part of that celebration with you. Yes.

247
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,080
Yeah. I I think it has merit. I think

248
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,000
you have made something much more

249
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
fashionable and interesting to own. I

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
get it. Barb, do you want any help or

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
you want to do it yourself? If you want

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
to jump in, I think it's a good cause.

253
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah, I'll split it with you if you

254
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,680
want. Yeah. Okay. I like the fact you

255
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120
know your numbers, right? Uh but it's

256
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
not a product that's going to fit for

257
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
me. Okay. But I wish you the best.

258
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
You're a good guy. The presentation is

259
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,760
very good. Thank you, Kevin. I'm out.

260
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
But you do have an offer from a

261
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,640
sharkette. and Marcus still I believe no

262
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm I'm I'm very interested and Barb and

263
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,000
I were talking from an operational

264
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,600
perspective it's not just a cash issue

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
it's building your business issue as

266
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,240
well because you're doing it yourself

267
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
trying to scale it from the basement to

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
a business is going to be a lot of work

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
and I think between our two

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,920
organizations we we can complement each

271
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,079
other to get you there and so if it

272
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,880
works with you Barb and I will split it

273
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,200
so it's going to be $200,000

274
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,760
a h 100,000 of that that in cash and

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,040
$100,000 of That is a line of credit for

276
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:38,360
20%. What do you think, Braxton? Wow,

277
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,360
that's amazing. What do you think? Um,

278
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
it wouldn't be right if I didn't count

279
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,720
her. So, are you guys willing to go to

280
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
18%.

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well,

282
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,839
you guys got a deal. You got

283
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,040
congratulations. Thank you so much.

284
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,480
It's such a pleasure. Thank you so much.

285
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,279
Thank you so much, Barb.

286
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,279
Thank you so much, everybody.

287
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,399
Next up is a fashion line for

288
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,399
selfexpression.

289
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,419
[Music]

290
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
Hello, my name is Skyler Ellers and I'm

291
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,240
the creator of one of the hottest

292
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,000
fashion trends on the internet. I'm

293
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,079
seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% of

294
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,120
my company.

295
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,839
Sharks, crochet takes us back to a time

296
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,200
when life was simpler and everything was

297
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,240
groovy. But most importantly, crochet

298
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,760
promotes positive vibes and makes people

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
happy.

300
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,240
And that's why I created my company,

301
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,560
Lord Von Schmidt.

302
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,480
My crochet designs are colorful,

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,279
sustainable, recycled, and repurposed.

304
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,880
But why take it from me when you can see

305
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,880
for yourselves? Hit it.

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,800
L'Oreal Indiana's outfits are aligned

307
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,519
with the slow fashion movement and come

308
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,440
with two fabulous accessories. Lower

309
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,440
carbon footprints and reduced weight.

310
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,560
[Laughter]

311
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Anna and Azerai are certain to be the

312
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,720
life of any party. Crochet is addictive.

313
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,920
You might get hooked on the attention.

314
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
There you go. There you go. That's the

315
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,839
money shot.

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,079
That is the money shot. David, that's

317
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,120
it. There he is. There you go. He takes

318
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,120
his LEDs for a spin and the crowd goes

319
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,120
wild.

320
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,079
Nasty, nasty. So, Sharks, who wants to

321
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,160
jump on board this groovy train with us?

322
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,760
I love it. Oh my goodness. I have some

323
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,560
handouts for you. Damon, you should try

324
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,040
it on. Robert, I'm a little husky, so I

325
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,040
would look like a piñata.

326
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,440
You would actually. I would look like a

327
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,680
piñata for sure. Thank you. Thank you so

328
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,600
much. Beautiful. Thank you. I love a

329
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,270
good crochet. Thanks, Skyler.

330
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,639
How's that look?

331
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,200
[Laughter]

332
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
What do you think, Skyler? Oh,

333
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,040
beautiful.

334
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:36,000
Mark, yours is a little low-waisted.

335
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,880
Wow. You want to do a boot pants on?

336
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
I like them.

337
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,600
I can't wear those. Do it. I like it.

338
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,000
David's walking a home run right now.

339
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Shake it, baby.

340
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,839
Whoa, that's hot. That is so hot.

341
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,120
You actually look really good in that,

342
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,120
Damon. It is a good look for you, Damon.

343
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,360
Interesting. Okay. Well, thanks so much

344
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,360
for trying them on. So, Skyler, tell us

345
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
about how you got into this. This looks

346
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,560
like a handmade art. And this is a

347
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,120
handmade art. Oh, it is entirely from

348
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,360
recycled crocheted blankets. Really? If

349
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,320
you're making them by hand, how can you

350
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,440
produce in quantity? Those are created

351
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,000
based on my crochet designs and they are

352
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
created in Asia. You outsource it. So,

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
you have a factory that's making them

354
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,920
for you. Yeah. Skyler, what do you sell

355
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,560
them for? So, the things that have been

356
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,399
manufactured are these parasols. And how

357
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
much is a parasol? To get a parasol to

358
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,839
the United States cost me $30, and I

359
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,760
sell them for $128 on my website. Wow.

360
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,959
And so, you have to get word out so

361
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
people know about this cuz we didn't

362
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,880
know about this on Shark Fake. Never

363
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,760
heard of Lord Von Schmidt. So Lord von

364
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,079
Schmidt started as my own weird little

365
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,199
project until suddenly it got picked up

366
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,600
on the internet and all of those blogs

367
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,160
ultimately culminated in a major

368
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,360
publicity boom that sold a ton of things

369
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,360
and mostly it was men's shorts made from

370
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,800
recycled Afghan blankets. How much are

371
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,880
the short shorts? Short shorts are $58.

372
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,519
What about the entire one? And then the

373
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,279
entire suit I can get 300. Wow. You

374
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,040
wearing those right now? Oh my. As a

375
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,959
matter of fact, I am. Dang.

376
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,800
Now, you seem like you're definitely a

377
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,920
fascinating and interesting person. You

378
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,959
have all our attention. What's your

379
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,079
background? So, I studied visual arts at

380
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,920
Columbia University. Nice. I was an

381
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,600
English teacher for years and I lived in

382
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Barcelona.

383
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,720
So, from there, I got into knitting and

384
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,360
crochet. Just typical what everybody

385
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,600
does.

386
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
When I came back from Barcelona, I saw

387
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,920
Afghan blankets in the thrift store.

388
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,720
America has a ton of Afghans. We have a

389
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,480
glut of Afghans. So, I created these and

390
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,720
I put them up on my Etsy shop. Okay. And

391
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,279
then I took a little trip to India. All

392
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,839
of a sudden, I saw this bizarre spike in

393
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,079
men's shorts, which I hadn't sold a ton

394
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,959
of prior to that. And by the time I had

395
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,480
300 open orders for shorts, I had to

396
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,560
leave India and go back to the United

397
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
States to make them. I went to thrift

398
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,920
store after thrift store. Cut them up,

399
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
sewed them together. Cut them up, sewed

400
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,560
them together. How many orders did you

401
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,199
get on the shorts? Total total more than

402
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,440
300. 325. So, who's buying these? Like,

403
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,519
what is your demographic? My demographic

404
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,920
is a lot of people who go to summer

405
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,399
festivals. There's a very large LGBTQIA

406
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,720
plus contingent that follows this

407
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
fashion. Are you making any money today?

408
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,920
What are your sales? My sales are

409
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,399
188,000 so far this year. When did for

410
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,880
for four years? For four years. What

411
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,880
about last year? Last year was 37,000.

412
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay. So, it's a small kind of hobby.

413
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
Your full-time job. Is this your full?

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,959
It is my full-time job. I live on that.

415
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,839
You're starving to death.

416
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,799
That's nothing. I can stretch money

417
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,439
really far. But but Skyler, if I'm going

418
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,839
to give you a $100,000,

419
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,160
that's like 10 years of sales for you.

420
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,839
It's crazy. You have to have a plan to

421
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,640
blow this thing up. I want to hear the

422
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,400
plan. The plan is to take the pieces

423
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
that I like the best and especially

424
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,319
something like this thong, which can be

425
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,520
produced very cheaply. How many have you

426
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,200
sold of the thong of the thongs? 10. But

427
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
I came out with them this summer. These

428
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
are basically works of art where you put

429
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,240
your heart and soul into it, right? So

430
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,840
why not charge more? A lot of times when

431
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,760
people see something and it costs more

432
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,760
than they expect, how they value it goes

433
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,600
way up. How's he going to make a living

434
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
though? You need to be able to make a

435
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,799
living off of this. He really has to do

436
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,200
it in mass mark because he won't

437
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,640
make money off. The only way this works

438
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,720
is if you sell that jumpsuit for $1,000

439
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,760
or more. I and I can't. You should have

440
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,600
no pieces that cost less than $250. If

441
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,160
you're charging 60 bucks, 80 bucks is

442
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,960
just a piece of clothing. Be an artist.

443
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,039
Sell it as artwork. You hand make each

444
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,840
and every one of these things. It's a

445
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,000
piece of art. Sell it that way. Oh, I

446
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,640
agree. For my handmade work, I totally

447
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,400
agree. You're still not charging enough.

448
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,559
You don't have to sell a ton of these

449
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
when they're art.

450
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,640
You only have to sell seven. What are

451
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,320
you doing, Mark? I I'm out. But I think

452
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,160
it's a great opportunity for you, but

453
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,760
you just got to be an artist that's

454
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
proud of their work and has some

455
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,919
confidence that it'll sell for a huge

456
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,919
price.

457
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,960
Skyler, being a great artist is not

458
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,400
enough. $37,000

459
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,840
is really insignificant. It's a start.

460
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
It's a start. But for me to give you a

461
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,000
hundred,000, you got to get this to half

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,280
a million. You got to get to a million.

463
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,440
And that is less art and creative.

464
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,880
That's art and business. There's no

465
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,600
plan. I'm out. I'm sorry.

466
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,280
As much as I love all of this, I want to

467
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
put my heart and soul into it and give

468
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
the very best that I can. And

469
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
unfortunately here, I just don't think

470
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,200
that this is like right for me. So, I'm

471
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,880
sorry I'm out.

472
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Scott, I think we've all pretty much

473
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,360
agreed in the same way. I mean, you

474
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,280
remind me very much of myself. I stood

475
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
in the corner and I sold $800 worth of

476
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,160
hats. And I realized at that point I

477
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,240
will never work for anybody ever again

478
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,919
for the rest of my life. But it took me

479
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,280
10 years to figure it out from that day.

480
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,000
And I just don't think you have it

481
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,400
figured out yet. But you will never work

482
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,919
for anybody for the rest of your life.

483
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,640
But right now it's too early. I'm out.

484
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,000
Skyler, you had all the components that

485
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,720
you need on Shark Tank. A brilliant

486
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,880
idea. The face of it. Missing is a

487
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,799
person telling me, "Look, Skylar's doing

488
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,000
all this. Meanwhile, I'm back in India.

489
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,200
I've got logistics. I've got

490
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,559
distribution. I'm dealing with the

491
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,240
retailers we're going to work with. You

492
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,559
need that partner, whoever it is.

493
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,039
They're not there. I would love to give

494
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,080
you $100,000. I would love to give you

495
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,720
more. I mean, this this thing I'm not

496
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,720
going to because there's uninvestable.

497
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,160
It's uninvestable. There's there's no

498
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,600
way to make it. My guy

499
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,679
Thank you, guys.

500
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,360
But there's, you know, I I am an

501
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
investor and I got to get it back. I'm

502
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,240
just frustrated and I'm sorry to say I'm

503
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
out, but you're one hell of a guy, Lord

504
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,559
Von Schmidt.

505
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,640
Thanks, guys. Congrats, Skyler. Go in

506
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,240
peace. You're worth a lot to me. They

507
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
really do. All right, come on, guys.

508
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Let's boogie on out of here. Boogie on.

509
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Bye.

510
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,650
Next into the tank is a brand seeking to

511
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,239
be a better fit for all.

512
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:53,239
[Music]

513
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,640
Hi Sharks. I'm Sherice and this is my

514
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,520
wife Vicki. We're from San Diego,

515
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,440
California, seeking $250,000 for 5%

516
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,039
equity in our company. When you go

517
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,200
clothes shopping, most stores have a

518
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,200
men's section and a women's section. But

519
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Sharks, neither of those sections work

520
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,039
for me. The women's section tends to

521
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
have more form fitting clothes, which I

522
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,440
like, but I don't. And while I love the

523
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,400
men's style, those clothes are just not

524
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,919
made for my body shape. Sharks, she's

525
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,760
got a booty. True story. We're all

526
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
unique individuals, and we believe the

527
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,919
shopping experience should be based on

528
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,480
style preference and body type, not on

529
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,520
gender. That's why we decided to forge

530
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,360
the future of fashion with Dapper Boy, a

531
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,679

537
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,960
Sharks, in front of you, some Dapper Boy

538
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,600
clothes we love for you to check out.

539
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,840
Good for you guys. Thank you. I'm really

540
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,080
intrigued. I mean, you sell direct to

541
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,000
consumer because you're asking retailers

542
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,679
to create a third category, right?

543
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,760
Right. And you know, obviously we're not

544
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,600
opposed to creating this third category

545
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,600
or not, but right now we feel like

546
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
direct to consumer is the way to go,

547
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,600
especially, you know, with being

548
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,240
missiondriven brand and just being easy

549
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
to shop online. Good looking stuff. So,

550
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,039
are you blowing it up on social or how

551
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,799
are you getting the word out to your

552
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,360
community? Yeah, so Facebook and

553
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,039
Instagram mostly. Um, we're excited to

554
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
start dabbling to some influencer

555
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,240
marketing as well. How did you come up

556
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,159
with this? I used to shop in the women's

557
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,559
department and those styles were just

558
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,720
never for me. I never felt confident. I

559
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,200
felt frumpy. I felt unseen. But we

560
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,360
started Dapper seven years ago now. And

561
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,039
literally, it came from a pair of jeans.

562
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,039
Jeans was the first thing I tried on in

563
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,120
the men's department. And it was the

564
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,600
scariest thing to go to that section,

565
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
you know, to maybe be judged. Um, but it

566
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,039
was exactly what I wanted to be. It was

567
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
like the confidence I wanted. That was

568
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,880
my style, you know, it was emotional.

569
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
But years later, I realized those

570
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,360
clothes just never fit my body type. And

571
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,600
so we we saw a bunch of people just like

572
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,360
myself with the same exact problem. So I

573
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,440
guess that your sales are less than a

574
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,039
million. Please

575
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,679
don't be wrong. So lifetime sales in the

576
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,120
last seven years, we've done about 3.5.

577
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,120
And actually the way we've run our

578
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,720
business is uh pre-order campaigns.

579
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,200
That's very good. So we bootstrapped the

580
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,400
brand. In last year we were at 1.2.

581
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah. Oops. I got you. So why don't we

582
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,080
get into the margins? What do you uh

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,559
what's an average marginal? Take this

584
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,559
shirt for example. Yeah, that shirt is

585
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,039
uh $9.40

586
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,919
and we sell it for 60. Landed price for

587
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,600
jeans $15. We sell them for $99. Nice.

588
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,200
What did you mean when you referenced a

589
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
pre-order campaign? How does that work?

590
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,880
Yeah. So, how we were able to bootstrap

591
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,880
is that we launched these products at

592
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
what we call intro pricing. So, it's

593
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,559
usually about a 50% margin at that

594
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,559
point. And that really creates a sense

595
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,280
of urgency within our customers. Our

596
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,799
repeat customer rate is 51%. These

597
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,559
people are waiting for our products to

598
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,159
come in. And how does it how do you

599
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,159
execute that exactly? I've never heard

600
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,320
that. So, we launch a product, we put

601
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,840
out on email, social, everywhere, and

602
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
then the customers go ahead and

603
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,159
pre-order the product and we usually

604
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,320
deliver within 6 to 10 weeks. But I will

605
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
admit here co, you know, killed us.

606
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
Right now with the co delays, we're

607
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,080
seeing six, seven months. Ouch. Wow. And

608
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,240
so, how much do you have in inventory

609
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,159
right now? 60 grand. Okay. But it's

610
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,000
across a lot of sizes and that's what

611
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,880
makes it tough. How much cash do you

612
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,720
guys have? Well, maybe $100 today. $100?

613
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,520
What? $100? I'm not Yep. We're at the

614
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,200
point here where uh we just sold our

615
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,240
house. Oh, no. It's It's uh vulnerable

616
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,159
and not fun to talk about, but we

617
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,159
believe in this brand like more than

618
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,039
anything. So far, you're losing money,

619
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,360
right? Yes. Okay. So, this How much

620
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,120
money are you on intro pricing? It's

621
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,720
killing your margin. Yeah. Wait, Kevin.

622
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,520
Kev, how much money are you losing?

623
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,279
Yeah, so I think we're about 150,000 ne

624
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,120
uh negative this year. What did you lose

625
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,039
last year? Uh 313. So you're 450 in the

626
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,799
hole, right? Yeah, guys, something

627
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,279
doesn't add up for me. Yeah, right.

628
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,880
Because your margins are like this and

629
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,200
your shipping cost shouldn't be that

630
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
astronomical. What happened was is I

631
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
also started spending in marketing. I

632
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,679
hired a consultant. That's where you

633
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,360
went wrong. Exactly. So how much did you

634
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,840
spend on marketing? I would say, you

635
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,480
know, it was definitely over 30% of Oh

636
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,159
my god. So, you have this rabid

637
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,240
community that wants to buy from you.

638
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,400
You don't need to market them. It was

639
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,960
our attempt and it was a wrong attempt

640
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
to try to expand and go further, but we

641
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,760
were not ready for that. We will be

642
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,520
ready for that, but not now. And that's

643
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,520
why we need experts like you guys to

644
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,360
come on board. The reason why the people

645
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,240
are waiting six and seven or eight

646
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,159
months is like you said, it it's a

647
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,840
community. It's a it's a movement. It

648
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,720
it's funny that fubu uh for us bias has

649
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,159
become used a lot in the LGBTQ plus

650
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,799
community. Am I right? And

651
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,360
you are for us bias. You know that

652
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,039
that's that's who you are. Why are you

653
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,279
trying to go any place else? If other

654
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,799
people adopt it, it's no problem. But

655
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,880
why are you going any place else?

656
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,440
There's so many people that identify

657
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
with you right now. Stop trying to be

658
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,960
everything to everybody. You know, I I

659
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,679
have to I have to argue that. And it's

660
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,320
because I don't want to be categorized.

661
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,159
I want to fit in with everybody.

662
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Listen, I'm Listen, I'm pro black. I'm

663
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
never anti anything else. Of course, it

664
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,240
doesn't mean that other people won't

665
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
accept you. So, I have to be I have to

666
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
be honest. I have to give you my

667
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,840
assessment of the business. I got to try

668
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,960
to find a way to help you. I'll mentor

669
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,919
you. But as for the business, I'm out.

670
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,919
Thank you. You guys, I like to sit here

671
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,400
and say I've done a million products,

672
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,720
and I have, and I've done something in

673
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,400
just about every medium, but the one

674
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,720
thing I've really never done is jeans,

675
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,120
clothing. I don't know how I could bring

676
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,760
value to your business and help you out.

677
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,039
So, unfortunately, I wish you good luck,

678
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,880
but I'm out. Thank you very much. I

679
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,760
understand your mission. I respect it.

680
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,840
There is such a need for this, but I

681
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
think your problem is much larger

682
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,520
cashwise than you envision it to be.

683
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,279
Even you came in here when we gave you

684
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,080
the $250,000

685
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,240
for your stock. That's nothing that's

686
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,480
not going to get you over the hump. It's

687
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,360
just it's a rough one. So, I wish I

688
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,880
could be with you, but I am now.

689
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,799
I wanted to mention one other thing, and

690
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,279
it's pretty important here. We're about

691
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,279
to do a collaboration with another brand

692
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,360
that does jeans, and they do 3D

693
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,919
modeling. So what happens with that is

694
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,080
that guys guys don't do that. Don't do

695
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,760
the collaboration. No, you have a

696
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,120
fundamental problem. You don't know what

697
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,480
business you're in. You have this

698
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,960
community that's like this. Your clothes

699
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,200
are not the product. The community is

700
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,760
looking to your your clothes as their

701
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,399
membership as the way that they for them

702
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,039
to say we all belong together. That this

703
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,559
is us. The clothes are secondary. It's

704
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,159
keeping the community together that's

705
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,039
important. But I have a fundamental

706
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,960
problem as an investor because we're not

707
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,399
on the same page on what makes the

708
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,760
business. It's about I want more

709
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
inventory. I've got this collaboration.

710
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,200
I've got all these other things. That's

711
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
not the vision I would have. And it's

712
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,720
your vision that's far more important.

713
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,799
So for those reasons, I'm out.

714
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,120
You're you're not only all in, you're

715
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,600
all in 2,00%. There's only one

716
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,679
direction. Yes. It's up to the surface

717
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,840
so you can breathe some oxygen. That is

718
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,840
not a wonderful place for an investor to

719
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,159
be. Right. I wish you guys the best of

720
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,080
luck, but I know.

721
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,320
Yeah. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Thank

722
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,720
you very much. Fighting. God bless you.

723
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,039
Let me give you this. Yes. This is my

724
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,080
number. So, good luck. Thank you very

725
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:47,399
much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.

726
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,399
Thank you guys.

727
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,840
I think the Sharks reminded us that our

728
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,600
community is is everything. It's not the

729
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,919
end of Dapper Boy. And you know what? At

730
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,000
the end of the day, we came here to

731
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
build a relationship and I'm so happy

732
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,679
that we walked out of here with

733
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,240
hopefully a mentorship. Yes. So that's

734
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,240
huge. Yes.
