1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
In the first day, I think we added like

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,240
60K. I remember one of our engineers was

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,440
like, "Guys, we added 60K today. Oh my

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
god." And you I jumped in was like,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
"Yep, it's cool, but like this is, you

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,000
know, this is like launch day. This is

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,719
going to go away." And that didn't

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,119
happen. Every single day, we kept adding

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,039
more and more ARR. In the first 2

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,199
months, we went from 0 to 20 million of

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
ARR. Everyone we were talking to had

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,920
never seen anything like it. We were

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
actually we were going to go out of

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,680
business last year. You know, we spent

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,679
seven years building out the core

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,279
technology of the product. couldn't

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,840
figure out how to actually effectively

18
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,760
monetize it. We had one last experiment

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
that we ran um is it's a product called

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,640
Bolt. Finding product market fit. It is

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,399
purely how many people you talk to. It

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
is purely that you people there maybe

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,440
early in their product career to kind of

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,039
have lots of cool ideas about things

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,280
they could build and whatever that are

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
not really attached to the reality of

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,520
the actual end user customer using the

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
product, what they're trying to do with

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,399
it, the challenges they're currently

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,879
running into with it. One of the things

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,160
we really invested in early on with Bolt

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,600
was like community. You know, we've

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,920
hired in a couple of folks who their

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
entire job is just talking to our users.

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
And so I think that's really the only

36
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
way you can meaningfully scale the full

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
cycle of user feedback is just having

38
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
great people that are in your community

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
or on your actual core team. That's

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
their entire job and they're all working

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
together. You have to learn how to be

42
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
intellectually honest with yourself. And

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
it's like, am I not giving up because

44
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
that's what people say you should do, or

45
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
am I not giving up because I actually

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,759
really like I have conviction in this

47
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,080
and like I just want to see this I I

48
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,079
really want to see this made possible. I

49
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,240
I think the only way I learned how to

50
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,680
determine when it was time to pivot

51
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,680
versus time to iterate was just

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm Eric Simons. I'm the co-founder and

53
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
CEO of Stack Blitz and we're the

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
creators of Bolt. new. People went to

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,280
bolt.new, typed in the idea of a website

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
or whatever that they wanted to make,

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
hit enter, and 30 seconds later, they

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
had a a web application ready to go.

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,520
First two months of launching Bolt, we

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,520
went from 0 to 20 million of ARR. The 3

61
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
months since then, we've added another

62
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,240
20 million of ARR just about, and we now

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,080
have almost 4 million registered users

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,080
and are continuing to grow like a weed.

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,640
I like computers from a pretty early

66
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,160
age. I was like building computers like

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,280
be gaming computers and that sort of

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
thing. That was actually when my

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,560
co-founder and I met was when we were

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,280
you I think around 12 or 13. The first

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,360
product that my co-founder and I built.

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,200
We basically built a version of Dropbox

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,800
before Dropbox existed. And this is back

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,239
in like 2006 or 7. At that time, the way

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,760
that you kind of bring your digital

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
documents between school and home was

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,599
like USB flash drives. You're like 12 or

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,720
13 or whatever. You're going to forget

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,000
this, right? You're going to leave this

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
at home. Happened all the time. And so

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,040
we had the idea of like, hey, let's just

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
make a digital storage service that

83
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,480
people can upload their homework to or

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
whatever. And it took off like wildfire

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,080
like the entire many school districts in

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Illinois and just kind of across the

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
Midwest started using this thing. I

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,800
think at that time I was I was like 18

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
or 19. I for come out Silicon Valley. We

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
had gone through one of these

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
accelerator program. At that time they

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
would give you like 20K. So we went

93
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
through that money and then we're out of

94
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
money but we the product wasn't ready to

95
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,319
launch. And so I was like what do you

96
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
do? We just so happened to had access to

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,840
the AOL building at that time because

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
one of our investors said was renting

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,040
office space out of there. So I had a

100
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,959
key card to get into the AOL building

101
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
and so there's couches here, you know, I

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
could sleep on the couch, there's a gym

103
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
and so they have showers. I was 19.

104
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,400
Expectations for quality of of living

105
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,840
are pretty low, I think, at that age.

106
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,519
And so I I ended up just, you know,

107
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
starting to live out of out of their

108
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,040
headquarters. I I would I was just

109
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,720
coding from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

110
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
12:00 p.m. I did that for like I think

111
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
like 4 months um until they they

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
eventually someone like someone finally

113
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
caught on that I was living in their

114
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,159
headquarters and they they found me and

115
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,519
threw me out at like 5:00 in the

116
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,519
morning. I didn't know anyone in Silicon

117
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,159
Valley. I'm not from California. I went

118
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,640
and like slept on a table at Starbucks

119
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,720
until they opened.

120
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,760
Thinking was a company that we didn't

121
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
really intend to be a company.

122
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
Basically, we had a whole bunch of

123
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
different startup ideas we were trying

124
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,599
on the side. We were building lots of

125
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
different web applications as a result

126
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,959
for each of these startups to stay

127
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,879
afloat. We were like, "Okay, you know,

128
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
we actually know a lot about building

129
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,400
web applications cuz we're we're doing

130
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,560
it so much. We could probably like teach

131
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,239
folks online and, you know, charge for

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
like our courses and and make money to

133
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,440
keep us afloat so we can keep trying

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
other ideas." Kind of the funny thing is

135
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
like of all the things we were working

136
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,000
on at that time, Thinkster was the most

137
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,000
successful of all of them. We were

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
teaching a lot of people. We had like I

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
think it's at like 100,000 something

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
people that were you know using this

141
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
site uh to learn how to do web

142
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,160
development. And the biggest problem the

143
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
people learning were having. I mean this

144
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
is common with anyone that's learning

145
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
how to program is not even like learning

146
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
how to write the code but it's actually

147
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
setting up your development environment

148
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
which is basically mean setting up your

149
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
computer to be able to even like run

150
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,560
code. That is a huge huge huge challenge

151
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
whether you're like a beginner or you're

152
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
an advanced developer. We were running

153
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
into this problem with the people using

154
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Thinkster of they they just couldn't get

155
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
the stuff set up in their environment to

156
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
even learn how to write the code. And we

157
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
had the realization like okay actually

158
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,040
it should be possible theoretically to

159
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
just kind of like run an entire dev

160
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,720
environment inside of the browser

161
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
itself. You know not using servers, not

162
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,759
install anything locally like we can

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440
actually run it in a web page, you know,

164
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,240
inside of a browser tab. And we were

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
looking at all these different

166
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
technologies that have released in

167
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
browsers and we were like someone must

168
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,840
have done this already, right? Like cuz

169
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,199
we we were just trying to solve our own

170
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,800
problem. We weren't trying to start a

171
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
company like we were just trying to

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,479
teach people on Thinkster. We looked

173
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
around and there was just nothing. There

174
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,759
is nothing that could actually do it. I

175
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,759
kind of knew that this is like something

176
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
very different at that point because it,

177
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,960
you know, it's like I'd never run it

178
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
across something like this where I kind

179
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,479
of technically knew the underpinnings

180
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,919
that this should be possible, but yet no

181
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
one had gone and done it. That key

182
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,360
insight was really what led us to start

183
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,199
stacks cuz we were like, "Okay, well

184
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
that would be huge for people learning

185
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,160
how to code to not have to set up

186
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
environments. It would make it way more

187
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,000
accessible. people could just use this

188
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,360
as an environment to just keep building

189
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,199
in like why would you even need to set

190
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
up a local environment necessarily. So

191
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,000
that was kind of the origin story of

192
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,000
stacks and it came out of thankster

193
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
directly.

194
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
We had spent half a decade building

195
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,039
building out this technology. The the

196
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,199
problem is that anyone that really

197
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,800
understands how to write software

198
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,199
already knows how to get stuff set up on

199
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
their local computer and will tend to

200
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,120
actually just gravitate towards that

201
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,479
because they are super familiar with it.

202
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
The issue is if you're going to build

203
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,280
something that's web- based that is

204
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
getting people to actually leave their

205
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,440
their environment is a huge challenge.

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
We tried out a whole bunch of different

207
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,720
experiments um over the course of the

208
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,160
past, you know, 2 years or whatever. All

209
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,199
of them were very cool. generally like

210
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
the people that that try these things

211
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,880
out thought they were really awesome but

212
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
it didn't move the needle from like a a

213
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,319
monetization standpoint. My co-ounder

214
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
and I have like talked about you know do

215
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
should we pack it in shut down the

216
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,199
company and so that was you know like

217
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,800
last year we made the decision my

218
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
co-founder and I um with our with our

219
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,919
board and stuff of like okay we're going

220
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,319
to spend the rest of this year going and

221
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,560
trying everything that we think is cool

222
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,960
idea and and if that doesn't work out

223
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,880
we'll have left no stone unturned and

224
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,880
we'll go and kind of prepare to kind of

225
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,560
start spinning things down. How would I

226
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,560
walk away from this knowing that I I

227
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
gave it everything I had? Like last year

228
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
when as this was kind of going on with

229
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,360
the company, I also had my first child

230
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
and if you talk to anyone that has a

231
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
kid, you don't get a lot of sleep. It's

232
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
pretty high stress. So, I had a lot of

233
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
challenges kind of going on just from

234
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,360
the personal side, the work side. I woke

235
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,720
up one morning last April after my

236
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,240
daughter was born and I was like, I'm

237
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
going to do an iron man, like a full

238
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
iron man. And and I and it was like 6

239
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,120
months from that. I never ran a marathon

240
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,599
or whatever. the six months um you know

241
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,440
of last year I was kind of bringing full

242
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
intensity to every part of my life like

243
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,840
physically going and training for this

244
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,840
thing mentally with with my job uh going

245
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,599
and you know really figuring out leaving

246
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
no stone unturned and just trying a lots

247
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,639
of different experiments etc and so kind

248
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
of bringing full intensity to those

249
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,599
things and and I got to tell you I've

250
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
never been happier in my life um I've

251
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,840
never been happier in my life really

252
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,280
investing in in myself my co-workers and

253
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,599
my products and my family and my

254
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,160
business with just such uh intense

255
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,960
dedication and I is okay with whatever

256
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,000
the outcome was. If we end the year and,

257
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,479
you know, our destiny is the same, so be

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,800
it. Let the the universe, you know, let

259
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,400
the universe decide, right? Um, I've

260
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
done everything that I possibly can do.

261
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,560
And Bolt was like the last the last

262
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
experiment we had before we're going to

263
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
kind of start winding things down. Uh,

264
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
what Bolt allows you to do is like to

265
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,560
actually, you know, using just text, you

266
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
can type in an idea of an app or a

267
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,000
website you want, it'll build it. The

268
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
launch strategy for Bolt was like we put

269
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
out a tweet. Like that was it. There was

270
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
no blog post. There's no press release.

271
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,160
So there's just like a tweet and and

272
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
that tweet ended up going viral. So what

273
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640
ended up happening is people they saw

274
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
our tweet, they went to bolt.new, typed

275
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,560
in the idea of a website or whatever

276
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,800
that they wanted to make, hit enter, and

277
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,719
30 seconds later they had a a web

278
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,120
application ready to go. In the first

279
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,399
day, I think we added like 60K. I

280
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
remember one of our engineers was like,

281
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,920
"Guys, we added 60K today. Oh my god."

282
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,279
And you I jumped in was like, "Yep, it's

283
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,800
cool, but like this is, you know, this

284
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,720
is like launch day. This is going to go

285
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,600
away." And that didn't happen. Every

286
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,680
single day, we kept adding more and more

287
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,320
ARR. In the first 2 months, we went from

288
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
0 to 20 million of ARR. Everyone we were

289
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
talking to had never seen anything like

290
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:10,920
it. It was, I mean, just an unbelievable

291
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,920
shift in the destiny of of our company.

318
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,839
So I'd actually had the idea for Bolt

319
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,839
about a year ago, February of 24. At

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,839
that time, the Frontier models like

321
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,040
OpenAI or whatever have you. You we had

322
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
actually tried to build a prototype with

323
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
Bolt. We spent a couple of weeks doing

324
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
that. What we ended up finding was the

325
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
output just was not good enough. Like

326
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
you would tell it to build an app and it

327
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
just oftent times it would be broken or

328
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
it wouldn't look good. it wouldn't

329
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
function properly, which kind of like

330
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
ruins the experience. So, we we put that

331
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,399
project on the shelf and we're like,

332
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
"Okay, maybe we'll come back to this at

333
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,800
some point in the future when when these

334
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,959
AI models get better." Back in May, we

335
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,240
just so happened to kind of get a sneak

336
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,120
preview of the new stuff that was coming

337
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
from Enthropic with Sonnet 3.5 coding

338
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
model that has changed software

339
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
development period. You we got a kind of

340
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,839
sneak peek of it and we were like, "This

341
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,519
is good. I mean, this is going to change

342
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,760
everything we think." And so we kind of

343
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,839
pulled the pulled bull off the shelf and

344
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,600
yeah took the the latest APIs from

345
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
Enthropic pulled them together and

346
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,240
launched it within 90 days of that back

347
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,680
after chatbt had launched a lot of

348
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
companies were just kind of like adding

349
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
AI stuff to their products and not even

350
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
in a very thoughtful way but it was kind

351
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
of like people just wanted to be like

352
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
relevant and kind of you know show that

353
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
they were had an AI strategy and we

354
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,760
didn't cuz we were just like we don't

355
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,279
see the value of this. it's not clear

356
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,160
how this is actually going to make the

357
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,480
experience that much better, right? And

358
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,120
all of our competitors went were you

359
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
churning on AI ideas. We held off u

360
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,399
because we just didn't see we didn't

361
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
have conviction on it. I think in in

362
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,240
retrospect the right move and when we

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
did find the right thing, we went all

364
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
in. And you kind of look at like the

365
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,519
competitors that we were going up

366
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
against then versus now it's like a lot

367
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
of them have either shut down some of

368
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,399
them have kind of started to pivot to AI

369
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,320
but like from like a user and revenue

370
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,560
perspective it's like bolt is the number

371
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,560
one thing

372
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,680
you know we get thousands of emails and

373
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,680
tickets and tweets and etc per day

374
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,399
sorting the the signal from the noise is

375
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,160
is you know very difficult challenge But

376
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,240
one of the things we really invested in

377
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,240
early on with Bolt was like community.

378
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
Like we have a very great community

379
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
around Bolt where you know folks really

380
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,079
love the product and there's these

381
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,160
people that that are really smart,

382
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,519
genuine, awesome folks that have stepped

383
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
up and really became like kind of

384
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,320
leaders in this community. Yeah. So

385
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,399
that's really how we've been able to

386
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
scale the both the support but also the

387
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
product feedback function because these

388
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,920
are folks that are like in our Discord

389
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
or Reddit or Twitter or whatever and

390
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,040
they're hearing what people are running

391
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
into. then they themselves might be

392
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
running into it and they'll and they'll

393
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,200
be like, "Hey, this is something we're

394
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
hearing a lot of. Here's maybe how you

395
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,120
you guys go about fixing it, etc." And

396
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,399
we also have people on our team who, you

397
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,800
know, we've hired in a couple of folks

398
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
who their entire job is just talking to

399
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,480
our users, helping them get unstuck with

400
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
stuff, hearing their feedback, etc. And

401
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,839
so, I think that's really the only way

402
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,760
you can meaningfully scale, you know,

403
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,000
uh, support and and the the full cycle

404
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
of user feedback is just having great

405
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,920
people that are in your community or,

406
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
you know, on your uh, actual core team.

407
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,480
That's their entire job and they're all

408
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,079
working together. You know, just bring

409
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
in all the data points, make good

410
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,560
decisions, and get the proper things

411
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,440
prioritized in the product. We like to

412
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,200
work on things that users have

413
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,760
specifically either like really asked

414
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,839
for where it's a big a big pain point or

415
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,079
alternatively, it's something that we've

416
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,880
validated that people want. I think it's

417
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,920
very easy for entrepreneurs and yeah,

418
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,360
people that are maybe early in their

419
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
product career to kind of have lots of

420
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
cool ideas about things they could build

421
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,120
and whatever that are not really

422
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,600
attached to the reality of the actual

423
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
end user customer using the product,

424
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,240
what they're trying to do with it, the

425
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,000
challenges they're currently running

426
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,279
into with it. And so a lot of this comes

427
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,639
down to just experience and like

428
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,000
fortunately we've been doing this for a

429
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
long time. Like my co-founder and I have

430
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,839
been building stuff for almost 20 years.

431
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,120
You know, having a good sense of these

432
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,800
are cool ideas, but we should probably

433
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,480
get to them later. These are really

434
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,920
important ideas. We should do them now.

435
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
These are really important high priority

436
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,399
things. They need to be fixed and you

437
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,399
know uh sorting accordingly

438
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,000
and and one of the interesting things

439
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,160
too actually about what we did is we

440
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
actually open sourced the core version

441
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,680
of bullet when we launched and like even

442
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,680
today it's like I think it's like the

443
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,519
most popular AI product you know by

444
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,880
users of revenue that actually has an

445
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,279
open source version. Like there's

446
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,120
nothing else out there that really has

447
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,560
that other than us. But it was clear to

448
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
us was like this is this is knowledge

449
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
that someone's going to open source this

450
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,320
at some point and we think it'll just be

451
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
actually a lot better for us and the AI

452
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,639
model providers etc. if this is

453
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,880
available for people to try out and fork

454
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,399
and improve and whatever have you which

455
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
ended up being a really key decision cuz

456
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,839
a lot of people use Bolt because they

457
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
can play around with the open source

458
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,000
version and fork fork it and make it

459
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,480
better and you know whatever have you.

460
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,480
We've invested a ton in the open- source

461
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,800
world in large part because like our

462
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,040
product really wouldn't work without

463
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,480
amazing open source software that's been

464
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,800
built for web development and and

465
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,639
otherwise. For us, it's you it's also

466
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
really important that that those people

467
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
building different web development tool

468
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
chains like Vit or whatever have you

469
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
also care about us and they want to make

470
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,519
sure that their these open source

471
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
projects work well in our technology and

472
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,800
our environment. And that's been really

473
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,440
key for us. Yeah, we became the largest

474
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,279
backer of Vit back in 2021. We have

475
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
multiple people on our team that all

476
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,360
they do is work on open source full-time

477
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,279
you. So I think uh developers love our

478
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,600
products. I think in some part because

479
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,079
we genuinely care about open source and

480
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,839
ensuring that folks uh working on open

481
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,440
source get compensated and have a way to

482
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,839
actually continue working on it in a

483
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,839
sustainable way.

484
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
I I think the only way I learned how to

485
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,959
determine when it was time to pivot

486
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,040
versus time to iterate was just trying a

487
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,639
lot of startup ideas. like that was you

488
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,800
over the course of like a decade through

489
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,959
that I kind of I I ended up building a

490
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,639
good gut instinct of when when we were

491
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,240
kind of at the end of the line on a

492
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,600
certain idea and it was like okay we

493
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,079
need to like pivot and try something

494
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,560
else instead. So my recommendation would

495
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,800
be to to if you think you need to go

496
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,079
deep on something and go along, do it.

497
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,199
And typically you're gonna you're you're

498
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,720
eventually going to find out one way or

499
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,920
the other if you were right or wrong and

500
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,199
then you learn from that. And and then

501
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,040
then if you were wrong, if you're like,

502
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,639
"Hey, we went really deep and it didn't

503
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,199
pan out." You have to just take that as

504
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,720
a lesson as part of the journey. When I

505
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,959
was younger and heard people give the

506
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,639
advice that I'm giving right now, the

507
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,519
takeaway that I would take then was

508
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
okay, so just don't give up like like no

509
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,560
matter what, just kind of like hold on

510
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
to this idea and don't give up, which is

511
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,600
like like I think generally

512
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,519
directionally good advice. But there's

513
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,680
actually like kind of a line where you

514
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,079
have to learn how to be intellectually

515
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,720
honest with yourself and it's like am I

516
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,560
am I not giving up because because

517
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
that's what people say you should do or

518
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,240
am I not giving up because I actually

519
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,040
really like I have conviction in this

520
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,199
and like I just want to see this I I

521
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
really want to see this made possible

522
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,680
and then seeing it all the way through

523
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
right cuz I think when you're when

524
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
you're starting and you're trying to

525
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,839
find that passion in that's kind of one

526
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
challenge and then the other side of is

527
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,199
you know we saw which is okay we built

528
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
this amazing thing Now, how do you

529
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,240
actually turn into a business? The

530
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
important part there is, you know, when

531
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,600
you're driving through hell, don't stop.

532
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,640
If you're going to go and and build a

533
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,720
business, go and try all the way through

534
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,880
and don't leave any stones unturned

535
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,199
because what you don't want then is to

536
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,880
look back and go, "Ah, man, we had this

537
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,799
really cool thing. I think it could have

538
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,880
been really, really important, but we

539
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,880
didn't actually we didn't do a full core

540
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
press and really make sure that we

541
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,679
exhausted all options before, you know,

542
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,679
spinning down or whatever.

543
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,679
AI's impact on software development is

544
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,760
uh I mean huge like I think I think it's

545
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,919
it's clear at this point that software

546
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
development is going to be probably the

547
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,880
number one application of AI that as far

548
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
as like a high leverage uh high impact

549
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,240
high revenue sort of thing. All the

550
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,679
world's software I think is going to be

551
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
meaningfully written by AI in years. I

552
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,320
think I think probably you know

553
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
singledigit sort of years. That doesn't

554
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,039
mean that software developers are going

555
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
away. There's a lot of things in

556
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,720
software development that are just

557
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,880
monotonous and not intellectually

558
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,080
challenging, right? It's just common

559
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
stuff that you're having to do to build

560
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
an application and AI just kind of

561
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
obliterates all that. Can just take care

562
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,960
of all that stuff for you so you can

563
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,799
actually work on like more complicated

564
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,480
high high value intellectually

565
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,679
challenging sort of tasks. And so I

566
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
think we're continue to see more and

567
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,880
more of that, right? We're see more and

568
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
more software built and it's also it's

569
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,559
enabling people to that are not software

570
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,160
developers to actually go and build

571
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
software, right? Whether you have an

572
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,919
idea for a website or an app like you

573
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,880
can go to Bolt today and do that. The

574
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,720
next 5 years of Bolt I think is it's

575
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
it's going to be something that from the

576
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,840
Fortune 100 to 10year-olds people are

577
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,400
building the future of how you you know

578
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,400
stream movies online, how you check your

579
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
bank account using a mobile app to a

580
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,840
game that a 10-year-old had the idea of,

581
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
right? All these things and some of that

582
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,440
stuff you can even do now with Folk,

583
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
right? But the the quality and the scale

584
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,799
of which you're going to be able to do

585
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,640
this stuff is going to be giant, right?

586
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,640
compared to to what you can do now.

587
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Yeah.
