6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,740

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,100
I don't do makeup right yeah but what I

147
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,840
don't get is like makeup routines and

148
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,520
like watching someone else's for advice

149
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,440
because I don't do my own makeup so I

150
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,120
don't get it but like like I feel like

151
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,220
if I watch like some girls like 20

152
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,940
product in-depth makeup thing I'm not

153
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,560
gonna use it it's like the same as

154
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,539
right in the light and then he scurries

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,819
away like it's like you're watching Bob

156
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,080
Ross paint on a canvas but you couldn't

157
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,840
you couldn't do it you couldn't

158
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,180
replicate what I'm saying is like like

159
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,039
like if like if some girl is like a 20

160
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,440
step thing there's no way if you did the

161
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,360
exact same 20 steps like no person would

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,400
look identical is that I guess so

163
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,900
because everybody it's not like guys

164
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,360
basically look like there's it just be

165
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,100

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,300

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,560
and then like last year

182
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,539
that's nice what are you talking about

183
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,220
nine but it's like I remember washing my

184
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,380
face with a bar of soap and I think mom

185
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,120
walked into the bathroom or I don't know

186
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,039
maybe it was a friend that was over but

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,360
they were like don't don't do that like

188
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,039
don't wash your face to the bar soap

189
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,940
it's not good for you but like the way

190
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,460
that

191
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,800
different about this than this

192
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,419
yeah what's the difference why can't I

193
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,819
wash here with a bar soap but I can wash

194
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,800
here you're so correct but also things

195
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,300
what do we also think about like you

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
could go like this so correct you were

197
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,919
like yes look look I'll use this I get

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,300
hair hair's done I'll use this has a

199
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,240
tattoo on it right if I go like this and

200
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,319
I go like that like that bird ain't all

201
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,000
the way over there you know what I mean

202
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
my skin moved because I just like moved

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it you know what I mean like your skin

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
all the way around is in the exact you

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,900
know what I mean whoa hold on do that

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,000
again like if you just pull your skin

207
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,500
like I could go like this right now it

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,660
looks like his arms on like the back

209
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,060
half of my arm but my Skin's just moving

210
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,620
you know what I'm saying so it's like

211
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,060
for your skin your skin on your face

212
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,919
can't be that different from the skin on

213
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,300
like the back of your neck and you're

214
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,860
putting soap and you put soap on your

215
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,319
back you're going like

216
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,880
the back your neck no I kind of cut the

217
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,860
soap off here

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,080
you don't like go behind your head I go

219
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,039
way behind yeah I know I get behind I

220
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,680
guess but do you know what I'm saying or

221
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,140
did I just sound crazy how much money to

222
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,300
get flip-flops right now

223
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,940
toe put cheese in between all of your

224
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,399
toes except for the one that already has

225
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,339
like the flip-flop hole and walk around

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
here for like for like for like two

227
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,580
hours you guys don't understand that

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,680
ratzer is gonna eat whatever Crumbs are

229
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,480
around we don't need cheese to attract

230
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,019
them like it could be how much it's

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,019
classic though

232
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,760
like realistically we're at McDonald's

233
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,160
right so they're getting like a little

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
piece of McDonald's bun or some good

235
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,260
provolone I agree well they don't use

236
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,580
okay okay

237
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,459
the least amount of rats Chris listen

238
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,220
the least amount of rats possible to get

239
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,200
you would you stand over there in a

240
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,540
circle of breadcrumbs or a circle of

241
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,279
American cheese breadcrumbs guaranteed

242
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,760
the bread I feel like I'd be terrified

243
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,160
regardless okay but how much how much

244
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,440
money how much money is how much money

245
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
to walk around and flip-flops right

246
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,339
there I feel like they'd be too scared I

247
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,380
feel like they'd be too scared to do

248
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,820
something about it you think there's no

249
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,279
way a rat would I feel like they're all

250
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,839
like looking

251
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,279
such a dumpster Searcher you see that

252
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,660
they don't team up and like nibble at

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,100
your toes too oh I don't like that

254
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,980
okay we're gonna go back we'll just

255
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,060
absolutely Gob smack a child

256
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,800
the entire show The Masked Singer

257
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,160
like imagine trying to explain to them

258
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,740
like like oh it's they're singing but

259
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,420
it's like when they talk it's like a

260
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,220
manipulated voice and then when if they

261
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,959
do bad and the other singers do better

262
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,080
than them we take their mask off and

263
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,339
it's somewhat of like high Fame and then

264
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,779
and then other people are trying to

265
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,700
guess who it is based off yeah and

266
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,019
there's like a panel that are also just

267
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,060
celebrities I think they think it's way

268
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,160
more serious than it is they'd be

269
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,060
thinking executions the second the mask

270
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,860

would [ __ ] me oh my God like a strip of

313
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,339
light no lights that would just change

314
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,899
like alter a little bit like imagine

315
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,700
those white strip lights and they go

316
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,940

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,560
they're aliens whoa dude yeah like you

318
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,700
switch it and they keep going they're

319
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,320
like

320
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,339
yeah

321
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
listen to color you probably get

322
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,640
beautiful colors that they haven't even

323
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,279
thought about yet then you click the

324
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,260
button but also behind your back to what

325
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,640
I was saying imagine like that they're

326
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,779
sitting down for a family dinner dad

327
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,519
came home with the bread from the

328
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,839
village mom just cooked the meal and

329
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,700

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,920
the brown paper bags like a brown paper

333
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,959
bags

334
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,019
at Wendy's where's the profit mark four

335
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,060
things like that how much are you paying

336
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,980
for I feel like Wendy should also throw

337
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,740
in a dollar to eat they should do a five

338
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,139
for five and give me a a single Benjamin

339
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,200
right is Benjamin 100 he's 100 he's 100

340
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,459
yeah we want Washington like imagine

341
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
like you get like four things and then

342
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:13,320
like a dollar bill what about like an

343
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,660
aluminum sign like a big sign like a big

344
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,760
sign like a big oh my God imagine from

345
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,260
like a Macy's and like the M fell off

346
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,060
the building you gave them like the M

347
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,279
from a Macy's sign they would think it's

348
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,620
like the the [ __ ] Almighty they do

349
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,660
like Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy that's

350
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,000
probably how we feel with like

351
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,620
old [ __ ] hey but I also think if we went

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,420
back there and they had like gave us

353
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,399
like a thing to churn butter I'd have

354
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,680
the same reaction if like I gave them no

355
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,779
I'd be like that's classic That's a

356
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,100
classic

357
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,240
the ability to go into history they

358
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,800
don't have the ability to go in the

359
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,260
future imagine all your memories about

495
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,799
okay why why is it fencing more known I

496
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,940
saw that [ __ ] Wednesday and I was like

497
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,940
damn I need to get a piece of that

498
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:57,539
yeah like it's so like Ugh

00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,720
a sword fight but no harm can we defense

500
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,000
like absolutely I would mess you up all

501
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,860
right let's find out sensing place and

502
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,900
try to do it we should fence in a room

503
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,419
full of fences and make it like a cage

504
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,780
so we're fencing through the fences the

505
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,580
fencing fencers

506
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,020
they fell through seat warmers

507
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,380
oh my God they must have thought they

508
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,380
were on fire

509
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,200
I bet you they did for sweet warmers

510
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,600
back then they probably got like a large

511
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,360
like watering tin they filled it with

512
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,280
wood the watering too not a bucket or

513
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,360
like a pan a watering it filled it with

514
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,039
wood furthermore the watering tips

515
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,720
and then quickly flipped it over that

516
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,280
fire just heated them up I don't think

517
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,679
they just I think they just sat on cold

518
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,500
I don't think they attempted to I agree

519
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,140
warm anything they're like dogs our dogs

520
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,679

524
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,039

00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,400
dogs are new the earliest known dog like

531
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,440
fossils came from Europe but DNA Studies

532
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,080
have implicated East Asia and the Middle

533
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,520
East now a large DNA study is lining up

534
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,179
with the fossils suggesting dogs

535
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,400
originated in Europe 90 000 to 32 000

536
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,440
years ago 19

537
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,860
