46
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,960
there's no intro was just a question

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,640
just [ __ ] do it okay um so I've lived

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,360
in New England my whole life until just

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,399
recently we moved to California like 2

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,920
years ago right yeah I still don't

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,920
understand why we're shoveling snow

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,160
before all of it hits the ground that is

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,680
true you're going to have more to shovel

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,080
in an hour well I don't I don't

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,080
understand no cuz if if it's like oh we

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,640
got 6 to 8 in of snow why shovel two

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,519
sets of three when you can go out and

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,280
shovel 6 in of snow I just think overall

59
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,440
we're doing it too

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
early like I I think that's what he just

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,160
said that's where no I think we need to

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,360
go in the

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,720
middle like I tell us more tell us

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,400
more what Matt's saying is like you keep

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,599
going what is that bever give me a sip

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,040
you want some a pineapple what Matt

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,040
saying is he thinks all the snow should

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,599
fall and then we shovel it can can you

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,480
stop [ __ ] repeating

70
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,599
people like Hello Matt is saying and he

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,920
says what you said we heard Mo on you

72
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,319
have a secondary thought I think right

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,959
when it's in the middle is when we go

74
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,920
out to shovel what's in the middle cuz

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,120
that's what I was just what I said

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,360
should I shake this first like no you

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,599
shouldn't okay

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519

261
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,399
visual yeah I don't care I hate cars I

262
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
think we should take Nick to like a what

263
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
do you feel about like an organized

264
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,440
racetrack though that's pretty cool it's

265
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,800
more fun sure I just don't care you're

266
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,000
moving a you didn't invent the truck

267
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,720
there's people far cool than invent the

268
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,360
truck you didn't invent the [ __ ]

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
mobile if you invented a race car and

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,920
then you race around sure props to you

271
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,639
or if you're a professional you're

272
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,480
actually doing it in sport you're

273
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,800

283
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,399
annoying like whatever at 12:30 at night

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
the ladder is clearly more of an

297
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,240
inconvenience imagine going into a

298
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480

299
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,240

307
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,839
believe it I'd give up my favorite food

308
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,160
I don't believe carry what carry around

309
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,040
a ladder all the time no one said how

310
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,440
tall the ladder had to be it could a

311
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,959
step it could be like a step stools can

312
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,480
double as a little bag like they look

313
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,079
like a don't care no I don't know think

314
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,519
about like working it's like you show up

315
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,720
somewhere you have like a ladder with

316
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,160
you just seems like a lot yeah yeah I'd

317
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,160
rather have a peanut allergy people

318
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,800
can't see the peanut allergy inside but

319
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
they'll always be able to see the ladder

320
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,680
and that's

321
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,000
deep okay okay but what's catching more

322
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,560
bodies the ladder or peanut butter

323
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,040
peanut allergies M I have to say Ladders

324
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,360
because I feel like everybody that has a

325
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,279
peanut allergy they're just getting the

326
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,560
EpiPen nowadays I feel like it's really

327
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:53,079
hard for it to like fully kill you

328
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,240
peanut shockingly only 13 people died to

329
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,480
a peanut allergy last year let's go well

330
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,560
I don't know clapping is still

331
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,360
appropriate yeah that's just not a lot

332
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,160
compared to ladders what is up with

333
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,360
peanuts how many ladders

334
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,560
300 telling you oh I did I get the

335
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,760

the the yeah insane and a itic shock

343
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,199

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,800
this dude do another donut Matt you're

345
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:37,160

346
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,000
it's funny

347
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,839
500 for one for motorcycle crashes for

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,360
motorcycles higher or lower motorcycles

349
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,600
that makes more sense you had it where

350
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,560
it's like we picked underrated word that

351
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,279
sounds exactly like the experience

352
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,240
barf like what like the word barf I know

353
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,560
what you're going to do that's actually

354
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,240
my least favorite word I think it's

355
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
corny I think it's goofy I think there's

356
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,920
so many Alternatives that are way just

357
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
think someone they eat too much candy

358

enough body that the electricity doesn't

505
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,760
kill them if they weren't holding hands

506
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,919
