48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,640
conversation with my mom because like no

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,360

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,680
be the sternol triplets Chris would be

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,400
dead and then no what else I we are

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,160
moving on I refuse to put this much

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,760
attention onto this basically ever since

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,599
we went to the zoo forever ago Matt's

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,200
ankle has been consistant pain and he's

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,400
yet to do something about it so today

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,560
we're taking a group trip as a vlog to

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,480
urgent care and we're going to figure

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,720
out if Matt has been walking on sprained

60
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,280
ankles for about you want to know I've

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,319
been I'm talking to some of my friends

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
that are in med school and such and I've

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,200
been thinking like if you had like a

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,599
broken bone or a sprain or something

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,599
you'd know already and it's been so long

66
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,319
correct and I feel like there would have

67
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,560
to be like severe impact for that to

68
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,280
happen I guess I'm going to guess you

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
have like if you tore something it's

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,120
going to be like a ligament or like a

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,120
muscle or something and that's the

72
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,959
problem awesome

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,159
yeah let's hope you don't have like if

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,920
you had something s like chop your leg

75
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,319
off severe you wouldn't even be able to

76
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,319
stand right now correct I know that

77
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,080

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,360

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,440

minutes cuz I'm done what happened that

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
she said that it could be tendonitis

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,440
whatever the [ __ ] I don't even know what

171
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,800
it means but basically all the tendons

172
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,319
in your leg like your forearm or your

173
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,919
like shin and everything go down towards

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,280
your ankle and like there's a strip of

175
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,120
them right where I am having pain and

176
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,800
she said that I probably need to meet

177
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,199
with an ankle toe Specialist or ankle

178
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,000
