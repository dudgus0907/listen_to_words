[Applause]

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,990
Next up is a business that's making

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:15,160
custom fit products more

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:17,600
[Music]

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,600
accessible. Hi Sharks, my name is

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,160
Matthew from Ventura, California and I'm

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,680
the founder of True Fit Customs. Now we

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
know it's important for sharks to keep

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,920
their teeth in their mouth. Well, it's

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
also important for athletes. It's why

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,239
they wear sports mouthguards. But

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
traditional mouthpieces are big, bulky,

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,200
and uncomfortable. They're the first

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,040
thing left behind on your way to

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,360
practice, and they almost completely

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,520
eliminate in-game communication. How do

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
we expect these boil and bust appliances

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
to fit everyone's unique dental profile?

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,719
And getting a custom fit guard from the

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,559
dentist is expensive and such a hassle.

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
That's why True Fit created a mouthpiece

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
athletes actually want to wear. Each

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,719
guard is made with the latest 3D print

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,120
and scan technology. They feature

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
shockwave dampering compression pads, a

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
sleek, slim profile, and are cut so you

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,200
can breathe and speak as clearly as I'm

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,439
talking to you now. In

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,680
fact, I'm currently wearing one. Nice.

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
It's no coincidence that over 1,000

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,280
professional athletes across the NFL,

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,960
NHL, PLL, NCA, and UFC choose to wear

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,720
True Fit in our game. But we don't just

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
make the best mouthpiece in sports.

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,240
We're on a mission to bring custom fit

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,880
to the people. And that's why we're

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,759
asking for

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,759
$750,000 for 5% of our

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,759
his mouthpiece. Where's my mouthpiece?

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,000
So Sharks, we have some samples for you.

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
Now Matt, when I get my grinder for

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
sleep, they laser my mouth to get a

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
perfect fit. Is that how you're doing

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
these? Cuz how are you going to get

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
custom unless you're getting the exact

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,880
fit for each mouth? It's a great

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
question. So that's why I asked it

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
actually.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
So that impression kit right there is

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
what we use for our direct to consumer

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
model. So this is the gooey stuff you

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,320
stick in your mouth. So what you're

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
going to get at the dentist is an

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,040
algaynet impression putty. What we use

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,680
is silicone putty. It's easier to work

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,319
with, but there's a lot of these. You

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
have a ton of competition. It seems like

58
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,920
a solution to a non-existent problem

59
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,160
since there's so many already in place.

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
Like is there a reason why you think

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,959
there was a lane that wasn't being taken

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,440
by others? We have a great hold on

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,520
digital manufacturing. We specifically

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
know how to scale custom fit

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
fabrication. So when you say digital

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,879
manufacturing robot, are you talking

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,760
about 3D printers or actual robots? The

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,080
whole thing 3D printers to the uh 3D

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,400
scanning to CNC machining. We can

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
manufacture at such a high level because

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
we're almost like an assembly line. When

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
we're fabricating these, we're able to

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,879
do it at such high volumes cuz it's

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,959
machine to machine to machine to

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
machine. All this is great, but you have

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,480
a hefty valuation. And so we want to

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,920
hear about those hefty sales. Yes, sir.

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,519
We started in 2022, we did 115,000. In

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280
2023, we did 750,000.

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
Wow. And then now this year, we're

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
expected to do 1.4 million. That ain't

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,959
worth $15 million. Now you have my

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,959
attention. And how much will you lose?

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
We will make money. Okay. Matt, you

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,599
understand you're asking for close to

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,599
15x sales. This is not realistic at all.

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,200
You know, Mr. Wonderful, I know that you

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
did your dissertation on the dental

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,560
industry. Yes, of course. And you know,

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,879
there's those three big guys in the room

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
that are that own the entire market, but

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
the legal landscape has changed over the

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640
past years and it allowed direct to

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,040
consumer to enter this market, which is

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
taking market share from traditional

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,480
medical practitioners. How much does it

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,319
cost you to make and tell us how much

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
you're selling it for? Our direct to

99
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,760
consumer first-time customer is $95. It

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,640
costs us 31 including shipping. Our CAC

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,360
is $23. We do about a four times return

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,440
on ad spend. And so even with that CAC,

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,720
we have about a 40% margin on our

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,400
first-time customer. Matt, the valuation

105
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,239
is

106
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,480
insane. And it's not even like almost

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
reasonable. So let's negotiate it. I

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,360
just don't see it working to the

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,120
valuation. So for those reasons, I'm

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,200
out. Okay. Listen, when a guy who just

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
put another 3.5 billion in his pocket

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,840
said the valuation's too high, it's

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,040
really too high for me. Meaning Mark. So

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
with that being said, I'm out. Yeah.

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,360
Look, I'm I'm super torn on this because

116
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,079
on one hand, I mentor and I work with

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
over 100 athletes who are not only

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
athletes, but they're investors and they

119
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
like to get into product now. It's this

120
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
new generation of athletes and I'm a

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,520
limited partner in the Atlanta Falcons.

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
So, I'm into the product. Let me ask a

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,199
question. How much have you raised? Uh,

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,360
we've raised a million total. What

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
valuation did they put it in as 7.5

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,600
million? How many units are you going to

127
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
be able to make and ship this year? You

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,759
know, we'd probably look to do 20,000.

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,320
It's not a lot for world domination of

130
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,320
mouthguards.

131
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
How are you going to get millions of

132
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,840
customers outside of the athletes? So,

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
let me explain and win. So, this year we

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
have a team sales model that's really

135
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,880
budding. What we do is we provide guards

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,720
to all these teams. They seed the

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
players. The players love them. Then we

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,040
approach the players for an affiliate

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,320
deal. That's smart program, right? Are

140
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,080
you paying commission? Yeah. Yeah. We

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,479
give them percent of sale. Okay. I love

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,759
your deal. I like you. I'm having a huge

143
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,080
problem like everybody else about your

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,600
valuation. makes no sense at all. So,

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,360
here's an offer for you. I'll do the

146
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,520
$750,000. I'll drop my my equity ass

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
down to 3%. But you're going to pay me

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,240
two bucks a unit until I get back

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
$2,250,000.

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,840
I think that's a bad offer. It's going

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,560
to take me 4 years at your current rate,

152
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,120
but you get Mr. Wonderful. We do one

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,039
thing for you and only one. Get your CAC

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
way down. I got millions of followers. I

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,680
got a massive social media network. say

156
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,400
yes and we fall in love in the denture

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,479
business. Wow. Kevin, I will just tell

158
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
you my thought. You're doing things the

159
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,880
right way, but I think that your

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
valuation is too high. I would want to

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,919
see a lot more proof and it would take

162
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,759
forever to get my money back. I'm sorry.

163
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm out.

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,479
Listen, I'm a venture capitalist and

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
there are two types of investments.

166
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
They're motorcycles and rocket ships.

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,360
So, motorcycles are common and they take

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,919
regular fuel. Rocket ships are rare.

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,280
Very few of them are made and they take

170
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,280
rocket fuel. VCs sell rocket fuel. So,

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,199
I'm looking for rockets. You don't have

172
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,960
the growth rate and the amount of

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,160
revenue as a rocket, but you have the

174
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,160
potential. So, you're trying to take

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
advantage of that. And I know why your

176
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
valuation is 15 million because someone

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
told you that you had to double the post

178
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
money valuation of your previous round

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,280
like every other ventureback company.

180
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,600
So, I get all of that. So, I want to

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,600
make you an offer.

182
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,280
Three sharks are out. Matthew has one

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,919
offer on the table from Kevin for his

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,639
custom mouthguard company, True Fit. But

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,039
Rashan is also interested. Just to give

186
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
you one more summary of it, 750,000 cash

187
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,120
areno. That's a lot of money. Yeah.

188
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah. 3% equity and two bucks a unit

189
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,080
till I get back

190
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,000
2,250,000. That's my deal. First, don't

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,400
do the royalty deal. That's a bad deal.

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,759
I would rather you take There's never a

193
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
bad deal for Mr. Wonderful. less

194
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,440
impossible. I'd rather you take that

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,960
money and reinvest it into growth. I

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,319
don't want you to be profitable at all.

197
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,599
I don't want you increasing your

198
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,039
expenses. I don't want anything coming

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,560
off top cuz I want you to grow that

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,160
revenue and crush all your competitors.

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
That's the venture way, right? So, the

202
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,240
first thing I want to do is I want to

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,880
offer you the

204
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,080
750. I want to bring in 10 to 20

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,759
athletes as brand ambassadors andor

206
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,319
investors. But for that, I want 10% of

207
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,599
the business.

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,880
The greed. The greed. I have never seen

209
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,560
you say no to that. I thought I was

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,840
being generous.

211
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,800
That sounds smart to me. Uh, would you

212
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,240
be interested in doing a million for 8%.

213
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,160
Oh, you're going the wrong direction

214
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,919
here, man. No, you're going the wrong

215
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,520
way. I just offered you things that are

216
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,199
worth more than a million dollars

217
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
because of my track record. I was an

218
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,039
early investor in Coinbase, Robin Hood,

219
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,039
Ring, Casper, Pill Pack, Dropbox. I'm

220
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,400
literally on a winning streak. So, if I

221
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,160
invest in this, this thing is gonna

222
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,479
catch fire and you're gonna raise money

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,800
and you won't have to do anything but

224
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,800
kick ass.

225
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,879
Yeah, I'm sticking to my offer, so I

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,280
need an answer. Okay, so you got two

227
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,039
offers.

228
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Well, we already provide to the Falcons.

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,080
So, Rashan, I'd love to do a deal with

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,879
you. Let's go. All right. All right. All

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,120
right. Excellent.

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, thank you. Welcome to the family.

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
