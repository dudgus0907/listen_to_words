1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
We certainly, you know, had a decent

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,000
early success working with different

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,440
types of investors. A lot of them were

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,719
promising and also big deal at the

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,440
time. And after that, um, then came the

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
crypto winter.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,279
We were watching Bitcoin falling below

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,439
$6,000 overnight and all of those

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,240
alternative coins were down by much

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,240
more. There were just a loss of VC

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,359
interest. uh there were loss of

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
institutional interest and it's about

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,160
minimizing like uh me and like my

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,440
co-founder's cost of living at the time.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
Obviously there were a lot of you know

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
stress there's a lot of uh concerns

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
about what if you know the money runs

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
out tomorrow. So for us you know we had

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
to earn every single user we gained over

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,559
time. We had to earn every single dollar

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,960
that came in. We had to really really

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,520
learn how to be extremely efficient and

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
scrappy with the incubation capital that

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
we were given.

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,120
I think we had a lot of privilege by

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,239
initially going through the 2019 period.

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,200
We had the experience and understanding

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,520
that capital might be very very hard to

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,920
come by for an extended duration of time

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
and that's been basically the mindset

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,000
that we have. Ever since then, that made

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,159
us uh to be conservative during

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,640
very optimistic times and at the same

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,600
time being extremely

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,920
um optimistic during very fearful times.

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,720
The way we did it was focusing on the

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,520
long term. Plan for the future, ignore

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,920
the present conditions. So, if I have a

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,880
time machine and go back and and tell

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,799
myself at that time, it would be cherish

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,079
that moment because you're not going to

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,040
have a lot of those. And it's probably

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
the most powerful feeling in the

44
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,200
world. Hi, I'm Eric Chen, co-founder and

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
CEO of Injective Labs. We built

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
Injective, which is a blockchain built

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
for finance meant to democratize

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
financial access for all. Injective is a

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,479
multi-billion dollar network that's

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
currently delivering more than $50

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,360
billion of exchange volume with more

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,239
than 1.4 million addresses and users as

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,239
well as 1 billion

54
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,640
transactions. I studied uh computer

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
science and uh finance in college. I was

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
in a bit of a soul searching process

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,160
where I didn't really know what I was

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,000
truly good at. I couldn't really find

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,840
something that you know really piqu my

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,599
interest. Everyone doing finance wanted

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
to go into like the banking, hedge

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
funds, private equity, whatever. And

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
everyone like doing computer science

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,440
wanted to go into like Google. For me,

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
it was just uh very very torn. I think

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,879
one of the most interesting part of my

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
college life was certainly learning more

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,480
about crypto and understanding that

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
there's a lot of very interesting like

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,080
research uh subjects. But the first

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,680
thing I did of course was trying to mine

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,920
with the free electricity from the dorm

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
room. What truly made me excite excited

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
at the time was when I was doing

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,440
research on you know a particular issue

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
that was like plaguing the industry

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,200
which was uh front running exchange

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
collision sandwich attacks and stuff

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,120
like that which basically the simplest

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,519
way to understand it is that it makes

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,519
general users or traders lose part of

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,280
their money because some guy can find

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,599
like a better price elsewhere and then

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,280
arbitrage their orders on chain. For us,

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,879
it was basically a very simple

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
understanding is that it's a it's a

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
problem. We can come up with probably

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
like a pretty elegant solution to solve

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
it using some cryptographic trick. I

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,040
think the most interesting part about

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
Injective is that it's very much of a

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
blockchain built for finance. Let's say

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
we were talking about a smart contract

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,280
platform which is like Ethereum, Salana,

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
etc. The way these blockchains operate

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
is that it tries to be web through

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
computer that no matter what you toss at

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
it, it will figure out like a way to

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,040
make it work. The way Injective works is

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,760
that instead of always having to figure

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,159
out ways to optimize for application

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,920
trends or use cases, Injective decides

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,720
to be anchored for financial

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,799
applications. Hi, I'm Albert. Hi, I'm

105
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,480
Eric. We are Injective Protocol. The

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
best and most secure experience for the

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,879
centralized exchange. During the early

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,120
days, in the way the first 100 user that

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
was acquired was actually very simple. I

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
basically went into uh every single

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
group chat that had anything to do with

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,799
uh crypto to reach out to a lot of the

113
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
participants or the vocal members and

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
trying to tell them about hey like use

115
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,159
uh this interactive exchange try it and

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
let us know what you think you know whe

117
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
what whether it makes sense whether it's

118
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,120
a horrible idea and then we should stop

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,359
doing it. I just kept doing it the first

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
50 the first 100 the first god knows how

121
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,000
many hundreds or thousands and I think

122
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
the most interesting part is that

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
there's a lot of very vocal and negative

124
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,199
people in a lot of these like public

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,479
group chats or you know public forums.

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,520
Hey, like why do you have this? It

127
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
doesn't make sense. Why do you have this

128
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
feature? Like no, no one needs it. It's

129
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,560
always very very stressful for you to

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
talk to them or for you to even reach

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
out to them. But if you fight through

132
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,040
that like initial embarrassment

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
interfacing or like dealing with their

134
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
negativity, they end up being a lot more

135
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
valuable of an ally than you can

136
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,639
possibly imagine. A lot of these like

137
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,720
highly critical people are equally

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
critical to everyone and therefore it

139
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
means that they first of all they care

140
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,440
and second of all they give you

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
extremely valuable feedback and third of

142
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,759
all they're a lot nicer than what they

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,440
perceive to be. facing that negativity

144
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,680
with a very positive light and more

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
importantly listening and give everyone

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,880
no matter how negative they are or how

147
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
positive they are time of the day to

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,000
listen to their feedback and implement

149
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
upon it and it's about presenting to

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,919
them with a positive can do attitude

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
addressing every single concern or

152
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,880
problem that they might have listening

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
to every single one of their feedback

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,039
the product around people that voice

155
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,960
their concerns and opinions and really

156
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,960
iterate that way because you don't know

157
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
the right answer especially as a builder

158
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,919
to what's going to happen in the future

159
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,000
with a 100 or a thousand% precision and

160
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,840
accuracy. What you really need is have

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,600
user informed the direction that you're

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,840
building and listening to them because a

163
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
happy user will become the most valuable

164
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,199
ally for no matter what industry you're

165
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
in, no matter what product that you're

166
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,240
building. We certainly, you know, had a

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
decent early success working with

168
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
different types of investors. A lot of

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,080
them were promising and also big deal at

170
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,000
the time. And after that, um, then came

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
the crypto winter. We were watching

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,479
Bitcoin falling below $6,000 overnight.

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,800
And all of those alternative coins were

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,280
down by much more. There were just a

175
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,120
loss of VC interest. There were loss of

176
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,199
institutional interest. We had to

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
really, really learn how to be extremely

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
efficient and scrappy with the

179
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,880
incubation capital that we were given.

180
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
being crammed in a 70 or 80 square ft uh

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
apartment within New York with three

182
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
other roommates moving around in a world

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
trying to source talents at a

184
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,440
cost-effective way and trying to work

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,680
with as many globalized you know

186
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
developers and users and trying to

187
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
figure out ways to you know make

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
everything work. I think we had a lot of

189
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,160
privilege by initially going through the

190
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,199
period where we had the experience and

191
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,120
understanding that capital might be very

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,680
very hard to come by for an extended

193
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,080
duration of time that basically made us

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
to be conservative during optimistic

195
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,360
times and at the same time being

196
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,759
extremely optimistic during very fearful

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,680
times. It allows us to basically no

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,680
matter what condition it is always

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,440
ensure that you know we have a certain

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,520
amount of runway and we always can

201
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,840
survive for more than 5 years. The way

202
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,639
we did it was focusing on the long term

203
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,599
plan for the future ignore the present

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,720
conditions. Being around enough cycles

205
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,120
helps a lot because during extremely

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
bullish times uh during extremely

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,440
optimistic times we slowly become more

208
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
and more jaded more and more fearful. we

209
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,000
have like a innate sense of uh it's

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
almost like a primal instinct that

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
something is about to go wrong and I

212
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
think this helped a lot because it's

213
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
basically like an instinct that was like

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
developed over time after being in so

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
many cycles even before an injective on

216
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
another hand it's just like aial

217
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
question like have you earned it? uh a

218
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,560
lot of times you know like the success

219
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,360
is asymmetrical to the output and to the

220
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
fundamentals and oftent times we at all

221
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
times question ourselves whether we have

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
like earned the success that we have we

223
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,199
are often very very critical so we

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
always doubt that we did earn it and I

225
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
think that's still a very strong

226
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,960
relative benchmark to see how long-term

227
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
you

228
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,479
are I think the most exciting thing

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,400
about uh injective especially at the

230
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,560
current stage is about decentralizing

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
the access to finance to everyone.

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Finance is truly a game for the rich and

233
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,039
it really shouldn't be. Whether you have

234
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
just $1 or like $5, you get to have

235
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,560
access to the same type of opportunity

236
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,639
to those with uh, you know, $5 million

237
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
or $10 million. And this is completely

238
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
not the current financial world.

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Basically, if you want opportunity,

240
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
especially high growth, it's just layers

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,680
and layers of like investment advisors,

242
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
brokers, and stuff like that to purchase

243
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,640
one share of Apple, you have to have,

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,680
you know, hundreds and hundreds of

245
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,360
dollars. There's not even a

246
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
fractionalized concept within the stock

247
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,880
market. For us right now, the most

248
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
exciting thing is about being able to

249
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,160
bring in real world assets, being able

250
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,440
to tokenize so many exciting

251
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
opportunities happening in the

252
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,880
cross-section of traditional financial

253
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,800
world and also the crypto world. This

254
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
has just been always a dream of us, even

255
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
during the early days of Injective,

256
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,880
which is being able to access a lot of

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,000
these traditional products like Tesla or

258
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,760
GameStop, creating it in a platform that

259
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
also has access to different types of

260
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
crypto primitives while at the same time

261
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,000
being able to access it from all over

262
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,640
the world, from Argentina to Europe to

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
Asia and everywhere in the same easy to

264
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
access, easy to use platform. Basically

265
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,240
making uh financial products and assets

266
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,240
more accessible than ever.

267
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,920
I don't think there's going to be a lot

268
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,760
of uh material change uh for people in

269
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
the world. Their day doesn't just

270
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,480
suddenly become completely different at

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,800
full 180. But I think it's really about

272
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,640
the subtlety of things. Maybe you just

273
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,959
have more savings in your bank. Maybe

274
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,519
you can connect with your friends 20,000

275
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,120
miles across the world a lot easier.

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,040
Everyone is just a little bit better off

277
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,320
because of the opportunities that was

278
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,200
now accessible to you. I remember I uh

279
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,120
came up with Injective at the stolen

280
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
co-working space from my friend. It

281
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,680
wasn't something too flashy. It was just

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
hey this could be a solution to

283
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,240
something at that time. It was a very

284
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,800
very rare feeling to have the space

285
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
especially at a time was just

286
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,320
ostentatious way too much grandiose like

287
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,160
visions and stuff like that. So oftent

288
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
times it felt like it was losing touch

289
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,760
with reality. So that was a very rare

290
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
feeling for me even though these days I

291
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,240
get more and more of these feelings. uh

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
uh at this point in time. It was very

293
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,040
very rare at the time. So if I have a

294
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,000
time machine and go back and and tell

295
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,839
myself at that time, it would be cherish

296
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,120
that moment because you're not going to

297
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:39,480
have a lot of those. And it's probably

298
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,480
the most powerful feeling in the world.
