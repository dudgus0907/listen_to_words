1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
Uh I think the trade-off if anything for

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,520
sure would be you know what one goes

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
through in college. I I felt I learned

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,880
equally if not more uh in terms of what

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,800
I wanted to acquire. Exposure to a fast

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,599
growing startup looking at how a venture

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,600
builder a VC thinks. I think having a

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,760
huge amount of ambition and a good

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
amount of naivity is what helps

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,320
entrepreneurs get started and having

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,960
that dreamer within you helps you do

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,039
things that are bolder one would not

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
conventionally take as well. Hi, I'm

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
Gdoric Chu, the co-founder and CEO of

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,719
Intellect. We are a mental health care

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
company serving and building for

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,640
Asia-Pacific and eventually the world.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
We provide end-to-end mental health

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,040
support from proactive care all the way

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
towards coaching, clinical, and distress

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,120
support. We've raised funding from the

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,440
likes of Tiger Global, White Combinator,

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
Insignia. To date, we've raised over $30

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
million in funding. Well poised to grow

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,079
and scale in the next uh many years to

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,079
come as well.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,720
I would say growing up I always had an

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,000
inkling that I wanted to be an

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
entrepreneur. My parents aren't

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,439
entrepreneurs themselves but I always

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,880
been quite inspired by people who have

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,400
built things that they believe in

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
themselves. I studied in Raffles

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
institution. It's uh I would say the

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
leading secondary high school in

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,560
Singapore where many of our greatest

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
Singaporeans have been to. I got in from

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
the benefit of a great educating system

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
and having worked hard to get there as

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,040
well. But as I went through my my years

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,280
studying, what I found out uh for myself

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,439
was that I had a clear want to to build

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,400
to do things and not necessarily go

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,920
through the career path that most of us

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
set out to do. But I was quite clear

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
that I wanted to build. I want to do

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,200
something that actually I care about

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
that I believed in and hence why I

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
decided against pursuing you know going

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,479
to to university or college and rather

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,479
chose to uh learn by doing learn by

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,119
joining companies that are have been

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,439
that and learn by doing myself as well.

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,439
First company I started back then was uh

55
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
a digital media platform right where we

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,840
actually gathered thought leaders

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
experts CEOs doctors to contribute

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
thought leadership pieces expert

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,280
articles to help people learn and grow.

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,959
At the point itself, I I was huge on

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
personal growth. You know, think of your

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
Tony Robbins, the like that actually

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
helps you grow and and develop who you

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
are. I was huge on this back then in my

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
in my later teenage years and believe

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,239
that many others would benefit from

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,000
consuming such pieces of information as

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,480
well versus just you know etiquette or

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,480
your fun quiz type stuff as well. That

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,200
company back then I would say was very

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,680
very lean. It was entirely bootstrapped.

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,400
We we had a whole network of anything

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
from volunteers to part- timerrs to to

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
guest writers that all contributed to

75
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,120
build that network of what we had. In

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,640
the end, I ran the first company for

77
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,920
about two plus years. At the point in

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,440
time, the biggest challenge was I really

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,200
didn't know what I was doing at a point

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,200
very candidly. I didn't even call it a

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
startup. It was a a website platform

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,680
that I was kind of doing. One of the

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
core things I would say I I believe in

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,319
it simply doing right. I do believe that

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
one does not have and would not have all

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,879
of the knowledge and all the skill sets

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,120
at any point of time. you can be more

88
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,120
experienced but sitting by doing and

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,159
trying uh one gets there. The challenges

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,560
was the fact that I didn't really know

91
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,400
what I was going about doing. What I

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,159
took was very logical steps on you know

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,760
finding the right people to work with

94
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,200
the right content to create the right

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,480
audience that we wanted to reach and

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
then things followed through from there

97
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
as

98
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,920
well. After exiting my first company

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
then I actually spent a few years

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
working for other very exciting firms. I

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
spent time at startups. I spent time at

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,720
venture builders. the the high level

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,720
intent then was I was quite aware that I

104
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,920
was a very young individual right I was

105
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,920
about 19 20 or so and I had very little

106
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,599
skill sets I had gotten lucky to have

107
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,440
done something interesting I didn't have

108
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
the experience nor the skills to

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
actually build something at a large

110
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,599
scale if I really wanted to so I decided

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,840
to spend time to go and endeavor and

112
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,440
find startups that were growing faster I

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
could learn from that excited me and and

114
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,959
that's what I did so following the years

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,519
that I had uh you know doing my first

116
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,439
company uh I joined a a a Japanese

117
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,360
travel tech startup called Voyagen that

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
actually I led a component of their

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
marketing team as well. The company got

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
acquired by Rocket which is a huge

121
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,799
Japanese conglomerate. So that was a

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,319
very eye opening as well right what

123
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,000
actually happened next after you know

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,000
that have I actually moved towards a

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
venture builder sort of a VC venture

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,239
builder firm called that was the next

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
chapter of my own journey as well I

128
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,080
wouldn't say there was uh particularly

129
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,080
regret or remorse you know going through

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
trade journey I was very intentional

131
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,759
about the choices I made and what I

132
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
wanted to pursue and the way I looked at

133
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,720
it was there were trade-offs in both

134
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,000
paths right I do strongly believe in a

135
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
good education country with a strong

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
education system so I think it's

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,160
fantastic that folks who go to path have

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,840
their own journey there as well. Uh I

139
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
think the trade-off if anything for sure

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,280
would be you know what one goes through

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,320
in college the experience and exposures

142
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,000
that go with the college experience. At

143
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,960
the same time I would say for myself I I

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,960
felt I learned equally if not more uh in

145
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,960
terms of what I wanted to acquire

146
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
exposure to a fast growing startup

147
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,600
looking at how a venture builder a VC

148
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
thinks and actually doing right learning

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
from actually practicing and doing on

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
the job as I built my own experiences as

151
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,039
well. You know after existing my first

152
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,160
company it was quite clear to me that I

153
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,080
was going to build something that could

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
reach and help and impact more people as

155
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
well. Uh on a personal level mental

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
health has always been a very personal

157
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,639
journey. So something that I went

158
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
through in high school in secondary

159
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
school was actually quite chronic

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
ongoing anxiety. I struggled with

161
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
anxiety in my teenage years and I

162
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
actually started having panic attacks

163
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
when I was 16. That's when I started to

164
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,080
see a therapist. So and what I remember

165
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,080
quite clearly was my very first therapy

166
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,560
session was one of the most cathartic

167
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,479
experiences I had. If people knew how

168
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
helpful therapy was, everybody would be

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,479
actually doing it. There was a national

170
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
survey actually done pre- pandemic in

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,240
Singapore. One of the key stats that

172
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,560
stand out quite scarily to me is that

173
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,320
there is a 4 to 7year treatment gap of

174
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,759
mental health support and care. That

175
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,759
means to say if someone's actually

176
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
mentally unwell and needing care, they

177
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,440
waited 4 to 7 years before they got that

178
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,720
care. And that's for those that actually

179
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,199
eventually got the care, which is a

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
scary long and and and delayed period of

181
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
time if you think about it from a

182
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
physical health point of view. So it's a

183
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,800
huge huge issue and and if you look at

184
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
it from a outcomes perspective as well.

185
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
Asia many of the fastmoving cities have

186
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
some of the highest suicide rates as

187
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
well. So the problem is extremely clear

188
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
and extremely real. I mean from a from a

189
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
top down perspective the mental health

190
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,800
market across the world and even Asia is

191
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,280
in the tens of billions of dollars. We

192
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,280
believe this market not from our belief

193
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,280
but it is growing annually in double

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
digit percentage rates as well. So fast

195
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,360
forward years later into 2019, mental

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,880
health was something that I I was quite

197
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
clear was one of the key things I wanted

198
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,680
to to tackle and solve for. And having

199
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
gone through many more lived

200
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
experiences, uh having seen peers,

201
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
friends and friends of friends gone

202
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,800
through much much more troubling and

203
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
darker things themselves, a very clear

204
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
thing popped up was how do we actually

205
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
change this? How do you make mental

206
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,759
health care accessible as well as

207
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,560
everyday no matter how big or how small

208
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,440
your issues may be? In the earliest days

209
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,759
of intellect I in a very very lean setup

210
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,440
we we actually went about to understand

211
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
mental health what is the problem around

212
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
mental what was the thing that needed to

213
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,440
be solved for as well and we came to a

214
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,080
very very simple problem statement

215
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,759
people in Asia need help they want help

216
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,440
but they don't know where to start so

217
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
our initial hypothesis is how do we

218
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
bring care to them in a way that it's

219
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
almost extremely uh too simple like

220
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,440
there there's no reason why one couldn't

221
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,599
access care that was a simple initial

222
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,680
hypothesis bringing access to everyone

223
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,199
first scaling access and then secondly

224
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
getting deeper and deeper in the care

225
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,360
that we bring as well and hence why and

226
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
like what we do spans across different

227
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
mediums there is self-guided content

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
that is anytime anywhere different

229
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,520
languages we have deeper live virtual

230
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
care we even have crisis support as well

231
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,080
and we've gone in that journey from

232
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,240
scaled up care towards deep immersive

233
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
facetoface support as well firstly

234
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,919
anyone starting at a company is hard no

235
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,080
matter how I believe how experienced or

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,520
how inexperienced one is there are so

237
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,840
many uncertainties, so many variables

238
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,599
that never guarantees anyone's puff. For

239
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
us in particular, mental health, you

240
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,560
know, when we started the company back

241
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,560
in 2019, it was a very very nent topic

242
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
particularly so in Asia. Most clients,

243
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,080
bias, investors were not seeing this as

244
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
a priority for them at a point in time

245
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,479
as so for us it was really stemming from

246
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
a strong conviction, a belief that

247
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,840
mental health was not an if but a when.

248
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,520
Mental health is as important as

249
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
physical health. In many ways, even more

250
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,759
important sometimes because of how it

251
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,360
affects all that we do as well. So for

252
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
us the challenge then was how do we

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,720
build the cali? How do we build the

254
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,319
market? It was a nent space. How could

255
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,120
we actually convince our first

256
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,360
investors, users, customers? It was hard

257
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,440
to convince people to actually meet you

258
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
firstly or even you know want to do a

259
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
pilot and trial review rather as well.

260
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
So much less finding customers for us.

261
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
The early days were really speaking with

262
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,120
a lot of individuals anyone from HR

263
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
professionals, clinicians, folks on the

264
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
streets even as well to try and very

265
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,480
clearly understand what was the problem

266
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,480
we're trying to solve for. the first 10

267
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
customers a small small pool of people

268
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
to validate and these were early stage

269
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,399
startup that were happy to actually test

270
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
out and let us know if it worked or not.

271
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
So I would say what worked out well for

272
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
us was actually starting small knowing

273
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,760
quite clearly the broader vision and

274
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,279
mission was but starting in smaller

275
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,640
steps that we could chip away towards

276
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
that larger goal eventually as

277
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,959
well. It's been quite a journey. It's

278
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,320
been it's been not been uh relative

279
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,399
towards the bigger scheme of things not

280
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,399
been a huge amount of time but a time

281
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
that a lot has happened at least in in

282
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,800
my life. So I'll say one of the biggest

283
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,800
learnings I've had that that I find

284
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,399
useful and I I keep reminding myself

285
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,200
time and again is that it helps to have

286
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,279
a bit of naive in terms of what one one

287
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
has right in terms of what I think is my

288
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,560
my superpower if I could say it's huge

289
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
ambitiousness in terms of what I believe

290
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
one can actually achieve and that has

291
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
actually for better or for worse guided

292
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
me into taking the steps I have taken

293
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,360
from you know not going to pursue higher

294
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
education starting a startup and and

295
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,120
doing what we have today as well. I

296
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,600
think having a huge amount of ambition

297
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,839
and a good amount of naivity is what

298
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,800
helps entrepreneurs get started and

299
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,160
having that dreamer within you helps you

300
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,480
do things that are bolder that one would

301
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
not conventionally take as well. So I

302
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,240
would say in terms of what my advice is

303
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
for people aspiring to be entrepreneurs

304
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,080
young or old as well definitely possible

305
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760
right I'll encourage those who are

306
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,760
interested to try to definitely give it

307
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
a shot. I I I do fundamentally believe

308
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,440
that there is no better time in our

309
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
history for one to actually start a

310
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,000
company to have the amount of access to

311
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,600
information and reach of audiences than

312
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
than ever before with the internet and

313
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,880
with with all that's happening.

314
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,959
Definitely try but definitely expect

315
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
that outcomes may differ from people to

316
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,160
people. I don't I don't think that

317
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
everyone is born or meant to be an

318
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,839
entrepreneur but I think everyone

319
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,079
definitely can try cuz if anything one

320
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,320
learns massively from this experience in

321
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,040
many cases one can actually impact a lot

322
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
more people as well. So I do believe

323
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,880
fundamentally there's many paths towards

324
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,399
one defines as fulfillment or or even

325
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,920
success as well. And this is the path

326
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,519
that I've taken but there will be many

327
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,270
more that people can actually take on to

328
00:10:51,519 --> 00:11:01,970
to achieve what they want to do as well.
