1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,380
Next into the tank is a solution to an

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,559
age-old problem.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,559
[Music]

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,240
Hi Sharks. I'm William Mias. I'm Michael

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,000
Curry. And I'm Tony La Hood. We're from

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,080
Cleveland, Ohio. And we're the founders

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
of Sauce Moto. Today we're here to offer

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,400
you a 15% stake in our company for

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
$45,000.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
Since the advent of the drive-thru,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we've all been faced with a horrible

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719
decision when eating in our cars. What's

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,879
that, Mike? Risk fumbling, making a mess

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,800
with your dipping sauce, or heaven

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,800
forbid, having to eat a ketchupless fry.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
That's disgusting. And we could not

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
stand for this any longer. That's why we

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,840
took fate into our own hands and molded

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
from the clay of the earth the Saus Moto

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,000
dip clip. A condiment holder designed

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,719
specifically for your car. Sauce Moto

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,600
isn't just a cup holder for your sauce.

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,240
No, it's a purveyor of freedom. It's

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,960
universal clip attaches to just about

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,600
any vehicle's air vent. And its unique

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,960
5in-1 aperture holds sauce from just

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,759
about all fast food restaurants. Bravo.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,400
Bravo. Oh. Through extensive field

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,799
testing and countless nights of grueling

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,720
fast food research, we developed Sausoto

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,040
to hold up to just about any road

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
condition. Sharks, don't try this at

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
home. You want to go for a ride? Yes,

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,159
I'm starving. Let's say you're enjoying

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,200
your nuggets when the driver suddenly

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,759
turns onto a cobblestone path. Oh, and

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,320
suddenly a strong gust of wind comes

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,759
from the east. It's hardly ideal dipping

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,759
conditions, but not with Sauce

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,079
Moto. That's right. Any sauce, any

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,880
climate, Sauce Moto has your nuggets

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,439
covered. Together, we can make the

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,159
ketchupless fry a thing of the past.

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,920
It's time to practice safe sauce. So,

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
Sharks, who wants to dip into this

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
investment and make sure no one has to

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,360
endure a sauceless nugget again.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,599
Who's hungry? Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,239
And a bent, too. Yes. Oh, thank you.

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,920
More food. Just what I need. See that?

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
These nuggets are great. Yeah, these

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,000
nuggets are really great. So, how did

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,920
you come up with this? About 10 years

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,160
ago, we were on a road trip, got hungry,

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,680
decided to get some nuggets and fries,

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
and the inevitable happened, and I

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
spilled some sauce in Tony's brand new

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
car, and that's when we just started

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
brainstorming. Okay, how how could we

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,040
keep them secure? Uh, you know, in the

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,519
car. You really thought this was a big

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,239
problem? It really is. It really is a

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,440
problem. It is catch. How many of these

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,599
have you sold? Uh, we've done 12,000

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,200
units for about $77,000 in sales. Wow.

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm just curious. Are you excited to be

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
here? I'm not sure I'm feeling any

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,319
pulse. No, I really am excited to be

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,680
here. I mean, I we work really hard on

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,680
this. This is Tony's natural voice.

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,319
What is your role in this business? Each

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,239
of our roles. Okay. So, yeah, I'm the

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
engineer. I designed most of it here.

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
Um, testing and your design, your

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,800
marketing. Uh Tony and I well I kind of

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
span between both. I'll I'll from from

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
design and creative. Uh I'll do any the

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,800
graphic design. We do everything in

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,879
house. Most of the product testing too,

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
right? And who? Oh yeah. And who

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,280
designed this package? I did. Fabulous

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,760
design. It tells you everything you want

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
to see. Doesn't take up any space. I

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,720
even want to have one. I don't even eat

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
fast food. That's the reaction we

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
usually get is when people see it,

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
they're just like take my money. So what

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
does it cost? What did you sell them

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,799
for? We're selling them for about 5.75

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,440
on, you know, our website and online. Uh

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,280
it cost us about 80 cents to make.

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
What's your background? I'm a sales

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
engineer in the tire industry. I'm a

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
mechanical engineer doing product

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,480
development for a wood tool company. I I

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,239
own a couple of bars. Oh, you do? Good

97
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
for you. In Cleveland? Yeah, I've

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
probably been there. My people are going

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,480
to find you. We knew that nugget culture

100
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,720
is actually really real. Nugget culture.

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,360
Absolutely. We built this for verality.

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,480
We did the amazing videos and those just

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,080
went viral. We had 44 million

104
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,159
views over Facebook. Do you guys really

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
expect to sell like millions of these?

106
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,920
Stanford study concluded that there's

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
20% of American meals are actually

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,799
consumed in automobiles. Wow. I eat

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
probably 30% of mine. And there's a lot

110
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,800
of Yeah, there's a lot of people who

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,880
just don't have time like to go home and

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
sit down and have a lunch. So, one of

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
the biggest things that we've realized

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,520
with Sausoto is it's an extremely good

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,680
promotional tool for companies. So, if

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
we approached a fast food chain, rental

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,360
car companies, um we were actually in

118
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,000
talks with two major sauce manufacturers

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
right now um for promotional product. I

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
think you guys are taking this the wrong

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,759
direction. It's not nuggets. It's all

122
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,440
about the fries. Everybody eats fries. I

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,680
like the deal cuz I can see taking it

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,040
public on the NYC. You'll be ringing the

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,880
bell with me. I think this is huge. But

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
wait a sec. Maybe there's a smoking hot

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,440
offer coming here. I do see the use of

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,000
it. I mean, I eat fries in the car and I

129
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,919
like to dip my fries and it's an issue.

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
But you know, I've got to wet my beak. I

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,600
got to wet my beak. You want a lot of

132
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,880
money here. This is $45,000. We're not

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,039
messing around. 15%. This imputes a

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
crazy valuation. You know that. But I'm

135
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,560
willing to go, but I want a little bit

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,840
more equity. I'll do it for 50%. Oh,

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
thank you, Kevin. Thank you. Appreciate

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,680
that offer. You want to be at the drive

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,080
up window and they say, "Look, for an

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
extra whatever, you can get the sauce

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
moto. This is really cool." You clip

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
your sauce into it. That's where you

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,000
want to be. That's complicated deal.

144
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
That's a complicated deal to cut. They

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
give it away as a promotion. Thank

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,840
goodness you went cuz that's the kind of

147
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,080
deal I like to take on as a challenge.

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,000
Look, I think it's a great product, but

149
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
like you've already found out, you're

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
going to have to hustle for big sales

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
across, you know, promotional

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
opportunities.

153
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,680
that that's just a lot of time and it

154
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,199
just doesn't get me all sauced up. And

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,759
so for those reasons, I'm out.

156
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,919
It's such a little product. It's such a

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
small price. Don't let these sharks drop

158
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,440
out. No. No. And this my price is going

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
way up. If these guys drop out, shut up

160
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
a minute. It's going way up to the door.

161
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Three grown men sharing the potential

162
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,960
profit of this tiny little product. This

163
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,360
isn't my kind of business. I'm sorry.

164
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm out.

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,639
I have one final question. Who created

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,360
the videos that saw 44 million hits? We

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,440
wrote the scripts and we hired a crew to

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
film them. How much did it cost you to

169
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,840
make however many videos you made for 44

170
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,280
million views? $4,000. $4,000. Wow. You

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,759
got to be kidding me. We

172
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,720
$4,000. You are in the wrong business.

173
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,560
Am I getting all the products you guys

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,080
create going forward? Going forward.

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,160
Absolutely. Yes. I get the dream team.

176
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, of course you'd complete the dream

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
team. Okay, guys, I'm going to help you

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,120
out here, okay? Cuz that's the kind of

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,080
guy I am. I'll give you 45,000 for

180
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,639
40%. I got to tell you, it's the team.

181
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I love

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
the three of you. You guys are an

183
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,120
ability to create the videos and the

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,759
marketing. I actually think there's a

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,479
great product within you. This may or

186
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,240
may not be it, but I'll go along for the

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440
ride.

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
So, I'll tell you what I'm willing to

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
do. You basically got a third, a third,

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,039
a third. If I come in as a partner, a

191
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,680
very important one that's willing to

192
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,199
work hard on this, I'll do it if I get

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
25% so that we're all

194
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,479
equal. Stop thinking about it because

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
the clock is ticking and I want you out

196
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
of here with me as well. You actually

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
would not be a bad partner for you. And

198
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,840
you knew you would get you were going to

199
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,840
have to give up 25%. Yes or no?

200
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,599

202
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,800
world with this, guys. Thank you, man.

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
Hug it out. Hug it out. We're talking

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,520

205
