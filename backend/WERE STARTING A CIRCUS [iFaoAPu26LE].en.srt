I said I don't know what world you're

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,799

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,480
alternate universes so we're going to

106
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,920

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,920
[ __ ] living in oh my God I'm the best

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,919
in this topic we don't have any like set

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,759
plans of discussion I just want to know

110
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,600
like in an alternate universe do you

111
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,000
think like I think there's endless

112
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,919
possibilities and that's why I picked

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,560
this topic today because what we're in

114
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,560
this universe this is all we know this

115
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,199
matter this fiber this being this is who

116
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,160

117
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,240

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,199
like we should all decide that match at

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,960

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,400

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,840
the way you did it like get off me an

128
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,840
ocean breeze so sorry oh and my breast

129
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,560
stinks I think what is this

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,560
for there's two options

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,600
oh

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
guys me and Nick watched the worst movie

133
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,919
ever tonight that's not the topic yeah

134
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
let's carry on to the actual topic

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,400
there's probably an alternate universe

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,479
out there where me and you left the

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,360
movies tonight skipping on our feet with

138
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,080
excitement of how much how good it was

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
no that's not true is that not crazy cuz

140
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,160
I think of alternate universe people are

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
like oh alternate universe what if

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
there's like an alien version of me and

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,240
he's like he can speak like a million

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
different languages and [ __ ] I just want

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,840
to know if we are living this exact

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,759
moment but like blue just a quarter of a

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,720
universe over and I know we talk about

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,199
this before so I know people are going

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,000
to be like do you get deja vu this is

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
the year of progression this is the year

151
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,440
of moving forward we are in an alternate

152
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,880
universe we are in this universe do you

153
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,479
think there's an alternate universe

154
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,759
right over where they're like oh my god

155
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,160
do you think there's an alternate

156
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,720
universe and yeah there is cuz we're in

157
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,440
it cuz that's the thing they're saying

158
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,600
oh aliens don't exist because there are

159
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,680
no planets out there with what like

160
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,240
humans need to survive who the [ __ ] said

161
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,000
there isn't like alien slug magma who

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,199
said There who who's to say there's not

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,400
like a magma slug on on Mercury right

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,039
now oh there's no their heat conditions

165
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,599
there aren't suitable for life for you

166
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,280
Mr President but what about the magma

167
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,759
slug Nick do you know what I mean though

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,520
who's to say you in your human shell

169
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
that there's not a magma slug planet

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,400
that just be in our universe though but

171
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
in one on one of our planets oh yeah I

172
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,440
was getting a little sidetracked when

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,440
people are thinking oh there's alternate

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,479
universes right and like what am I doing

175
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,759
in an alternate universe they're

176
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,160
thinking of an

177
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,680
obscure human activity that they cannot

178
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,080
do they're like what if there's me but

179
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,319
I'm purple and I'm like really good at

180
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,680
painting cuz I'm not purple and I can't

181
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:48,039
paint who's to say they're not playing

182
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,960
like an alien game that we can't even

183
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,319
imagine because we're not there cuz

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,880
people are like oh in an alternate

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,560
universe I'm probably like the best

186
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,639
fortnite player ever in an alternate

187
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,240
universe I'm probably so good at

188
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
painting in an alternate universe I'm

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,120
probably so good at cooking in all these

190
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
alternate universes people are probably

191
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,560
saying oh what if this happened this

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,800
happened this happened how about they're

193
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,280
probably playing alien version of

194
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,000
connect for croquet in a [ __ ] magma

195
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,360
field walking on magma Rock You Love

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,520
magma great word you think there's alien

197
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,160
Elderly Homes where they're just sitting

198
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,120
around [ __ ] watching movies together

199
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,199
as the elderly and drawing playing bingo

200
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,840
no they're playing tackle football

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,840
correct no not even they're playing God

202
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,759
knows what not even if we can IM more

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,160
int if we can imagine it it can't be

204
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,080
happening there could be anything else

205
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,319
we just can't even say our imagination

206
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,960
is Limitless what if our imagination

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,280
true what if our imagination is limited

208
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,520
think of the wildest thing you can think

209
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,759
of Matt tell me um an animal with wings

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
something elephant that can fly that

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,039
lives in Antarctica an elephant that can

212
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,840
fly that lives in Antarctica you just

213
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,199
thought of that so we can all

214
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,639
collectively us three and the viewer we

215
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,400
can all was that the first

216
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,759
time the fourth wall directly us three

217
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,560
and the viewer can imagine an elephant

218
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,360
so to speak flying in speak right cuz

219
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,879
you said it what if and I I could

220
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,039
contradict your thought oh what if it's

221
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,199
a cheetah flying in the desert it' be

222
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,840
like oh what if it's not that what if

223
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,280
it's this but if the fact that we can

224
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,319
speak it we can't even imagine the

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,639
things that could possibly be going on

226
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,800
yeah anything I say could be wrong cuz I

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
can think of it okay what if there's

228
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,719
something that they're doing that I just

229
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,640
can't even think of they could be it

230
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,120
could be a blood bath in a nursery home

231
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,640
and the last one standing get

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,880
resurrected back to life but also you

233
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,360
just imagine that see my point yeah

234
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,040
today when the guy changed our tire he

235
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,959
goes you want to hear a terrible joke he

236
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,360
said no I just remembered right now he

237
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,360
was like give you a dut for the trip

238
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
home do you remember when someone gave

239
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,320
me a free donut after accusing me of

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,120
stealing an apple juice yes what pisses

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,399
me off is when they got the car wash guy

242
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,240
with a spinning the arrow outside or

243
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,399
like dressed up as a little character

244
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,800
like a tire dressed up like a character

245
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,959
yeah like a hamburger come eat our

246
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,079
hamburgers no I want the person behind

247
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,240
the counter dressed up as what I'm going

248
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,560
to eat how happy would you be if you

249
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,160
went into like Dunkin Donuts so to speak

250
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,800
and a donut took your order how about

251
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,519
let's use AI for good use instead of AI

252
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,720
this AI that let's get AI donut hash

253
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
years to take my order of Dunkin Donuts

254
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,160
how thrilled are you I want a strawberry

255
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,440
frosted donut the strawberry frosted

256
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,240
donut replies coming right

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,640
up that's it and then you get your

258
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,120
strawberry frosted I feel like it would

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,480
be more thing like he'd kind of be like

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,680
I think he'd flirt with you if you order

261
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,200
exactly what he is oh my gosh true yeah

262
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,519
like I want a strawberry frosted donut

263
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,399
he'd be like like he kind of size you up

264
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,240
you want give me 3 hours I'm off of work

265
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:01,200
in a bit oh my God I don't get like the

266
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,839
whole like FL flag Arrow spinning cuz

267
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,920
it's like where am I going correct down

268
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
up flying upside down correct you're

269
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,360
just may those are the parallels to the

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,320
alternate universes you don't know where

271
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,000
to go we're pointing at universes I feel

272
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,839
like I just cracked the [ __ ] code I

273
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,480
think they spin it around and it just

274
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,760
aims continuously at the place and like

275
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,600
majority this way cuz it would just look

276
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,040
ridiculous it would look ridiculous if

277
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,040
they just kept like pointing it to the

278
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,240
left or like sh it you know what I mean

279
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,839
they got to give it a twirl they don't

280
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,320
they could just put it on a post and

281
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,000
leave no cuz the whole entertainment is

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,959
there like a ton of movement just to

283
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,360
make the sign more like whoa there's

284
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,560
something going on no put they need to

285
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,560
put this like bop it shake it spin it

286
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,120
twist it go in there go order a burger

287
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,160
imagine if there's a guy standing right

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,399
next to a sign that says car wash this

289
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,839
way and he holds like a Smoke N throws

290
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,399
it at his feet smoke and then he's gone

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,200
that would be

292
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,320
very that would be false

293
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,320
advertisement how how are you going to

294
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,560
get to the car wash no it's just an

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,000
arrow like it's not advertising that

296
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,360
you're CU if I see someone disappear via

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,680

motorized vehicle hello I want to

299
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,680
teleport do you think in the alternate

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,120
universe there's like the stern

301
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,600
quadruplets no I can't believe like

302
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,160

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
