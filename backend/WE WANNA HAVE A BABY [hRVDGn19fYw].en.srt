00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,120
when I was like maybe like eight or nine

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,520

151
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,199
like oh I hope that like no one in the

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,199

everything 10 times scarier cuz simply

196
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,199
that guy driving by right there just

197
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,479
like freaked me

198
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,720
out you're a psychopath that's this is

199
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,840
why I thought that was going to kill me

200
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,680
when I was no cuz if I'm used to it and

201
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,120

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,680
thing with that if one of you guys

going to kill me before you would what's

205
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,479
the what's the craziest conspiracy

206
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,360
theory you've ever like heard on the

207
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,080
internet my favorite is when they like

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,520
they find like a missing person and then

209
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,360
like a celebrity and they're like this

210
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,280
celebrity is actually like like they I'm

211
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,840
pretty sure like AV LaVine and Katie

212
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Perry There's like both like a super

213
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,759
severe like theory that both of them are

214
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,800
like missing children that's insane I'm

215
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
pretty sure no cuz like when something's

216
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,960
missing and you don't have it you can

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,440
make up anything you sound crazy no I

218
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,479
don't no I don't if I got rid of this

219
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,760
football

220
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,159
there's a golden football missing no I

221
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,880
wouldn't say that I'd say like there's a

222
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,240
football right now on vacation not what

223
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,719
I'm saying at

224
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,519
all what I'm saying is like if I lost my

225
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,440
wallet I could be like I lost my wallet

226
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,320
and it has millions of dollars in it

227
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,080
like I need it back okay and then if you

228
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,760
found a wallet that had a ton of

229
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,000
money the whole world would be like

230
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,839
that's his wallet cuz he said that I'm

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,800
missing my Lamborghini like no no that's

232
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,079
where my hug

233
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,519
at I I feel like I was going to say

234
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,640
something there's a lot of different

235
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,800
feel like I could have got goad what is

236
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,440
your what is your biggest internet

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
conspiracy that's what it was that's

238
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,160
what I was going to

239
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,360
say that we're not actually triplets and

240
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,640
two of us are photoshopped in yeah I

241
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,800
don't know who thought that one that

242
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,560
kind of sick that'd be crazy if I was

243
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,040
just like a super surge editor like

244
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,920
ready to edit the day away imagine

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,760
making glitch in that exact moment as

246
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,839
you're saying that I can't do that I

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,240
don't do this okay whatever isn't it

248
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,360
kind of crazy that I edit the videos

249
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,720
like I feel really great like yes we

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
collectively have like 6 million

251
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,640
something subscribers but I feel like

252
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,240
it's like the videos I create have

253
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,959
gained us six something million

254
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,320
subscribers that's all me like I kind of

255
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,760
did kind of eat that I know we just

256
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,880
talked about wizards but if you were a

257
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,240
wizard what would like your specialty be

258
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,600

259
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,360

260
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,040

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,240

don't know but I'll join the game too if

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:51,120
you want I'd probably say Minecraft

310
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,800
[ __ ] typical mat answer bookie I'd

311
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,160
farm animals and I'd get hang up

312
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,519
painting seems like i' go outside and

go ahead go ahead m m boy um it just

316
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,120
seems like such a simple

317
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,560
life crafting building a little hot how

318
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,160
about this conversation that happened at

319
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,440
the Minecraft headquarters when the guy

320
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,360
figured out the game and he's telling

321
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,279
his friends he's like so the main basis

322
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,800
of the game is you mine new craft do you

323
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,240
think they came up with the like concept

324
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,360
of the game of mine like what came first

325
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Minecraft or Mining and crafting I think

326
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,040
it just sounds really nice together it's

327
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,240
almost like peanut butter and jelly

328
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,279
peanut butter and jelly don't don't

329
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,959
sound that good together yeah but it's

330
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,680
now it does because of how much people

331
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,600
put peanut butter and jelly together

332
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,240
yeah I don't know I feel like I really

333
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,199
need to sit at a burger joint and eat a

334
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,839
burger with you guys very soon no like I

335
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,680
just haven't sat down in like a has this

336
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,160
thing going out of the house and like

337
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,760
fears going places but then we'll like

338
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,480
drive by a restaurant and be like we

339
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,079
need to go there and text like five of

340
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,600
our friends be like we got to go eat

341
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,639
this and then we just don't ever well

342
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,880
restaurants is one of my most enjoyable

343
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,360
experiences I love being out to eat I

344
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,959
think my like top 10 memories are like M

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,480
50% in restaurants call me nuts call me

346
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,720
totally nuts I think

347
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,720
that so you got food Island up and

348
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,440
running knocking like every single time

349
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,360
they inside out too I think it's crazy

350
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,839
that you can that that it is so

351
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,639
difficult and I have to go to like the

post office and the store and get my

353
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,839
photo taken to and the DMV to get an ID

354
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,760

355
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,680
stuff but all I need to get a key to

362
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,639

467
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,120

the only thing that went through my head

476
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,080
is the fact that if somebody I don't

477
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,400

478
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,159
