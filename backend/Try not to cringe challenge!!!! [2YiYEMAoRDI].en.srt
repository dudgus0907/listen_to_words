157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,699
which origin really matters to whether

158
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,259
or not they're a 10 or not if they're

159
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,819
like they're 10 but they're for Mars

176
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,500
just look like us but significantly

177
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,280

just like way too sketchy I don't know

186
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:31,139
why we decided to do it but we always go

187
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,440
to parking lots at 2 A.M we expect it

188
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,120
not to be spooky and scary I pretend but

189
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,880
they don't wash their hands after the

190
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,180
loo what

191
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,180
happened

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,039
but I feel like it's kidding me what are

193
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,800
you gonna say he's gonna say it's not

194
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,520
that important to wash their hands

195
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,319
cool okay there are 10 but they claim

196
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,680
that they don't do normal things like oh

197
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,199
I don't sweat I don't sneeze I feel like

198
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,060
that's kind of like valid

199
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,099
you would he would be one because it's

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,199
like if you don't just like you don't

201
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,539
it's what everyone [ __ ] sweats okay

202
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,680
sure you can have that if you want I'm

203
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,440
really uncomfortable but it's the people

204
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,120
it's the people that make it Chris

205
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,560
people that make it like a big jab that

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,300
they wanted no I guess it's like when

207
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,479
someone says like oh my God I'm sweating

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,039
it so oh like I don't sweat like ever

209
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,360
so it's just those people that want you

210
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,580
to know something about them that you

211
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,520

216
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,399
that's okay it depends their background

217
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,539
but it totally depends how like if

218
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,099

219
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,560
