1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
Fuse. We're on a mission to accelerate

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,240
the world's transition to fusion energy.

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,000
One of the only fusion companies that's

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
actually making revenue. Started a

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
company almost 6 years ago now. I was 19

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,000
at the time. Yeah. Never went to

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
college. I never even submitted an

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,560
application. Why do I need to convince

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
an admission officer to like let me sit

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
in a classroom for 4 years to then get a

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
piece of paper that says I can

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
potentially do something versus just do

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
something and prove you can do it. life

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
is too short and there's like 7 billion

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,280
or more people on earth. So you just

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,200
always ask yourself like why am I doing

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
something that actually matters or like

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
how can I contribute and I felt that

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,480
there's a a real way to contribute to

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
work on something that could be um

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,480
civilization altering starting company

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
was the fastest way to make progress I

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,239
thought I'm Jes I'm the founder and CEO

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,640
of fuse we're the only fusion company

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,879
that has delivered experimental results

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
of a new technology ology that was no

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,280
one has built it before and published

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,520
the results in nature. We've raised over

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,240
$50 million of capital. We work with the

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
US military and US government. March 13,

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,640
we we've proven the machine at scale and

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
now we have contracts to commercialize

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,960
[Music]

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,720
it. My father's a nuclear physicist, so

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
growing up was just very curious about

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,680
how the world works. You know, I've

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,439
always liked to work on hard things and

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
explore research topics. And then I very

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,439
quickly learned that maybe spending time

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,119
in academic environment was not the

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,520
fastest way to make progress on

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,600
technology. So that's why I decided to

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,159
start you know my own company. I had

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
started a nonprofit in education. The TS

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,399
as a teenager things it was really hard

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
to you know build things. It's you can't

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,880
even get a credit card as under 18 which

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,200
is you know pretty funny. you know, you

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
cannot open a Shopify online store if

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
you're under 18, which is kind of

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
ridiculous considering all the other

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,640
things you can do. So, I started a

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,719
nonprofit to essentially liberate

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,560
teenagers to dare and and to create. And

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,640
we were funded by Google.org, the

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Canadian government, and and others. And

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,040
we built that into pretty uh successful

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
program. And we had some teenagers that

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,599
now are off to doing great things. What

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,080
I've done to date is a good example for

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
others to realize that it's possible. If

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
you really want to build something and

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
you truly have the grit and tenacity,

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,400
you can. A lot of people, you know,

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
being young is has a competitive edge

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
because you're naive and you've got a

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,319
lot of stamina and energy. Definitely

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,720
those early wins give you an early taste

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,040
at freedom. You know, choosing to start

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,720
as early as possible maximizes, you

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
know, your chance at getting it right.

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,560
And even if you fail, you make you burn

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
yourself a little bit, as long as you

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,319
don't die or don't go to jail, I think

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,319
everything else can be tolerated and

76
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,480
repaired. You know, I felt that there's

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,120
a a real way to contribute to work on

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,440
something civilization altering like a

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,599
civilization scale and and history.

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,599
every technology progress or

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,760
civilizational development has been tied

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,519
to like how much kilowatt hour is

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
available per capita. So when you think

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,080
about the industrial revolution and how

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,319
that enabled the whole human prosperity

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
and and technological advancements and

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,800
you can tie that to coal afterwards and

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,959
chemical era and I believe that fusion

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
would unlock the next level of human

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,239
prosperity you know the rise of the

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
social middle class the rise of AI of

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
quantum technologies like all of those

93
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,879
critical technologies they need energy

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
and without energy we can't have AI like

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,480
how would you power all the data centers

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,480
do you want it at the cost of people not

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
being able to turn their lights on at

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,720
the house. I don't think so. And so we

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
will need significantly more energy and

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,040
fusion is not the only ways to actually

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
make that. So Titan is the world's

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
highest power and highest energy

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
impedance match Mars generator of its

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,200
kind. What that matters to think about

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200
it as a giant battery that releases all

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,879
of its energy really fast like in a

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
billionth of a second. It's a very

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,720
important question to ask. Is this a

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,640
scientific nonprofit or is there a

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
business here? cuz a lot of time people

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
solve are building companies and I I

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,840
wonder if that's better to be like a

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
scientific research that's like

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,720
nonprofit funded or grandfunded versus

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,320
is this a business or a real company.

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
Then the second is like really to

117
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
question the fundamentals and what we've

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,800
done for Titan was built in-house like

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,880
over 80% of the Titan subsystems and

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
components were built in-house at Fuse

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,800
and so we took on the project knowing

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,320
that we have the capacity to solve a lot

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
of the problems and we vertically

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,199
integrated which meant that as problems

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
were arising we were able to solve them

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,600
inhouse. building companies like you you

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,280
always are updating the operating system

128
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
is like an app you know and you you have

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
to constantly debug and upgrade the

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,759
operating system and you need different

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,440
version for every 6 months or so. So you

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
know very intentionally taking time to

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,800
be introspective and to think about you

134
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
know what has changed now. This is not

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
the same company that it was before.

136
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,040
Obviously the core fundamentals are the

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,880
same but you know the way it operates is

138
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,720
is different and bringing the right

139
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,160
resources you know around you. You know

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,240
there's people who are really good at

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
the early stage and then you need a

142
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
different type of skill set and and

143
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
culture for growth stage and bringing in

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
different people at the right time and

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
having the introspection to think of

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,160
what needs to be changed, what bugs need

147
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,000
to be fixed and how to upgrade the

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
operating system for the next phase is

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
very

150
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,240
important. Certainly the company has

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
come close to running out of capital at

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,759
few moments in time. you know we we had

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
some you know technology that at some

154
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
point you know did not go as we had

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
planned or we had run out of capital and

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,400
we had to make really hard decisions but

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
you know these are the moment that

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,160
really define who we are you know just

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,160
building this connective tissue as a

160
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,479
team and this resilience the one thing

161
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
that has been really awesome is like I'm

162
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,479
young myself but we've built a team with

163
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,400
you know some really experienced people

164
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
from different aspects uh of the

165
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
government I had the fortune to work

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,319
with some really smart people with some

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
of the best people I've met fortunate

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
enough that they're now part of one team

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and we're multiple vectors pointing in

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,919
one direction and just if you're humble

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,759
and you bring people that really can

172
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,919
compleiment you that's a strength not a

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,639
weakness. It's really important to be

174
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
audacious and daring but also humble and

175
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
it's your challenge to figure out how to

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
overcome that will save you a lot of

177
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
peace and help attract some great people

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,720
where you recognize your weaknesses and

179
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,479
vulnerabilities and build around them.

180
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,400
that team is that mindset like most

181
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,479
people actually want to be in

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
environments where you know they're all

183
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,199
contributing and learning from each

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
other that's at least a healthy

185
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
environment. We also really care about

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
you know people who are just focused on

187
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,680
getting done and you know getting

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
the job done whatever it is versus know

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,319
just talking. So we we have a really

190
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,000
default for people who take agency who

191
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,000
are autonomous and just want to get

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
done who are really curious and third

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,919
just give a you know like the

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
people on our team really care. They

195
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,680
stay up till 4:00 a.m. when we have a

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
mission. They work on the weekends. They

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
just go out of their own way to to do

198
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
the job and like pick up the trash if

199
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,759
needs be. You know, give a and care

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,560
and just want to get done and just

201
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,840
focus on that. I think you can get a lot

202
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,759
done. It's It's actually really funny

203
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
when people think that entrepreneurs are

204
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
very big risk takers. I think like great

205
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
entrepreneurs are really good like risk

206
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
hedgers. Like the day you start the

207
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
company, you've taken the most amount of

208
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
risk and then your job all along is to

209
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
retire risk and like choose very

210
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,360
selectively which risk to derisk first

211
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
and how to sequentially do that. for

212
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
founders to think about risk mitigation

213
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
as well as know equipping yourself with

214
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,199
the right tool and most importantly with

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,199
the right people.
