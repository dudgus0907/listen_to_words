video really quick to tell you about

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,520
Opera Opera is one of the safest and

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,159
most secure internet browsers because

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,080
our job is social media we want an

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
internet browser that's trusty and easy

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,560
to use and that's why we use Opera we

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,880
also use Opera because it includes many

37
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,479
helpful features Opera has a built-in

38
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,840
VPN which is awesome because it can

39
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,520
protect your privacy while using the web

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
it also has a built-in ad blocker which

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,600
makes browsing and searching easy it

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,920

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,400
can easily help us find video topics or

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,159
answer the ridiculous questions we get

45
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,119
during car videos with Opera you can

46
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,799

your searching can be super organized

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,040

49
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,079
too many tabs open for example we have

50
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,040

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,920

217
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,479
and you have to like peek over the

218
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,159
little nut sack rolling around in the

219
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,080
jar to see him this might turn into what

220
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,639
sounds like an infomercial have you ever

221
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,560
been sitting at home bored and want

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
something to do with friends this does

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,039
sound like an info mercial just like it

224
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
have you ever wanted to go out but have

225
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,159
nothing to do yeah Chris has the

226
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,839
solution oh God

227
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,519
I want to invent a game and this might

228
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,640
literally get cut out cuz I might

229
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,479
actually do it do you know Pokémon go

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,360
how you have to go to certain places in

231
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,000
real life and catch Pokemon or scan Poké

232
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,880
stops very familiar love it I want it to

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,640
be based on cities and then you can

234
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,680
select your teammates and then you can

235
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,959
work together to complete local missions

236
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,440
so that way say we're back home we could

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,160
say we are going to be in Boston we have

238
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,920
a team of me Matt Nick Justin and Nathan

239
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,399
and we're going to be here from like

240
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,360
September 1st to September 30th we need

241
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,360
missions to do right and then we all get

242
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,839
on our server and we all meet up

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,560
together and then it says like go to

244
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,480
like blanket like the Chipotle on this

245
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,000
street and you have to go there and

246
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,560
solve your first virtual Mission and

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,200
then it tells you like a next step and

248
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,000
it's like an IRL Capture the Flag game

249
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,760
but all virtual that you can play with

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,480
friends and you can get like awarded

251
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,560
ranks and like how many missions you

252
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,760
complete and you

253
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,519
canel I delete the app in an hour what

254
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,519
it' tell me it' be like go here no but

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,480
it can it it would get so viral that

256
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,480
people are like competing to like do

257
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,880
like specific challenges you can travel

258
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,279
like oh my God we should do like a

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,079
national park it's going to get taken

260
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,680
too far I think it's not I think that

261
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:50,079
you need to going be or something people

262
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,600
are going you need to work on you need

263
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,200
to work on what your missions are and

264
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,839
then I can see this getting something

265
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,880
but the fact that you're like in this

266
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,920
blind right now I don't really like if

267
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,120
some if that game gets created and sold

268
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,320
for millions of dollars what is it that

269
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,839
you predicted in our podcast what was

270
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,360
that that was crazy I forget I was

271
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,079
talking about how there should be like a

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
like a portal in Time Square or

273
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,600
something and then it happened yeah

274
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,600
helling you I got some good

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,160
ideas you're just s if there is a if

276
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,000
there is a a capture the flag teammate

277
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,279
game that you can do in your local city

278
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,440
with your friends are you capturing

279
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,800
Flags it it's like it's more of treasure

280
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,200
hunt it's like Outer Banks how how many

281
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,399
times do you watch Outer Banks or

282
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,160
Adventure kid movies like and you want

283
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,839
to be them this is your chance you can

284
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,880
make a little Avatar that's the app

285
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,959
description you going to be like little

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,760
like maybe like brand Integrations like

287
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,000
oh you have to go get a Sprite for one

288
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,120
of the missions and it's like an

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,760
advertisement paid by Sprite so there's

290
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
money in the game and then you can do

291
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,040
cash rewards and like the top of the

292
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,680
world can get paid to like like I'm it's

293
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,079
a whole thing yeah you're cooking it's a

294
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,839
whole thing how good of an idea is that

295
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,120
maybe an app developer will watch this

296
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,000
and he'll created it I need my cut or

297
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,040
she I need my cut I feel like I am

298
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,920
literally one of the only people that

299
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,480
genuinely count sheep to fall asleep no

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,399
you don't I swear to God are they

301
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,920
hopping over a fence or I was laying

302
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,399
down listen can you finish can you stop

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,839
I mean and I literally virtually

304
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,880
pictured a little sheep going like this

305
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,920
like one not virtual or mentally one and

306
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
do you know what it looked like do you

307
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,600
know that mattress that literally has

308
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
that like one sheep Serta and it's

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,440
should like that's what I picture and I

310
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,959
literally go one two and it helps me

311
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,399
fall asleep and what it made me think

312
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,760
and what it made me think what it made

313
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,600
me think is oh my God if other people

314
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,399
count sheep to go to bed when do you

315
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
feel the most scared and vulnerable at

316
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,120
night or when do you feel the most

317
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,839
scared and vulner when do you feel the

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
most scared and vulnerable in your life

319
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,959
at night right right before you're going

320
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,720
to fall asleep I figured that's the

321
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,440
answer new idea I'm creating the

322
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,920
counting sheep horror movie and it's

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,639
basically going to be something so scary

324
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,760
and like paralyzing you with fear but

325
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,959
during the movie there's going to be

326
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,880
like little sheep hopping over the fence

327
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,519
or something I haven't got the concept

328
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,920
down yet but basically what basically

329
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,519
what's going to happen is it's going to

330
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,040
be some intense crazy horror movie and

331
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,320
every time you go to sleep and you try

332
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
to count sheep you're going to think of

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,079
it and it's going to give you nightmares

334
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,920
and that's going to be the most

335
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,199
successful most scary horror movie of

336
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,199
them all cuz it going of literally how

337
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,320
many sheep how many sheep did you get to

338
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:31,480
the other night I stop at around like 30

339
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,000
every night probably 30 and you're sleep

340
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,279
already well no it just takes my mind

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,800
off what I'm thinking and then it helps

342
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,600
me just rest and go to sleep oh so it's

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,160
not like a it's not like I'm counting

344
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,959
till I doze off no it's like I'm

345
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,560
counting to distract my mind okay I have

346
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,639
think I have the idea of like the

347
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,240
opening scene is the sheet

348
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,600
like well of course of course and then

349
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,639
the closing scene in addition is the so

350
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,360
it's like you're just always like feel

351
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,720
like the she I have the bread I need we

352
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
need the lettuce the Tomato the B

353
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,680
exactly have to bear with me cuz it

354
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,399
starts slow okay is it recording yes

355
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,279
okay so I've never in my life ever in my

356
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,399
life ever in my life done room service

357
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,480
cuz I think that like the way we grew up

358
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,960
paranormal like five or something like I

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,720
like like a six sense I mean there it is

594
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,520
I say triple it double I literally was

595
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
on the ladder I have a little step

596
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,720
ladder in my B in my in my in my closet

597
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,480
cuz I can't see the top of my clothes if

598
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,480
I don't step up okay and I step onto the

599
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,159
second level of the ladder and I'm

600
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,440
sorting through my shorts to grab the

601
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,720
shorts that I'm putting on and I hear

602
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,880
like like literally like that was three

603
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,720
steps and a shuffle back and I thought

604
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,480
that Matt was going to like pull like

605
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,200
something out from behind me and I

606
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,039
turned and I was like Matt no one was

607
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,640
there and I was like what like it was

608
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,960
literally that like that like gives me

609
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,240
chill

610
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,080
I felt I'm not kidding I felt the ladder

611
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,000
shake and I felt like a like a pull like

612
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,320
I thought there was like a shirt under

613
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
in my brain genuinely my pure actual

614
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,720
honest thought was that there was a

615
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
shirt under one of the legs of the

616
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,039
ladder that I was standing on and Matt

617
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,559
followed me to my room and pulled it out

618
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,480
what is that M literally I'm dead

619
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,520
serious I genuinely thought that like I

620
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,000
turned around and went to say something

621
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,000
to Matt and it was the fastest I turned

622
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,600
around ever in my life like as if like

623
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,279
like it was a genuine reaction like I

624
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,960
turned Nick it was like how do you not

625
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,559
and I forgot about it until you just

626
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,559
said that the other day you thought

627
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,039
someone was pranking you wow when you

628
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,559
were had all the clothes I was like

629
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,559
today I thought I was being pranked and

630
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,120
it was a ghost no I do that all the time

631
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,200
like I was laying in my room the other

632
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,360
day and I was taking a nap so I was like

633
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
partially kind of like opening my eyes

634
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,320
here and there but not really and my

635
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,840
room was like that weird like dark

636
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,360
because the curtains are drawn and the

637
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,000
lights are off but but light enough for

638
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,760
me to see everything cuz the Sun is up

639
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,039
you know what I mean and I'm I always

640
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,159
think I'm like what if someone was just

641
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:34,240
standing in like the corner of my room I

642
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,360
Look to check which is a bad habit but

643
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm like if I don't look I'm going to

644
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
[ __ ] if I don't look I'm going to not

645
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,399
be able to sleep like last night I was

646
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,679
going to bed and I was like oh there's

647
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,600
probably someone hovering over behind me

648
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,000
on the other side of like no I have to

649
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,520
look now and I go and I turn and I look

650
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,080
and I'm like imagine if I look and

651
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,520
someone's actually there yeah but I also

652
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,360
like I also just like am okay with it

653
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,399
like I'll look over at my towel like

654
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,840
hanging from my shower like is that a

655
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,120
person that was freaking me out when I

656
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,720
was sleeping in your room while you were

657
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,840
gone it's scary it's really scary I feel

658
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,760
like Morse code should be more like in

659
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,480
your face kind of it's when are you

660
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,880
going to communicate with Morse code

661
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,840
well like for the people that need it

662
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,120
they can't really

663
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,919
see isn't oh I'm thinking of Braille

664
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,919
sorry if you think about it and I'll

665
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,640
actually say this is like sheer honesty

666
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,480
every movie ever is like inaccurate to

667
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,799
real

668
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,840
life like every movie ever cuz when I'm

669
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,840
watching a movie I'm just like oh you

670
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,159
kind of like understand like there's

671
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,320
like the tropes to the movies and stuff

672
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,240
but I'm like when are we going to just

673
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,360
like make a movie where like people are

674
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,120
in like a life or death situation and

675
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,399
they don't survive because they

676
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,000
obviously wouldn't know how to [ __ ]

677
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,399
get out of this it's like in the life or

678
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,279
death situation it's like someone's like

679
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,440
oh I know how to [ __ ] pick a lock and

680
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,000
backflip it's like no you don't yeah

681
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,360
like stop joking every movie ever is

682
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,440
unrealistic and yes I understand that

683
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,600
movies wouldn't exist if they weren't

684
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,640
