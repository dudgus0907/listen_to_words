00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,680
Next up is a big idea for those who

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,680
think

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,240
[Music]

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,840
small. Hello Sharks. My name is Jared

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,080
Waters. I am from Portland, Oregon, and

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,400
I am seeking

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,439
$100,000 in exchange for 20% equity in

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,160
my company. Sharks. The world has been

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,600
through a lot of big changes these past

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,559
few years. A big pandemic, a big

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,280
recession. In fact, all of our problems

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:44,079
have gotten too dang big. We need

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,440
more cute in the world. It's time to

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,440
think

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,440
small.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Smaller.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Smaller. Smaller.

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,440
That's what I'm talking

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,119
about. Introducing Mini

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,200
Materials. Authentic, highquality,

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,360
modern miniature building supplies for

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,640
dollhouse construction, diaramas, and

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,280
two-scale recreations. We deliver joy by

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
the pallet

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,240
load. We use innovative techniques to

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,479
bring high-quality products that are

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,119
made in the USA. And they are as real as

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,880
they are adorable.

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,119
A real concrete, real wood, even real

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,759
metal. Traditional dollhouse companies

31
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,640
do Victorian molding. We do brief

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,119
blocks. They do picket fences. We do

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
jersey barriers. They do doilies and

34
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,360
frills. We do moving dollies and pallet

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,520
jackets. That's pretty good. We are not

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
your grandmother's dollhouse company. We

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,439
cater to a new generation of creatives

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,560
who make art with fingerboards and

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,479
action figures and RC crawlers. If your

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,640
hobby is small, then we are the perfect

41
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,680
fit. Now, Sharks, we don't like to make

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
guarantees about gains, but after one

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,119
day with many materials, you will be

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,280
able to lift an entire pallet of cinder

45
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,400
blocks over your head with one

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,440
hand. So, Sharks, who wants to

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
demolish a stagnant industry and make a

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,599
big deal with many materials? That's

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,040
great. Good job. Good job. Bravo.

50
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,720
Why? Why does anybody need any of this?

51
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,560
It's a toy. What are you talking about?

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,000
Because people need joy. And everybody

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,519
has some samples in front of them if you

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
guys want to start playing. I'm here to

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,519
answer questions when you're done

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,760
playing with. Oh, that's

57
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,840
so from someone who has had to wrap a

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,239
lot of pallets. This is adorable. Thank

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
you. When you said this is real

60
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
concrete. Yeah. This is real. Yes. It's

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,360
actually mortar. It's actually mortar.

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah. So cute. Look, even a little buzz

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,239
sock. 15 years, never seen anything like

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,239
this. Super cute.

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,720
How does it translate into sales? Give

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
us an idea of when you started this and

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,519
what occurred. I actually bought the

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
business one year and one month ago. Oh,

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,720
okay. So, the business has a lot to do

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,720
with Reddit with the online form Reddit.

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Yeah. One of the original co-founders

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,879
was looking on Reddit and somebody had

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
handmade a concrete block and they were

74
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,879
like, "That is awesome." And so he

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,800
started making them and then he put it

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
on Reddit as well saying look I have

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
this whole pallet with cinder blocks and

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
people were like I love that. Went to

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
the front page of our went to the front

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,120
page of Reddit again. Dang. So lo and

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,360
behold pretty soon they had a very

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,440
healthy side business. I came across

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
this post. Hey I have a business and I'm

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,440
looking to sell it. So I reached out via

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,200
Reddit and ended up purchasing the

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
company from them. What did you buy the

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,920
business for? 200,000. And where did you

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,239
get the money for that Jared? So I took

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,680
uh heliloc against my house. So wow you

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,360
really you went all in. I did. I have

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
been always wanting to start a business.

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
What attracted me to this is it's making

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,040
things. And what what are your margins

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
on this? So on an individual product

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,599
basis they go from 50 to like

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,959
93% with blended rate of about 75%. Oh

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,519
that's not bad at all. What are your

98
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,959
sales? So in the last year I've done

99
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,359
$200,000 in sales. Good for you. Yeah.

100
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,359
And you own it 100%. And you're making

101
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
them? I make them. Yeah. How much does

102
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,919
this sell for? Uh, that one without the

103
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,199
logo printed on it is $20. And what does

104
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,040
it cost you to make this? $4. That's

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
pretty pricey. So, this is really for

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
enthusiasts or hobbyists that are

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
probably a little more mature. Is this

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
for children? Really? Like, I'm trying

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,720
to get the the the age like 8 to 12 is

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,199
what my packaging guidelines recommend.

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
What's the average? Um I don't know if I

112
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,520
have a hard number on that that I would

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,040
be 100% confident in saying I I do know

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,880
generally. Uh so generally well what do

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
you see on let's talk social media is

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,360
that answer my question. Well because he

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,720
doesn't know his

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,720
demographic in that reason I'm out.

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
So what do you do with social media? You

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
know I could see this like doing a lot

121
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
of stop action animation and stop

122
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,600
animation. People do stop animation with

123
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
things for sure. But are you doing any

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,919
of that to increase sales? I am. But one

125
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759
of the reasons I'm here right now is

126
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,919
marketing is my biggest weakness as a

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
company. I'm not horrible at it. Tell us

128
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,240
about your background. Uh I'm doing this

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,800
full-time right now. I grew up in rural

130
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,360
Idaho, went to a two- room schoolhouse.

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,039
Uh and then after I graduated, I moved

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,120
to Portland. I blinked and got up my

133
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,360
first real professional job. Blinked and

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,360
then was married. Blinked and had kids.

135
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
Blinked and had a house. And life just

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
was flying by. And this like desire to

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,440
start a business was always there, but

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
starting a business and not having sales

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,080
just seemed slightly irresponsible for

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,880
having kids and having a mortgage. I

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,039
love how you said that. You know, I

142
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,120
blinked and 15 years later, two words

143
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,199
have never been broken. Yeah. Life just

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,840
goes, "You have a business." Are you

145
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,919
making money on the 200,000? I am making

146
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
money. Yes. Are you paying yourself? How

147
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,360
much? I am paying myself. So, so far in

148
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,039
that last year and a month, I have

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
pulled out about 55,000 out of the

150
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,000
business. Good for you. Good for you.

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,240
You know, it's it's really interesting.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,080
I can see a forever perpetual demand for

153
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,479
it from a very small segment of the

154
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,720
market. Everything about it is small,

155
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,400
literally. Yeah. And and that makes it a

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,319
difficult investment for me cuz I mean,

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
I don't know how you blow this thing up.

158
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,440
It's just too small for me. Jared, I'm

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,280
out. I'm sorry to hear that. I do think

160
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,080
there is a lot of good upside. I think

161
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,919
it's cute as can be. It's not a business

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,560
for me, but I think it's a great

163
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,720
business for you, and I wish you good

164
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
luck, but I'm out.

165
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,759
Thank you, Jared. I blinked and I've

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,520
been here for 15 years. Um, what I've

167
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,840
learned is if you have a good business,

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,720
you can get it to 2 to 3 million by

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,600
sheer willpower of your execution. You

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,319
can make a fantastic living, but as an

171
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,080
investor, I need to see more scale. I

172
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
don't see it beyond that. So, I'm going

173
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,840
to be out just for that. wish you all

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,000
the best.

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,560
So uh I think there is upwards of room

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,360
for Jared entrepreneurs are willing to

177
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,319
take the pain of working working to

178
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,720
avoid the pain of looking back when

179
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
you're 70 80 90 years old and never had

180
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
tried. Yes. And so you get a ton of

181
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,440
credit for going for it. I think this

182
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,319
business can be successful, but because

183
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
it's so new in inventing a new industry

184
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,080
in a lot of respects, it could take

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,280
decades, right? And I know that you

186
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
don't want to hear that sound of it.

187
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,199
That's a lot of pain. But I I just I'm

188
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,039
not ready to go along for that long a

189
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,360
ride. So, for those reasons, I'm out.

190
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,960
Everybody loves the product. Love it.

191
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
You just got to grind it out. Jared, it

192
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
is very cool. Jared, you really have

193
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
something here. And it'll never happen

194
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
fast enough, but when you blink again,

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,759
it could be a two, three, four million

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,440
dollar business with a million dollars

197
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,960
in your pocket. Yeah. All right, man.

198
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,960
Good luck for Thank you guys.
