1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
okay

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,000
um Mac you go check that we have to

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,980
seriously the theory relies on who

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,900
checks right now no match I'll go I

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,519
never go I'll go I'm because I feel like

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,960
it might change something well we have

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,820
to introduce this as like the second

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,260
part

9
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,660
and then what you're saying how you miss

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,660
me yeah you miss me and all the things

11
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,399
what's up guys we're back and we're

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,800
filming the second part of what we just

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,840
filmed because we all have more thoughts

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,160
and want to talk about it so we were

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
like why not just keep filming because

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,160
this is what we do every night but we'll

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,219
just leave the camera on and let us know

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,840
if you like like I don't know like

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,700
what

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,640
what I figured it out

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,559
this is crazy shut this off Nick shut

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,660
your AC off like I was just thinking

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,760
about oh dude he sounds like a dog from

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,379
Back to the Future like I figured it out

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
because the reason I'm thinking about it

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,799
is because I'm definitely just talking

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,100
about a movie right now

28
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,720
Back to the Future No that's what no the

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,439
future is he's going back to the future

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
no

31
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,000
but what I'm saying is they just made

32
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,560
that Netflix movie that we went to watch

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,680
the premiere of

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,759
but look both ways and it was that one

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,200
moment whether or not you became

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,759
pregnant or not affected her whole life

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,619
correct and it showed the two different

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,240
but it's like we're talking more than

39
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,680
that we're not talking more than that

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,180
but I'm but I'm just thinking that's why

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,979
I have this thought which goes back to

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,740
my proving point that nothing is fantasy

43
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,780
everything happened correct because that

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,280
probably actually happen to someone oh

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,540
my God yeah we're talking about the

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,939
government and [ __ ] if you didn't watch

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,920
last week's video watch last week's

48
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,799
video first crucial and then come back

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,899
right away okay but I just think like

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,820
like you grow up with like favorite

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,140
things this is my favorite color this is

52
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,640
my favorite book this is my favorite

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,439
movie this is my favorite thing parents

54
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,060
but then you look at that too correct

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,240
who's influencing your parents your

56
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,979
grandparents but also hold on you also

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,459
think Matt can you get something out of

58
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,560
you I don't know cause hold on think

59
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,800
about it those things when you're a kid

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,420
you grow up may forget about them all

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,040
it's one of them might stick but you

62
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,739
might forget about a lot of them but it

63
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,660
still matters deep within what your

64
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,540
favorite things were like it may not

65
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,700
matter as seriously as you think but all

66
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,239
of those things that you consume as a

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,060
child like the internet like all those

68
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,099
things have a lasting effect on what's

69
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,959
happening to you now I don't know why

70
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,379
Nick's Antics are just making me laugh

71
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,379
right now

72
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:49,040
like what do you think like where are

73
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,040
you in that moment

74
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,239
do you ever feel like you could do

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,040
something like like hold on orange juice

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
like over the top no let's get out of

77
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,760
that that's okay think think I have one

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,500
no I have one hold on hold on okay hold

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,540
on I'm not gonna let you talk the whole

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,000
time I'm gonna say one more [ __ ]

81
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,700
thing let me go no all right think about

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,220
it if you're like if you're like goal

83
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,159
you're on a walk right bro

84
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,220
what are you looking at can I finish and

85
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,819
then you can speak my thought is if

86
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,560
you're don't do that if you're like if

87
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,000
you're walking on like a path and your

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,800
goal is like trip someone walking

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,239
towards you oh that's a bad goal like

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,000
you just want to trick someone you gotta

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,159
you have to trip one person what if you

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,980
trip the wrong person

93
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,060
everything could change

94
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,980
do you know what I'm saying like if

95
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,480
you're going like like if you if you're

96
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,760
like well you're debating oh I'm gonna

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,760
try oh and then you just let them walk

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,120
past when you trip the next person

99
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,720
huh it could be so different I use you

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,459
ready for this the street light Theory

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,680
every single time I know what you mean

102
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,659
hit a red light I hear you if you if it

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,159
was yellow and you went through it you

104
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,019
could get in like a car accident and die

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,640
like five minutes in the future and not

106
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,239
even know it or if you hit a red light

107
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,239
and you're all mad

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,459
because it's like imagine you get to a

109
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,079
red light and you're like oh [ __ ] I

110
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,699
missed that red light yes but you would

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,220
be saying oh [ __ ] I'm dead in five

112
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,840
minutes correct like isn't that I think

113
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,520
the same thing I think of that all the

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,139
time like when we hit like a red light

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,460
or like if we leave the house and Mom's

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,320
like wait one second boys I want to like

117
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,540
give you something I'm like what if mom

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,419
giving us this thing puts us in a crash

119
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,160
like no puts us like not in the crash

120
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,440
like imagine we were about to leave and

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,240
get in a crash but then Mom just asking

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,600
us to like stay in and grab one thing

123
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,880
didn't like perfect timing that's a

124
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,320
perfect timing no perfect timing yeah

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,699
like the stars yeah

126
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,900
we flooded with diamonds like I just

127
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,440
think of I don't know what the time is

128
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,600
hold on I think I'm like nav shout out

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,940
my brother I think I'm like even bust

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,979
down Rollie flutter with diamonds enough

131
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,620
can't tell what the time is I just know

132
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,900
it's perfect I don't know like uh piano

133
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,520
man man oh man what give me something

134
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,720
else I don't know because I like these

135
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,520
theories but it's like I don't got

136
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,139
enough of them to keep going right now

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,979
talk about like everything happens for a

138
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,199
reason

139
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,639
that's you bud but I know but I believe

140
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,500
it but I just want to give you a chance

141
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,020
to talk about it before I do I don't

142
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,820
know like what you want me to talk about

143
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,180
okay wait I have a question go do you

144
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,900
guys do you think

145
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,639
no cause you talking Talking Tom

146
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,500
okay so I'm gonna right now do you think

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,600
there's certain people set in our paths

148
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,280
by like a higher being like the

149
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,020
government and [ __ ] like ascending

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,080
people into like local places just to

151
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,300
like survey the area no oh my God no

152
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,919
like you don't need to go get that

153
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,639
AutoZone now we need to see what's going

154
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,620
on no really no no I feel that way a lot

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,120
like do you ever think I think I think

156
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,800
there's a dog if there's a thousand

157
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,139
people in a Target there's no way one's

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,120
not one can you wanna hear me out oh my

159
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,440
God

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,320
I think there's a difference in between

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,840
thinking this Theory but then also being

162
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,160
a paranoid schizophrenic no and I think

163
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,440
because we're not paranoid if we don't

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
let it alter I think I just think of

165
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,400
like

166
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,960
what Alters life because Nick will walk

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
around and he'll I just think like oh

168
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,080
we're going to Home Depot if you go to

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,280
Home Depot right and you have the goal

170
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,139
oh I'm buying a hammer today because I

171
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,060
need to hammer now that's your end goal

172
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,380
for going into that Home Depot with that

173
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,199
hammer you're going to get a hammer so

174
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,819
you can hammer now correct yes then I

175
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,060
think oh someone else could be walking

176
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,680
around Home Depot

177
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,300
placed by the government holding a two

178
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,419
by four on their shoulder and they're

179
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,400
just like oh walk around because we need

180
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,500
you to find John oh my God I was looking

181
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,479
for a hammer because John is gonna

182
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,639
hammer a nail and then that nail is

183
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,680
gonna go through the wall knock a poster

184
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,080
of the other neighbor neighboring

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,319
apartment wall and it's gonna hit their

186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
kids

187
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,580
hospital because they just know I don't

188
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,259
even think it's like the government like

189
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,759
they know what's good like I think it's

190
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,500
more of like Time Travelers that come

191
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,479
back

192
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,100
is there time travelers that like lurk

193
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,479
this because then they could have the

194
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,400
orange juice from the previous video

195
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,319
they could be like the guy could just be

196
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,060
like hey if you see someone walking

197
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,740
through in Home Depot with a hammer

what not you know the whole thing

221
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,479
played back a little bit different right

222
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,240
did you know this is a proven fact by

223
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,099
the way very very true by who this is

224
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,300
real life but this happens see my thing

225
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:22,139
is I don't trust proven facts

226
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,699
you'll be like oh yeah that's true

227
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,800
because people have confirmed that that

228
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,440
work there you ready

229
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,520
jelly beans what I thought you were

230
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,520
gonna talk about like a candy factory

231
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,039
people at like carnivals and fairs pay

232
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,140
people just normal everyday looking

233
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,880
people to win the games no no not to win

234
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,680
the game The Walker revises he'll walk

235
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,860
around with the biggest stuffed animals

236
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,779
all day long just so that it looks like

237
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,459
the government that's like how the

238
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,399
government that's the government on a

239
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,080
minor scale correct yeah it's putting

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,820
false hope right in front of these

241
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,700
people's faces and then dangling it away

242
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,260
I'm choking them out and killing them

243
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,540
like some guy that working what if one

244
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,000
day I was just walking down like a

245
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,279
series oh man some dude working at a

246

foot teddy bear for like hours

249
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,140
open to close because if you walk by

251
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,440

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,000

game that he wanted at on on a bench for

255
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,660

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,399
twice a week this guy's need to go home

257
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,779
I've seen him so many times but like

258
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,220
like they must have such a specific

259
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,720
routine tonight what if I was walking

260
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,200
down there

261
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200

264
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,200
I don't like to listen when someone

265
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,120
starts with that okay can you listen to

266
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,060
me for a minute of course okay

267
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,440
imagine this right hold on let me get

268
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,540
comfortable oh

269
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,540
if you imagine if hold on I'm gonna put

270
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,180
in this parking lot imagine if there was

271
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,459
someone who started like over there and

272
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,600
they were just walking past us and we

273
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,800
were all like oh look like I walk and

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,839
walk or whatever and we're all just

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,100
chilling and we all like looked like

276
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,660
this way for a second because like

277
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,760
something went over there and we look

278
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,100
back nowhere to be found like he like

279
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,440
vanished from thin air no do we believe

280
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,600
in time traveling I I believe in like

281
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,339
some like there's definitely like

282
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,500
something that just like can happen like

283
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,880
do you ever walk up like the eye is such

284
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,580
like a deceiving thing because you can

285
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,959
like we can see this AutoZone but we

286
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,820
don't know what's going inside think

287
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,440
about this hold on every single one of

288
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,200
these places around us every single one

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,540
was put there built serves a purpose

290
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,160
painted colored put exactly how it is

291
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,660
right where it is right now have you

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,079
ever been in that building no how long

293
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,300
have you lived in the city my whole life

294
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,040
they could be running the government in

295
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,079
there and none of us know about it right

296
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,519
under Arc noses or I just go to a

297
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,260
different Auto Body well I'm just

298
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,420
talking like in general

299
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,060
every single like you could walk by like

300
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,100
every I think every person never walk by

301
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,640
Time Travelers but yeah I know

302
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,380
yes yeah I'm on to you the one in L.A um

303
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,560
you just walk by and be like I'm on to

304
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,899
you no because it's usually like what

305
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,399
would be oh my God what are the top

306
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,380
three dead giveaways to you that that

307
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,839
person's a time traveler go I have mine

308
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,420
one the way they just walk when they

309
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,339
walk up in the step when they walk no

310
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,600
way we should make this a guide after we

311
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,600
talk about it we'll say hey

312
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,279
when they know when they're on a clear

313
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,440
path like up on this know where they're

314
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,880
going correct like if someone's like if

315
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,220
someone started walking from there to

316
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,440
there full speed not even like looking

317
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,660
other directions just no like even for

318
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,700
checking for cars I think crossing a

319
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,440
street without looking both ways isn't a

320
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,240
sign of weakness it's a sign of strength

321
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,240
you oh my God

322
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,060
I couldn't walk oh my God and you know

323
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,279
there's no cars oh my God I feel you I

324
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,740
hear you and everything hold on this is

325
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,320
a big the confidence in the walking it's

326
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,660
style too and like something about

327
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,600
slightly being out of place because you

328
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,100
don't want to be too in place

329
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,320
you know if I if we're at the beach

330
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,880
right and there was no no hold on you're

331
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,740
jumping you need to say one everyone

332
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,120
needs to say one no I'm saying what I'm

333
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,440
saying is that's what it is it's like if

334
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,480
you're at the beach and some tribe

335
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
traveler walks by in just a bathing suit

336
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,200
you're gonna be like no that's because

337
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,440
that's like too obvious they try to

338
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,360
blend in but like not that much so

339
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,399
that's like a a bathing suit and maybe

340
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,560
like flip-flops holding a beach ball

341
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
that's more time very time travel so

342
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,560
it's like

343
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,260
too much I don't think the time

344
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,459
travelers I personally this is two this

345
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,740
is the second one

346
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,139
how to catch a time traveler I think the

347
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,060
second one is more of like a

348
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,279
I don't think they change as often as

349
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,680
you think like oh they're going to like

350
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,240
the beach so they get a beach towel a

351
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,220
Beach Blanket Beach shorts like all

352
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
those things I think it's one universal

353
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,660
it's like an outfit that could fit in

354
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,079
any scenario yes like a weird pattern

355
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,339
but like long and like not like you know

356
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,200
I feel like they'd wear like a very

357
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,480
specific article clothing that could

358
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,579
just fit in any scenario I got a really

359
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,720
good right like that the need from horn

360
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,820
here's who like you could use that for

361
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,500
everything not that in general every

362
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,639
time traveler is gonna have on and it's

363
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:37,440
a dead giveaway sunglasses no

like anything like they gotta know what

370
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,480
time it is they need to know where they

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,320
ended up oh my

372
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,459
[Music]

373
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,959
oh my God they have to be like oh 8 45

374
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,940
and then like but it's gonna be like

375
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,720
it's gonna be an old yes it's gonna be

376
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,820
like an old-timey Beach

377
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,800
we should do like a time travel triplet

378
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,060
prank on people don't say this because

379
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,220
they're gonna want it and we can't like

380
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,620
I can't orchestrate right now no in the

381
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,959
farm for our future I want to watch now

382
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,760
on my wrist I don't have a watch but I

383
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,260
want one now I like a vintage watch that

384
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,420
like makes it look it has to fit in

385
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,620
every era that you look like no not even

386
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,880
just like really old I feel like that'd

387
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,260
be the one dead giveaway they wear like

388
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,700
an old watch everywhere yeah that's what

389
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,079
I just said no because it wouldn't fit

390
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,959
in every hour I feel like a time

391
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,940
traveler

392
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,860
oh my God I need an old watch now I need

393
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,660
a vintage watch I need what I need to

394
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,220
look okay okay whatever dude but listen

395
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,540
wait but we're only on two I feel like

396
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,399
if it's I probably had a vintage watch

397
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,500
if they went to the Future it'd become a

398
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,899
future watch

399
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,820
an adaptable watch an adaptable watch

400
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,440
that's a good thing that's like the one

401
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,260
thing they want to keep like the same

402
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,000
yeah I feel like sunglasses are huge I

403
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,040
agree

404
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,440
I feel like a time traveler also another

405
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,180
thing I hate to say this I feel like

406
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,440
you'd be born actually I don't exist I

407
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,940
think you'd be born into like time

408
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,260
traveling like the world of it you know

409
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,820
what I mean yeah like your parents would

410
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,860
have to be Time Travelers and stuff and

411
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,540
I feel like it's kind of like you can't

412
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,800
have too many time travelers watching

413
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,300
this you can't have too much like you

414
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,339
and they travel back in time to erase

415
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,139
this video I feel like the time traveler

416
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,000
couldn't have like this is the third one

417
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,560
about a time traveler I feel like they

418
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,300
couldn't have that much uniqueness about

419
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,279
them yeah and I'm saying that in like a

420
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,079
way of like they couldn't have like

421
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,579
what's it called like a lot of freckles

422
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,079
on their face because that's kind of

423
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,579
obvious like they just like it's a

424
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,779
unique looking person like a time

425
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,519
traveler could never be one of those

426
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,839
people like a blue and brown eye no it

427
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,459
has because it's something that stands

428
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,940
out so much to you like it has to be

429
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,139
like a very basic looking like like you

430
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,540
just talk about like

431
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,100
a human being and that's what it is yeah

432
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,620
like anyone that looks like just like

433
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,199
very human like you're just you yeah

434
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,120
like but so like I dropped an ice cube

435
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,060
you're just that you know you can't have

436
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,579
too much going on for you you know yeah

437
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,680
like if you guys had a time machine what

438
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:00,620
would yours be but wait can we talk

439
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,300
about the three main things

440
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,339
hold on we have to go back we're gonna

441
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,959
talk about the amazing we have to just

442
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,760
say it in order walking this sort of

443
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,339
like the three ways you could find a

444
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,860
time traveler out of the ordinary space

445
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,540
no the three ways that you could find a

446
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,060
time traveler right in front of your

447
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,100
eyes go the pep in the step with no

448
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,040
hesitation

449
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,839
the watch the watch they have a watch on

450
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,079
at all times

451
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,959
and then slightly in the ordinary they

452
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,779
look very normal and basic yep the

453
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,699
fourth one was sunglasses sunglasses not

454
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,740
even no it's like they have the attire

455
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,959
that can fit in any situation and then

456
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,519
sunglasses okay

457
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,459
good

458
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,620
what would be your like the DeLorean in

459
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,240
Back to the Future she just wanted to go

460
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,519
back to the future so I brought that

461
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,480
girl into the lion tell us from Back to

462
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,459
the Future

463
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,699
do you know that Nick I don't care

464
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,740
what would be your time travel vessel go

465
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:05,819
mine would be a cup

466
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,339
now this is where I lose myself this is

467
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:11,699
where I lose my mind no that was my

468
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,980
final [ __ ] straw why

469
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,720
you have the option of any vessels okay

470
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,959
no you're right you're right she's a cop

471
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,240
you're right you're right a bike a bike

472
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,400
oh that's a good one I can see Matt on a

473
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,939
time travel too clunky they're too

474
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,939
clunky

475
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,080
it has to be like uh well I'm just

476
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,600
thinking you gotta find it you know if

477
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,220
you have to go back to the pilgrims

478
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,440
you're not gonna bring a bike you know

479
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,700
like what the [ __ ] is that that's like

480
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,700
oh oh I know next like a coin a coin yes

481
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,700
yes

482
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,679
next would be a coin I said that before

483
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,080
and not a staff because that wouldn't

484
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,660
fit I know hold on I know I'm always

485
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,620
talking about staffs yep a cane a longer

486
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,780
like a good hook no because

487
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,860
I changed mine no it'd be like a pocket

488
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:14,280
okay I changed mine oh my God I changed

489
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:18,000
mine no one asked yeah go ahead I care I

490
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,820
just like giving you [ __ ] go

491
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,179
a key

492
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,100
but the the lock part is the star at the

493
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,039
end and then the handle part is a moon

494
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,600
and then oh my God

495
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,820
not because then I think you're an alien

496
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,820
you gotta revisit that one okay star in

497
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,799
the end normal key okay yeah yeah Matt

498
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,539
what about you maybe it's star in the

499
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,059
clock

500
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:45,419
I have another question after I'm making

501
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,400
my watch yes that's a valid take I love

502
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,000
it great one or maybe like a ring I feel

503
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,679
like oh a ring yeah

504
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,720
or you just take the ring and you tap it

505
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,039
on the watch and like tap oh my God a

506
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
ring that you take off and it clicks

507
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,900
into the wall now retwist it I think I

508
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,539
think hold on

509
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,039
okay last question last question well

510
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,080
for me yes go for yeah for this video

511
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,179
last question what would be your time

512
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,400
traveler agent name super important

513
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,260

520
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,660
star with the clock on the key star time

521
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:34,140

Au calendar that is great

532
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,580

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,580
right now you need no middle name

534
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,780
