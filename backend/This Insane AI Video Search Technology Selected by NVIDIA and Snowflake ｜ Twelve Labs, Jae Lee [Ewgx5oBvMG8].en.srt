1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,839
if you try to accommodate all of the

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,480
advices that you get from your mentors

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,120
your company will most likely become

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,120
like an underwear company totally

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,160
different from what you wanted to build

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,440
having some fundamental like foundation

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,640
for yourself and for the company and be

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,560
able to say thank you for your advice

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,039
but no thank you right so having that

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,599
the gut to say no to someone that you

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,160
you respect as a Founder I think I grew

12
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,000
a lot hi yo my name is Jay I'm one of

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,040
the co-founders and CEO of 12 Labs 12

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Labs is an AI research and product

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,760
company based here in San Francisco and

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,079
so we're building video Foundation

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
models for developers and Enterprises

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,200
building video Centric product we

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
basically build humongous AI models that

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,800
can understand videos like humans and we

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,719
serve it to developers via apis that are

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,000
looking into building really powerful

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,320
semantic search or classification or

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,840
summarization into their product we

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,239
currently have a little over 20,000

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,199
developers that are actively using our

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,640
search API we have large creators of the

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,479
world adopting 12 Labs as well as uh

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,520
media entertainment and large Sports

30
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,520
organizations and law

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,520
enforcement so I was born in Soul I

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
spent about 10 years in Soul uh I had a

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,840
chance to move to the states I moved

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,880
when I was 11 so went through Elementary

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,119
and Middle School in Knoxville Tennessee

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,320
I was able to pick up a lot of the the

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,159
the culture and and and things like that

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,840
I was uh very interested in expanding my

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,159
perspective and uh exploring the new

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,280
world my first experience with software

41
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,960
engineering or at least coding was uh

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,079
met lab my uncle uh was actually getting

43
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,240
his PhD at the University of Tennessee

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,360
so I I see him kind of like plotting

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,840
this distribution graphs and things like

46
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,159
that and which made me curious what what

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,159
he was doing that's how I got into

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,840
playing around with like small data sets

49
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,680
and doing the same thing that he he was

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,079
doing because I wanted to be relevant

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,920
and I wanted to talk to him about a

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,399
bunch of things he probably thought what

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,079
I was doing was pretty cute which

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,399
sparked my interest in learning more

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,920
about how do we capture all this data

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,080
and be able to create a system that can

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,959
really understand the distributions of

58
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,440
the things of the world and it just kind

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,440
of felt like if you had the

60
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,680
understanding of that it gives you power

61
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,760
predict anything and I went to Berkeley

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,239
for college and study computer science

63
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,480
so I really geeked out on AI and and

64
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,200
software engineering um so spent about

65
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,280
15 years uh in the United States um so

66
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,400
half of my life in Soul and in the

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,440
states I was dra Ed into uh this

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,440
organization called Korean cyber command

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,599
where like-minded people were already

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,040
there um with Incredible knowledge and

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,840
software engineering and and and AI I

72
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,120
joke about it you know I served the

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
country with keyboards rather than than

74
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,000
than a rifle I was really fortunate to

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,959
have met my Chief Architect SJ and then

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,239
Aiden kind of also joined in US you I

77
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,879
still clearly remember Aiden with this

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,840
buzz cut coming in from from boot camp

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,840
but from day one uh we knew we had this

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,959
common interest in Ai and what can we do

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,000
as a as a young scientist really like

82
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,040
push the frontier of AI development and

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,440
we've spent a lot of times reading

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,720
papers discussing arguing and it turned

85
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,879
out there were two clear paths uh one

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,879
was after military we go personal career

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,440
in Academia go become a professor or

88
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,879
start something of our own and looking

89
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,080
back what we realized is that we were

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,319
spending so much time together and

91
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,319
Military is this really special setting

92
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,799
where you know you're basically jamming

93
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,080
in 50 to 100 12 year olds right with

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
testosterones and what we thought was

95
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,439
you know if we're having this much fun

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
in military imagine what we can do when

97
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,959
we go out so it was pretty clear to us

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
that we're going to start I think we've

99
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,200
spent about year and a half really

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,760
thinking about what is the next Frontier

101
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,360
for AI and how can we contribute to

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,040
pushing that boundary there's this

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,760
seminal paper called attention is all

104
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,280
you need which some people call it the

105
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,400
Transformer paper which is making a lot

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,519
of impact now but when it was published

107
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,680
in 2017 at least for text and

108
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,879
image-based you know Foundation models

109
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,000
probably Capital was going to be a mode

110
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,440
whoever raises most amount of money what

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,359
we realized was there's still a lot of

112
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,759
unexplored research areas for multimodal

113
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,880
video understanding there rather than

114
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,960
capital is probably going to be really

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,759
passionate smart but also slightly dumb

116
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,759
people that's like dumb enough to start

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,720
it will have really good chance of

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,199
succeeding and also we've realized that

119
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,199
with the explosion of that video and and

120
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,120
other complex multimedia data is going

121
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,199
to be the infrastructural data for the

122
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,639
internet and we realized that probably

123
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,759
developers and Enterprises need

124
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,120
something better than object detection

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,440
or or transcription to make sense of all

126
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,400
all this video data that the humanity is

127
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,240
creating so it was like a no-brainer to

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,560
start building for video understanding

129
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,199
the model that 12 Labs is building it's

130
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,240
basically trying to map human language

131
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,720
into whatever that's happening in video

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
content so if you can map precise human

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,680
language to whatever that's happening

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
within video content that gives you this

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,080
emergence capabilities like being able

136
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,759
to search for things really well or

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,039
being able to classify things or

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,960
summarize you know we didn't All Join

139
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,479
the Korean cyber command at the same

140
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,759
time so SJ was already like 6 months

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,759
ahead of me and then Aiden was 6 months

142
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,639
behind so like okay we we decided we're

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,520
going to we're going to start this

144
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,759
company but then SJ is like leaving like

145
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,479
next year and then I'm leaving the year

146
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,280
after and then Aiden's like 6 months

147
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,759
after so how do we do it so it was

148
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,960
genuinely very scary so we had our ideas

149
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,520
I remember SJ was discharged on Thursday

150
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
and he came back to the military base

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,759
Saturday of that week with our laptops

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,000
and he took us out in front of our

153
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,520
military base there was a bagel shop

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,039
called Las vagel and that was like our

155
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,280
office where SJ would bring all of our

156
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,759
laptops and we would do our research and

157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,639
and do some little little bit of

158
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,319
prototyping and we did that for 6 months

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,600
and then I got this charge and I did the

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,080
whole laptop carrying and and picking

161
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,319
out Aiden so we did that for like a good

162
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,120
like year so that everyone is out and

163
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,280
then we had a bunch of friends that were

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,479
working in Ai and crypto and blockchain

165
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,440
and and and web 3 was just booming and

166
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,039
we had a mutual friend like the founders

167
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,840
had a mutual friend that had like a

168
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,520
really nice office in Soul and he was

169
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,280
like oh you guys can come in and and use

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,240
our office space uh so that's what we

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,080
did and then after like 3 weeks that

172
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,440
company went bankrupt and then really

173
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,360
scary like people started coming in and

174
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,520
and we had like our desktops and our

175
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,400
gpus all set up there and we got really

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
scared so we brought everything back out

177
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,039
and we found like really tiny tiny

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,639
office probably like a size of a

179
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,199
dressing room uh that's where like all

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,039
five of us kind of spent uh the next 6

181
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,280
months uh before uh we raised our proper

182
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,560
seat ground looking back if we were to

183
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,240
do it again I don't know it we'll be

184
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,800
able to do it but some people say

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
ignorance is bliss and I think we were

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,479
just like really naive and just really

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,560
excited about building this company and

188
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,199
I guess not knowing what was ahead um

189
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,520
allowed us to kind of do what we

190
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,639
did hi all I'm J from EO I have a quick

thanks to hopspot for sponsoring our

217
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,919
video now back to the

218
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,199
video when we first started a company

219
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,479
and we hired our first employees they

220
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,440
had hard time explaining what 12 Labs

221
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,759
does to their parents really new thing

222
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,360
what is foundation model what is video

223
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,199
understanding It's A New Concept that's

224
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,159
hard to understand for I guess uh people

225
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,319
that are not in the space nowadays

226
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,080
people talk about the foundation layer

227
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,159
the tooling layer and the application

228
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,320
layer it all everyone's very familiar uh

229
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,800
when we started 12 Labs I think

230
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,760
technologically it made total sense we

231
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,080
knew it was going to happen but what was

232
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,600
uncertain about it was Will Market

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,880
accept but knowing that we are at the

234
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,720
verge of breakthrough in building an AI

235
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,080
that can at least you know get to

236
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,200
certain level of human understanding of

237
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,040
videos so we were betting on Market's

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
acceptance of foundation models the

239
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,640
founders are pretty pretty much broke

240
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,839
right because we spent 2 years at at

241
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,440
military and I think we had

242
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,399
$22,000 uh to start with so barely

243
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,720
barely enough to do anything but

244
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,680
figuring out what was going to be

245
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,720
impactful that we can do given our

246
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,000
current resources that'll put us in the

247
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,920
map or at least you know let the world

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,279
know that what we're doing is relevant

249
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,120
so our tactic here was okay we're going

250
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,560
to talk to a bunch of customers and

251
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,640
there were early Believers in 12 Labs

252
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,560
who took our apis and built awesome

253
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,480
things with us but we needed more more

254
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,079
exposure basically so as a team we've

255
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,040
decided uh to participate in icb's its

256
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,480
International Conference in computer

257
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,720
vision they're putting this like awesome

258
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
competition for video understandings so

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,760
we talked to Aiden we have nothing to

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,320
lose and only to gain the team was

261
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,560
extremely supportive of of Aiden

262
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,640
spearheading that effort with the team

263
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,760
all I can do to support is you know

264
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,880
there was some ideas and and directional

265
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,920
kind of feedback that I gave to Aiden

266
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,560
but we needed compute and we needed

267
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,600
determination to put some serious cash

268
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,320
behind and back then for 12 laps like

269
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,000
$200,000 in in compute was was a lot of

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,920
money for us right so and just thinking

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,600
that okay we're going to blow through

272
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,160
$200,000 in 10 days in compute was

273
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,200
really scary but the team was able to

274
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,519
use that Capital that that precious

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
capital and build something incredible

276
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,360
helped us win the competition um so I

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
think the important thing is if you're

278
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,279
building something really impact full

279
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,079
and you think that it's going to

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,639
significantly change the industry that

281
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,959
you're in there will always be someone

282
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,800
that has very similar thesis it's just a

283
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,560
matter of how do you get yourself out

284
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,880
there how do you let the people know

285
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,040
that you you you exist for us that was

286
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,720
the competition after winning the

287
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,040
competition companies like index

288
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,880
Ventures and radical Ventures had very

289
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,120
strong thesis around multimodal AI the

290
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,680
next idea would be what's next and video

291
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,680
happens to be the most relatable

292
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,000
multimodal data these amazing companies

293
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,680
actually came in inbound and so they

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,040
reached out to us and we started jamming

295
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,040
the conversations turned into next

296
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,519
conversation and then we talked about

297
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,720
technology and and it just happened very

298
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,680
serendipitously right the first pitch

299
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,160
deck I was in Soul and and my first uh

300
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,079
call with index Ventures was at like I

301
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,560
it was like 3:30 a.m. Soul time and we

302
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,440
didn't have pitch deck and we just felt

303
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,920
like hm this is our first meeting and we

304
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
we we knew nothing about fundraising

305
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,600
then we didn't even know this was going

306
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,440
to be like a friendly introduction but I

307
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,880
just kind of felt the need to like oh we

308
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,839
don't have pitch Tech we need to build

309
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,600
one so I remember staying up till like

310
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
3:00 a.m. building it I think the

311
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,760
storyline was like quite simple we

312
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
didn't have much to much to show for it

313
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,720
the idea was hey the problem that we're

314
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,720
solving is massive 80% of the world's

315
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,079
data is in video and there's no adequate

316
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,920
solution out there or technology out

317
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,680
there for developers and Enterprises to

318
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
make sense of it all that is the market

319
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,639
that we're we're tackling we want to

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,480
index all of that like 80% of the

321
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,200
world's data and this is the technology

322
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,240
underlying research work that we've done

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,160
and then that was it VC's asked a lot of

324
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,040
hard questions the most memorable one if

325
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,320
I bring you Tik Tok as a customer and

326
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,079
they want to index like billion hours of

327
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,399
content how long does it take and I

328
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,800
think we were we were thinking about

329
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,560
maybe like a million hours going to take

330
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,480
like 10 years right that's when we

331
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,560
realize we should never be comfortable

332
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,839
of with what we've built this whole new

333
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,560
incredibly large world out there you

334
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,560
know that maybe some people are

335
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,360
impressed with our system being able to

336
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,240
index like a million hour but there's

337
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,320
others that are thinking about billion

338
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,120
10 billion 100 billion hours and that

339
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,880
was like a really challenging question

340
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,600
because like what we said during our

341
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,320
pitches we want to index all of the

342
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,360
world's videos and that question kind of

343
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,279
made me stun and I think about all of

344
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
the technical issues that that we had at

345
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,440
the time you probably find it like funny

346
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,040
right I was trying to give my best

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,040
answer as a Founder in like so the

348
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,480
company has raised about $30 million uh

349
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,480
in seed

350
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,800
funding my name is so young I'm one of

351
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,519
the co-founders of 12 lots and I

352
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,720
currently lead our business development

353
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,120
and go to market we had a customer who

354
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,800
was paying for our product um but they

355
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,600
weren't actually using it um but we had

356
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,920
gone through a lot of work to actually

357
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,959
get them as a customer through a lot of

358
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,839
sales and kind of relationship building

359
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
and so on but I think they were they

360
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,040
know were extremely early and we had

361
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
almost pushed the sales to happen and I

362
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,079
think what we learned from that

363
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,839
experience was we have to optimize even

364
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,000
early on it might have been better for

365
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,560
us to not actually make the sale because

366
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,279
the customer probably wasn't ready they

367
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,199
didn't have the passion or the

368
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,480
Innovative drive that our other

369
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,560
customers had had but we were optimizing

370
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,199
for kind of hearing the yes we tried so

371
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,639
hard to make that no into a yes and we

372
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,240
had succeeded but at the at the end I

373
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,480
think it turned out that we probably

374
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,040
should have kept it out of no and

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,839
focused on all the other customers where

376
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,839
the yes was very more clear and they had

377
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,759
a very clear vision of how they can you

378
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
know build their new experiences with

379
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,639
the the technology and especially for

380
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,240
earlier products and earlier

381
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,600
Technologies where resources are limited

382
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,600
and you want to you know build for your

383
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,759
Mo best customers and the innovators in

384
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,480
every field uh you should probably start

385
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,079
to optimize for hearing the no uh then

386
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,560
the yes because that will help you find

387
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,320
the right direction faster we quickly I

388
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,160
think we learned through trial and error

389
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,959
that the types of companies that we need

390
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,839
to early customers that we need to find

391
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,000
and work with are true innovators in

392
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,600
their field uh whether they come from

393
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,120
like the content creation space law

394
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,519
enforcement space e-learning and so on

395
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,320
you know we've had instances of trying

396
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,399
to oversell we were going through sales

397
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,120
you know sales 101 books or like sales

398
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,440
methodologies and we were trying to

399
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,040
pitch to the customer hey here's the use

400
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,839
case you could build out with our you

401
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,399
know with our technology you know we'll

402
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,720
improve your Roi by x% with our

403
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,680
technology and we did make some sales

404
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,279
from those but I don't think it was

405
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,920
something that we probably should have

406
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,399
you know spent so much time on doing

407
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
because if you find the right customer

408
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,320
who's Innovative you don't need to

409
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,800
explain anything to them you show them

410
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,480
uh a use case based demo of you know for

411
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,720
us it would be and we we would index uh

412
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,639
some videos that resemble the customers

413
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,839
and then we show them how you can search

414
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,120
or you can generate text very easily

415
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,680
like a like just like a person would um

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
had they been watching the video they

417
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,560
can draw out the full map of okay this

418
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,720
is what I want to provide to my

419
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,759
customers or my users uh this is a

420
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,519
technology that you have and I can and

421
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,079
they can you know fill that Gap in

422
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,959
pretty easily and they know already uh

423
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,000
what the return on that or what the

424
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,279
opportunity of that experience would be

425
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,079
for them for the kind of really large

426
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,519
high-profile customers that we have

427
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,959
right now it was all the same process we

428
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,759
actually learned all of these from the

429
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,120
customers because they had you know

430
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,800
seeing our demo and seeing the early

431
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,800
hints of the technology uh they were

432
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,639
able to teach us about how they could

433
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,160
utilize the technology and even today

434
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,079
it's not just a single use case that

435
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,440
they want to power uh they come to us

436
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,880
with four or five different ideas of how

437
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,399
you know the technology can impact

438
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,920
different units different business units

439
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
um and different you know optimize

440
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,880
different workflows or build new

441
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,399
experiences I think we we make stupid

442
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,839
mistakes probably every day the one that

443
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,959
I regret the most is we knew we had like

444
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,120
this conviction around building a

445
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,120
foundation model but then we didn't have

446
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,040
any data point as to how do you build

447
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,480
that company and I think I blindingly

448
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,959
kind of believe that the startup montra

449
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,959
like identifying a narrow problem and

450
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,120
building a very narrow solution for it I

451
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,959
think we've spent a lot of early days

452
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,880
thinking about okay if we have this

453
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,160
really powerful AI that can understand

454
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,000
videos what do we do with it and we know

455
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,440
we know from the from the gecko that we

456
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
wanted to servey to developers and

457
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,800
Enterprises but I think you know we've

458
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,360
had mentors and and and and other

459
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,639
Founders like oh you should build Tik

460
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,800
Tok 2.0 or you should build like YouTube

461
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,919
2.0 or you should build that and I think

462
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,919
we've spent a lot of time thinking okay

463
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,199
maybe like Tik Tok 2.0 makes sense or

464
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,439
maybe like gong 2.0 like sales call

465
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,160
analysis but that didn't really like

466
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,959
excite us because we knew like we're

467
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,919
good at building the infrastructure and

468
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,439
and helping developers build the next

469
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,760
thing and that's probably the stupidest

470
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,919
thing that we've done it's like spending

471
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,120
time on thinking about things that we're

472
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,440
not excited about as a founder and see

473
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,520
it's really hard to get distracted if

474
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
you're a firsttime founder or a young

475
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,400
founder your mentor's advice means a lot

476
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,320
to you but having like your own

477
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,120
grounding having your own also re like

478
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,200
relying a little bit on your own gut

479
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,760
feeling is very important because what

480
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,880
we've realized if you try to accommodate

481
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,919
all of the advices that you get from

482
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,679
your mentors your company will most

483
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
likely become like an underwear company

484
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,919
totally different from what you wanted

485
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,360
to build so my key takeaway is having

486
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,559
some fundamental like foundation for

487
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,919
yourself and for the company and be able

488
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,919
to say thank you for your advice but no

489
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,240
thank you right so having that the gut

490
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,600
to say no to someone that you you

491
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,799
respect as a Founder I think I grew a

492
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,320
lot right 12 Labs has multi-year Compu

493
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,240
partnership with Oracle Cloud

494
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,919
infrastructure where we get all of the

495
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,600
uh state-of-the-art and media chips and

496
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,840
Oracle had put together uh this small

497
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,039
event for their key partners that are

498
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,320
building Foundation models for and Aiden

499
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,000
and I had chance to meet with Jensen

500
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,480
because Jensen was at that event and we

501
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,240
had I think 5 to 10 minutes to talk

502
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,080
about 12 laps and I think it seems like

503
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,400
he had he has a special uh place in his

504
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,760
heart about computer vision and video

505
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,919
understanding is you know that was one

506
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,039
of the first use cases that Nvidia chips

507
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,960
powered so we we got to uh meet with

508
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,840
like Nvidia folks from that event and

509
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,640
then 12 laps was featured in nvidia's

510
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,840
2023 GTC and I think that kind of

511
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,559
sparked other people from Nvidia to be

512
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,840
interested in 12 labs and the mvidia

513
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,559
Venture team reached out to us it was

514
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,640
quite casual we were talking about 12

515
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,520
labs and the future that we're drawing

516
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
and the future of multimodal video

517
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,520
understanding and I think the Venture

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,919
team also had an idea of how Nvidia and

519
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
12 laps can partner up more than just

520
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,960
Financial investment but also think

521
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,280
about really robust product partnership

522
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,679
from then on what 12 leps is doing and

523
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,120
what Nvidia want in vision and video

524
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,960
understanding was just like a perfect

525
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,799
match it happen quite uh naturally from

526
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
from conversing our our technology our

527
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,760
road map and and mvidia future in terms

528
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,679
of like producing really powerful uh

529
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,280
chips for Edge devices uh for smart

530
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,880
cities right so there's that natural fit

531
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,880
of two companies product really creating

532
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,440
Synergy nowadays I am focusing mostly on

533
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,360
hiring so I think 12 Labs is group of

534
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,280
great people I spend a lot of time

535
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,280
meeting great people I want to be able

536
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,640
to recognize greatness when he or she

537
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,720
comes in good Engineers or even like

538
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,480
just good people in general have this

539
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,679
core values I would go uh near their

540
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,840
places and get together at a cafe and we

541
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,159
would speak for 3 4 hours my way of

542
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,919
deciding whether this person is a good

543
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,000
fit for 12 laps is like I am able to

544
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,720
learn from their core values everyone's

545
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,799
really good at coding nowadays but great

546
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,679
Engineers can apply their core values

547
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:32,400
and their skill set and is able to talk

548

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,440
you see our interfaces evolving the best

552
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,360
some of the best Engineers are not the

553
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
best coder but having that perspective

554
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,200
really strong perspective and and

555
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,280
groundedness is very important and and I

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,960
infrastructures for all of the

560
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,840
businesses and developers that are

561
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,320
working with video data we want to enter

562
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:10,039
into uh streaming as well so real- time

563
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,919
uh video data and uh really become a

564
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,660
visual cortex for modern video

565
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:19,410
