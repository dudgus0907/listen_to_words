nugget

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,360

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,000
eBay you know how like they do the eBay

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,500
things in general gorilla shaped Cheetos

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,660
I think that has more value because

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,480
you've held it in your hand than it does

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,819

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,920

Australia and kill all the kangaroo I

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,780
think what

74
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,120
I think we should all go around a circle

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,040
saying our favorite thing about each

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,480

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,700

78
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm doing that

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,140

sibling and Snapple

312
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,320
don't do that

313
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,779
who's most likely to make a stupid

314
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,500
decision that turns into 20 minutes of

315
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:09,360
constant regret Chris I have no regrets

316
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,060
actually she's like a little [ __ ] kid

317
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,620

like a little kid

321
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:26,240
oh man shut up yeah and he argues at me

322
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,240
by saying you physically touched me

323
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:33,199
cry themselves to sleep me I always get

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,199

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,639
call me that lean too far back on a

330
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,740
chair and fall over I did that yesterday

331
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,199
Matt literally almost fell into an

332
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,480
entire TV console yesterday yeah that

333
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:04,019
would have been so funny post a 2017

334
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,000
meme on their story Matt

335
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,040
and Nick I feel like Matt's like a meme

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,199
Lord okay you see the one I sent you

337
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,820
guys today yeah yeah that [ __ ] was so

338
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,339
funny actually I could have said

339
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,399
anything what is that my heebies are GB

340
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,980
oh my GBS are GB who's most likely to

341
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,160
get mad for absolutely anything Nick

342
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,680
Chris Nick you just punched a Snapple

343
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,660
out of because you [ __ ] grasped my

344
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,459
throat and shut my mouth who's most

345
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,940
likely to forget a person's name me

346
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,740
Chris Chris actually calls the most

347
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,420
amount of people the wrong thing there

348
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,820
and he's just rolled with it we're like

349
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,100
I can tell you at least three people

350
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,839
that have fake names that every single

351
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,820
person we're friends with also knows

352
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,759
their fake name because how often Chris

353
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,800
uses the wrong name correct jump in a

354
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,440
Sea full of sharks

355
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,420

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,240
right Matt Wood

357
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,639
because he's just a wild card

358
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,019
one thing about Matt is uh you never

359
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,660
know what to expect someone said who's

360
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:07,020
most likely to scream out of nowhere

361
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:10,030
Chris yeah invent a new recipe me

362
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:14,699
