did it it was like Transformer [ __ ] you

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,759
know when they like I need Chopsticks

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,920
and like the Beats I was playing as the

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,739
person I've actually never seen a single

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,599
Transformers movie no way so I feel like

53
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,520
I did I was just like eight who's most

54
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,340
likely to be a gentle parent

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,260
not me I'm sorry I don't think I'd

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,300
actually like I feel like I feel like

57
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,640
it's hard to say gentle because gentle

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,319
means like gentle but the opposite one I

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,260
think it was like use force and I don't

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,819
think any of us would like use Force I

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,680
feel like it's more rough who's the

62
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,840
rough parent I want to skip this

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,580

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,959

82
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,780

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,580
it I grabbed you Nick hold on it's weird

84
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm just curious why you were playing

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,060
with his used dental floss because I

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,959
didn't see it was floss I have dark

87
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,239
sunglasses on but and then I saw like

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,459
the line the white squiggle on this

89
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,379
thing and I [ __ ] just grabbed it

90
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,900
because I thought it was lint not lint

91
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,580
no [ __ ] I just figured that out no need

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,260
to be rude so yeah what was the multiple

93
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,120
times thing has he done it yes he did it

94
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,799
earlier no earlier today he floss with

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,239
like a really long piece of [ __ ] and he

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,500
starts and he picks up and starts using

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,500
it and I smacked it out of his hand

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,140
and then we both put our flocks down and

99
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,700
then I went to pick mine back up and

100
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,019
accidentally picked up his it's really

101
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,640
not that big of a deal you're making it

102
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,140
seem like I like really Crave Your floss

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
to be honest I don't give a [ __ ] about

104
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,620
your floss well I think it's all due

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,879
respect your floss means nothing to me I

106
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,200
thought you were dirty and had a piece

107
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,299
of lint on there well maybe you should I

108
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,120
try to read it I tried to be a kind

109
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,340
brother remove your lid and you were all

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
dramatic about it go ahead no I was

111
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,120
gonna say floss and correct you but you

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,979
but I thought it was if you're gonna

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,299
like do all this make sure you keep your

114
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,280
own in line then

115
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,079
If You're Gonna Keep My floss in I've

116
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,120
never seen somebody reuse floss like

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,100
that either floss is actually they

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,720
actually tell you to reuse it when you

119
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,100
buy the little dinosaur things they're

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,180
like oh you can actually use it more

121
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,919
than once if you leave it on your

122
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,199
counter and I literally just saw the

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,460
realization of stupidity you know you

124
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,740
did it because you literally were like

125
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,259
oh yeah nobody definitely uses they

126
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,080
literally [ __ ] tell you you can hurt

127
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,180
me I was on your side but that I really

128
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,680
don't they you dude I've been to the

129
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,240
dentist where you used the dinosaur

130
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,919
thing and you're like oh you know you

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,400
yeah

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,340
totally a okay to rinse it off and use

134
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
it the next day that's totally hygienic

135
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,639
completely perfect health if you do that

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,380
like it's not the dinosaur one simple

137
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,479

138
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,479

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,560
Chris is like back will hurt and he'll

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
like Google it and be like I have cancer

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,940
and that's not true that is true no that

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
does happen Chris Googles it and then

187
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,000
thinks he's like I have like six months

188
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
left to live no because I just really

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,500
think that I'm in poor health so when I

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,240
have like chest pains I instantly think

191
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,639
I'm having a hard aneurysm yeah like

192
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,380
Chris his he's more severe okay I feel

193
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,419
like it's it's both of you in a sense

194
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,400
where it's like Chris one he has one

195
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,960
major one every like seven to eight

196
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,180
months but you're just ripping them

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,180
ripping off allergies out of nowhere

198
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,759
yeah okay so no one but you more

199
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,020
anyone but you anyone but me Matt you

200
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
self-rescribe yourself with everything

201
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,099
in the book

202
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,539
it's likely to disappear for a full year

203
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,780
and then just like make some big return

204
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,580
this what no that's like you're making

205
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,319
that up who's most likely done with this

206
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,539
floss well if it says a year then that

207
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,160
obviously entails that it's not gonna be

208
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,440
more than that you're gonna hit me that

209
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,699
was like minimum

210
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,259
like who most likely to disappear for a

211
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,360
year minimum like who's most likely they

212
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,979
just disappear for a year oh I can't eat

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,400
with these are never ever said like oh

214
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,259
stated like Graham okay fine

215
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,460
you shut up I like your chicken

216
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,199
[ __ ] I like your hat

217
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,479
I appreciate that I was gonna try and

218
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,220
get somewhere but

219
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,780
who's most likely to disappear for a

220
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,780
year

221
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:11,460
I feel like it's Nick

222
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:15,620
you're a traitor oh my God

223
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,620
huh your loyalty to the team

224
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,460
scoffs ominous music plays as the

225
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,460
characters Fade Into the distance

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
did

227
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,599
that's actually a good point when I just

228
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,740
said I want to tell the viewers about a

229
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,240
story okay

230
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,820
my head's warm as a chicken's caboodle

231
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,880
right now okay what were you gonna say

232
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,800
caboodle yeah what's your story the

233
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,060
other day me and Matt were walking down

234
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,640
the street and it was like really sunny

235
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,020
out and he goes seems like Summer's

236
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,120
right around the corner

237
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,100
and I just thought it was so like all of

238
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,160
us like just so

239
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,500
terrible story anyway that was a story

240
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,779
that was the big story okay we can

241
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,980
definitely move past that quickly I

242
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,300
don't know when you narrate what you're

243
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,980
doing in life it makes you feel like

244
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,300
you're appreciating a lot more I think

245
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,320
you don't narrow it what you're doing I

246
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,240
think you need to narrow it what someone

247
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,100
else is doing

248
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,480
that just totally was the opposite of

249
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,000
what I just said

250
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,080
yeah I agree because I was disagreeing

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
with him and he goes you're Satan

252
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,480
opposite of what I said you look like a

253
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,480
[ __ ]

254
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:27,240

I said Matt see y'all that was a

302
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,260
question mark clearly no there wasn't

303
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,899

304
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,700
about you yo just set me up to look like

305
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,079
an idiot because you literally said oh

Matt not Chris

307
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,820
no Chris it was mad the way you said it

308
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,860
Chris it was the way you said it was

309
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,720
literally it was the way you smacked us

310
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,920

311
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,920

embarrassment shut up I'm gonna place my

314
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,019
hat back to my forehead and never do

00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,240
some foul [ __ ] like that again

316
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:01,860
use these because I feel like who's most

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,620
likely to [ __ ] dude I don't even

318
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,540
remember the question Matt Chris no

319
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,640
that's what I just had something to make

320
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,399

321
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,760
okay I'll play it back do you want me to

322
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,760

323
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,019
I will if you you listen practice back

324
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,200
on

325
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,760
listen you say listen you say how the

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,500
story went I'll say how the story went

327
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,060
and then we'll put up a [ __ ] poll and

328
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,640
see who

329
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,440
is more accurate

330
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,140
go

331
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,660
okay I'll go first Matt said who's most

332
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,700
likely a good decision

333
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,860
you're so weird yeah good decision to go

334
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,660
first who's most likely as he places his

335
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,240
sunglasses back to his forehand like

336
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,760
whatever let it die who's most likely to

337
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,360
talk in their sleep Matt

338
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,360
Chris

339
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,240
and I looked at you like who's most

340
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,240
likely to talk in their sleep Matt Chris

341
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,399
that's what I heard I still agree with

342
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,620
you either way I don't care I wasn't

343
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,880
fully listening anyway God I'm getting

344
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,399
hot

345
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,040
maybe take the [ __ ] hat off and not

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,779
the sunglasses guess what I can't why

347
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,000
because I wanted to wash my hair today

348
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,980
because it's all a mess I get in the

349
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,740
shower turn it all the way to the

350
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,740
[ __ ] Edge literally all the way 180

351
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,740
360.

352
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,940
15 seconds later

353
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,740
call me a sinner if I wash my hair with

354
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,860
cold water it's most likely to shave

355
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,200
their heads I want to shave my head

356
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,320
I do too kinda so let's do it but then

357
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,459
I'm just like uh is there too oh is

358
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,079
there too much forehead there to show

359
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,760
that to me I feel like we should really

360
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,860
scare the fans and take a month-long

361
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,420
Hiatus and completely change what don't

362
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,820
use big water

363
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,680
a month long like disappearance

364
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,139
disappearance and then come back it's my

365
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,540
forehead what is Chris Hiatus is the

366
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,279
same thing I literally taught you like

367
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,959
you know when you write in a book before

368
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,660
it's like the first yeah but isn't too

369
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,579

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,560
shave my ass yeah I don't give a [ __ ]

371
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,800
about your hold on what

372
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,880
like when you're writing an a page isn't

373
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,420
like the first thing you write your

374
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,440
hiatus

375
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,440
[Music]

376
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,920
I think it'd be really funny to scare

377
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,600
the fans and take a month-long break and

378
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,000
not have them see it coming like a

379
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,740
random point and then completely change

380
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
her and alter our appearance as much as

381
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,800
possible and then also our parents

382
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,100
[ __ ] turn your ears on I thought

383
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,959
you said alter our parents

384
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,459
no that's my big stupid thing they don't

385
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,860
even post themselves we could obviously

386
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:05,160
just alter our parents yeah you're funny

387
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,800
you're not who's most likely to eat

388
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,720
someone eat someone's leftovers without

389
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,459
with with knowing that it's somebody

390
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,440
else's and they have intent to going

391
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,240
back and eating it not even looking at

392
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,680

Nick's most likely to want to join the

444
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,699
FBI because he thinks he can be all

445
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,679

situations that really were learning

476
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,820
experiences Chris everything in your

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,580
life is positive if it's in the past

478
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,860
because it built you to who you are oh

479
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,080
but I'm so happy it's the past yeah

480

itching yourself

I can't film in the summer because I get

506
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,240
so hot and we can't turn the AC out I

507
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,720
heard myself echo when I hit that D I

508
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,720
said hat

509
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,000
good great okay no but what I'm saying

510
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,620
is I think Matt would walk in you in the

511
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,539
bathroom just because he's a door opener

512
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,520
and like leaves it open like he often

513
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,900
leaves my bedroom doors open so I feel

514
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,020
like that kind of correlates with like a

515
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,020
bathroom

516
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,539
quadruple quadruple quadruple knock when

517
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,400
I go anywhere I agree hello

518
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:14,100
it's really awkward when you just walk

519
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,600
in on somebody taking care of business

520
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,700
you act like this is like an everyday

521
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,240
occurrence so I walked in if I was

522
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,980
taking a [ __ ] like all gross and you

523
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,500
walked in just how defeated do you feel

524
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,720
like we're both embarrassed yeah yeah so

525
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,640
you just ruin it for the like the person

526
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,960
on the toilet can't get up

527
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,360
yeah they should have locked the door

528
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,640
though what if it had no lock it's your

529
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,179
fault it is that's true be the knocker

530
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,960
don't not knock I agree don't be nervous

531
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:45,299

532
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,400
