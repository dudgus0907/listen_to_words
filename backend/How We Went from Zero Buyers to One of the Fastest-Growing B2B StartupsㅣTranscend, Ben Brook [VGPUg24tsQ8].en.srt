1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,439
throw out a big number, see what

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,799
happens. If somebody bulks at it and

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,080
says that's way too high, you know,

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,520
you've at least done the right thing and

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,160
figured out what the top of the market

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,840
might be. Most founders are shocked at

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,440
the market uh will pay for their

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,440
product. And especially if you're a

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,080
first-time founder, you almost feel like

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,640
guilty or greedy asking for certain

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,279
numbers, but ultimately for pricing, you

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
really have to understand the business

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,160
value that a company is getting by using

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,160
your product.

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,719
So, I'm Ben Brookke. I'm the co-founder

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
and CEO of Transcend. We are a data

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,680
privacy infrastructure company. We help

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,840
other businesses uh encode privacy rules

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,320
across all of their technology. We're

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
helping them comply with privacy laws

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,480
and really adopting the spirit of

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,320
privacy and giving consumers far better

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,840
control over their personal data. We're

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,559
backed by uh Excel Index. We're now a

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,559
series B startup.

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,520
I think the biggest challenge for us um

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,240
like many founders were finding that

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
first product market fit. As a founder

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,520
in the weeds, you're like so excited

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520
about this thing and you think like

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,960
we've got it. This is going to land.

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
People are going to love it. Nobody

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,200
wants to buy it. And then like really

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,759
kind of learning to trust the data and

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,000
test understand what the customer really

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,840
needs. like you can't stress enough when

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
you're building a product to like really

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,280
understand your customer. What we ended

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,200
up doing was we found a few early

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
customers. We basically just said like

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
what if we just automated this for you?

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
We'll be like your extended privacy

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
engineering team. Let us build the

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,759
solution and kind of just like help us

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,600
understand every aspect of it. It was

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
actually a fairly consultative

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,640
engagement with the first two or three

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
customers and we made sure that like

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
they were aligned to the fact that yes

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,960
we are going to build a product here but

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
that was how we approached it. So

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
especially when it's in I think like a

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
little bit more toward like the

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,840
enterprise software motion I think

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,759
that's like absolutely a path you can

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,479
take where you just kind of let

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,399
customers vent their problems and offer

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,879
to just find a way to fix them. As for

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,599
scaling from you know 10 to 100

60
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,000
customers in enterprise this is when you

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,760
need to have your first sellers.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,200
Typically, you can do founderled sales

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,160
for the first call it 20, 30 customers,

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,520
but not only should you start handing

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,599
that off, but also like it's an

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
important part of proving that you're

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
able to scale the business past yourself

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,879
who knows every nook and cranny of the

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
product and you've been thinking about

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,720
this problem for like, you know, 5 years

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,319
or whatever. To be able to have a seller

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,319
become successful in selling your

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,280
product is an important first milestone.

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,680
And we we really spent the time to find

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
that right sort of first seller. And the

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
first seller is completely different

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
from like the latest stage seller where

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,720
they're super creative. They kind of do

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,040
every sales role alone which includes

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,200
generating pipeline, you know, actually

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,879
running the deal with as an account

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,280
executive would and then even a lot of

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,760
like sales engineering in some cases

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,959
probably contracting all of the sort of

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,640
the full endto-end sales process. And we

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,159
found somebody who's just incredible at

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,680
this. I I really believe there's nothing

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,840
more important than like finding the

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,080
best hire. If you need to slow down to

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,319
get it right, it's 100% worth it. And

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,879
then after that, depending on what your

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,239
sort of AR is at around 100 customers,

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,560
you either need to scale your sales team

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
or you probably like if it's way up

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
market, you probably already have. But

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,879
in any case, being able to scale a sales

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
team really is about if you don't have a

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
sales background, like you should find a

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,840
sales leader. It is such a huge subject

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
with so much expertise that it is one of

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
the things where you just you need to

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,440
find a great leader who can do all of

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
the right pieces of like building

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,120
playbooks, breaking out the sales

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,200
process with like uh sales development

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
representatives, account executives,

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
sales engineering, revenue operations

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
and so forth. There's a whole

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,400
organization and that sort of meta

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
process is very playooked but not

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,319
something a founder should do. They

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,080
should absolutely find the the best

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,959
leader that they can. That's really the

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,959
sort of like 0 to 10, 10 to 100 and

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,959
beyond. There's a few things I'll say

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,639
about pricing. The first is make it

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
super iterative. You really need to

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,120
adapt it and change it until you find

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,880
your price point. Even then, like it's

120
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
only going to last for maybe a year, a

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,639
year and a half before you have gotten

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,160
enough data to say certain parts of this

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,520
are stupid. We need to change it. The

124
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
second is you should start as high as

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,960
pro possible because most founders are

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
shocked at the market uh will pay for

127
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
their product and especially if you're a

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,680
first-time founder you almost feel like

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,880
guilty or greedy asking for certain

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,520
numbers but ultimately for pricing you

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,720
really have to understand the business

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,520
value that a company is getting by using

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,160
your product. And it kind of sounds like

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,320
just corporate jargon, but this is

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,320
actually how companies buy. And so if

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
you're not articulating the actual

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,840
dollar value of your product or if you

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,440
have no idea how to even start, the

139
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
person who's buying your product is

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
going to try to create that assessment

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,759
themselves so that they can take it to

142
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
the CFO and get it approved. And so it's

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
the the real answer is like, do you want

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,320
to be involved in that process or do you

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,759
not? If it's going to get approved, you

146
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
better be involved in that process. So

147
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
you actually do have to articulate if

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,160
you're going to drive revenue in the

149
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
company, how much can you drive? If

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,280
you're going to decrease cost, how much

151
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,360
can you decrease cost? Can you actually

152
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,680
articulate what we call value drivers

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,199
and educate the person who's trying to

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,880
buy your product who's interested in it

155
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
and work with them to sort of build this

156
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
value case together? And then whatever

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,120
that value is, your price should be

158
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,280
about a quarter, two or one/3 of that so

159
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,000
that they get the ROI number on top for

160
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,000
the remaining three quarters.

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,759
The real sort of key to our series B was

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,400
proving that we could repeatably switch

163
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,360
customers off of the status quo in

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,320
privacy, which is incredibly manual

165
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,880
operational work where data owners are

166
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,520
consistently being interviewed, asked to

167
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,360
manually operate on one individual's

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
data when that individual asks to be

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,199
deleted. And that is the status quo sort

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,440
of encoded by legacy incumbent software.

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,720
The real bet at our series A was like,

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,319
can we repeatably show that we can take

173
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
market share? Is there a long-term

174
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,960
outcome where transcend takes that sort

175
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
of top spot in the market? And so our

176
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,199
series A to our series B was really all

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,919
about building our sales team, scaling

178
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,840
up marketing operation, and really like

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,160
delivering a customer experience that

180
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,400
customers would be happy to sort of like

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
do case studies and and sort of shout

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,360
shout about us from the rooftops and

183
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,199
tell their friends to switch as well.

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
And so we we we really tracked like

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,240
milestones around like uh our win rate

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,600
against uh the incumbent competitor and

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
if we could get it to a certain number

188
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,039
we thought that would be really critical

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,960
for our series B story and ultimately

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
kind of like help unstick the market

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,240
that felt like it was kind of like

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
turning into a bit of a cottage industry

193
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
around this this sort of status quo way

194
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
of doing things. And so we we really

195
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,560
kind of like had a metric driven process

196
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,960
against that and just executed really

197
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,880
really well on that plan. So that at the

198
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,520
series B we could tell the full story of

199
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,080
customers are making this like mass

200
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
migration

201
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,080
switch. The current trend in privacy

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,280
right now is first governance of AI

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,360
systems. There is a sort of mad dash

204
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,199
inside every business right now to adopt

205
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,720
AI and part of that is uh compiling all

206
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,960
of the data into a format uh that can be

207
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
leveraged for the purpose of AI for the

208
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,880
those who are technical these are like

209
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,680
vector databases and building embeddings

210
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,080
but there are very few guard rails

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,599
around any of these systems and the way

212
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
that you know perhaps personal

213
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,520
information may be processed on one hand

214
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,160
there's the way that personal data is

215
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,240
being used uh in AI systems and then on

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,199
the other there's the way that AI

217
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,160
systems may be impacting individuals so

218
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,000
like bias and harm fairness uh

219
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
particularly when AI systems are being

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,400
used for decision-m and so the most

221
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,599
recent kind of landmark regulation was

222
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,840
the AI act in Europe many businesses are

223
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,560
trying to understand how they're using

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,800
AI put processes in place around

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,120
ensuring that the guard rails are in

226
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,240
place or that they've appropriately

227
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,320
assessed the impacts of using that AI.

228
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,680
And so that's certainly a current trend

229
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,560
in uh privacy today. And one of the

230
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,800
effects of that a lot of the people who

231
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,920
became like the chief privacy officer

232
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,880
are going through a title change uh and

233
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,560
sort of role and scope change to also be

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,680
the owner of AI governance. Uh and a lot

235
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
of companies are saying kind of like

236
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,600
while we're at it, let's make it like

237
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,959
everything digital governance, all

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,320
regulatory policy, all governance of our

239
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,560
systems short of security. And that has

240
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,320
been like a big sort of industry shift.

241
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,240
The customers and the buyer, the the

242
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
people that we sell to are undergoing

243
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
just a massive sort of change in scope.

244
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
And so that's that's a really important

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,120
trend right now. And then like every day

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
there's something with in privacy that's

247
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
like wow that's a really creepy thing

248
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,560
and like or there'll be a data breach or

249
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,640
there'll be you know something that is

250
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,320
like always driving the news you know

251
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,720
the news meta sunglasses for example um

252
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,760
it took about like 3 days for someone at

253
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,760
uh some two kids at Harvard uh turn that

254
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
into a system which can like literally

255
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,519
just tell like find people's online

256
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,680
profiles as you walk down the street.

257
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,760
it's just like overlaying their like

258
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,600
name, LinkedIn, job title, just by

259
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,080
facial recognition. So there's like all

260
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,800
kinds of crazy stuff um just like in the

261
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,800
the the daily news. But categorically

262
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,800
the shift toward u AI governance and

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,820
this broadening sort of supererset of

264
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:18,480
privacy.

266
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:31,169
