00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,439
Hello Sharks. My name is Mattie Salin

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,880
and my product is called Wake and Bacon.

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,039
I'm asking for $40,000 in return for 20%

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,960
equity.

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,840
So, while I was getting my master's

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,840
degree at NYU University, I took an

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,160
introductory electronics course where we

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,640
had to make a device for the home. And I

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,399
wanted to remake an alarm clock. And so,

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,280
I canvased my fellow students asking

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,360
them what their ideal way to wake up

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,000
was. Now, I can't say what the number

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,920
one answer was on

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,480
television, but the close second was the

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,600
smell and taste of bacon. And so

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,520
inspired, I went home and I built the

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,559
world's first alarm clock that actually

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,719
wakes you up with

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,559
bacon. Here's how it works. So, the

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
night before you open up the chamber and

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
you put in a couple of slices of

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,200
pre-cooked bacon, and then you set the

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,400
alarm for, say, 7 a.m. The next morning

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,600
at 6:50, the clock silently turns on,

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,759
and it heats up the bacon to a crisp so

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,920
that the smell is really strong and can

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
wake up any bacon lover. You can then

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
actually just roll over in bed, open it

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
up, and eat the bacon yourself. You can

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
cook the bacon and then eat it. That's

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
right. Shut up. I'm serious.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
I built this and I thought it was a

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,320
lark. So, I posted on my website and

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,920
wake and bacon went viral. I've been

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
inundated with hundreds and hundreds of

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
emails of people who are begging me to

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
sell them one. And so, with the money

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm asking for, I want to redesign this

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,720
for mass production and get a functional

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,640
prototype so that I can go pitch this to

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,640
retail partners and manufacturing

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
partners and investors. I've actually

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
got an artist rendering of what it could

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,520
look like if mass-produced. Notice the

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,799
hose.

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,840
And this is what it looks like with the

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,680
tray open. And the cord is a little

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,640
corkcrew. I thought of everything.

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,239
Can we try it? Oh, absolutely. In fact,

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,160
um I've got some for you right now.

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
Hey, Maddie, I I love the face of the

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,920
pig. Do you have a slogan for this or

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,560
anything? Rise and swine.

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Oh, lordy. Matt, how long does it take

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,400
to cook? Uh, it takes 10 minutes to

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,800
reheat. So, Maddie, what happens when

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,360
we've sold 10,000 of these and the

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,360
10,000 and first catches on fire and

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,360
burns the couple to death in their bed?

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,560
Well, it needs it. It has to be

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,080
ULlisted, which means it's safe for the

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
home for any I'm going to ask you. You

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
think they want an oven cooking bacon

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
next to a bed? Well, you know, there's

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
the uh Easy Bake oven out there. What

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
about next to somebody's bed at 2:00 in

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
the morning? You don't know where a

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,160
kid's going to put the Easy Bake oven.

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
If they if they made it through that,

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
then I'm sure that I can find a way to

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
get this UL listed and safe for the

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,959
home.

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
This is fantastic. You have any idea of

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,720
pricing? Do you know what your margins

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,200
will be? So, it'd be about $13 per unit.

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,519
I mean, you're asking for $40,000. So,

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,560
once you burn through the 40 to make the

78
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,560
prototype, where's the money going to

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
come from to sell it? I want the money

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
so that I can then pitch this to retail

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,720
partners and manufacturing partners.

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
Matt, let me see if I get this right.

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120
This is a novelty item. Yes. You think

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,879
you can sell how many units? I'm not

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,560
sure. I don't have a projection of how

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,200
many units I could sell.

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,200
At least throw out a forecast. Say 1.26

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,920
million in the first quarter. Even if

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
you're lying to me, at least that's

90
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,400
interesting. You got no projections

91
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
whatsoever. You got a pig box that's

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
going to catch on fire and kill

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
somebody. I'm going to be sued into the

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
stone age. I'm out, but I'll give you

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,080
100 bucks for the pig box.

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,959
Is the pig box for sale? Uh, no. It's

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,879
the only one I have.

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
Maddie, I think your idea is whimsical

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,040
and it's a great novelty gift. Thank

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,640
you. That's my compliment. I don't think

101
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,920
anyone really wants to have bacon that

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
close when they're waking up. I think

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,920
they like smelling in the kitchen that

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
mom's making. So, I'm out. All right,

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,799
I'm taking my piece of bacon and I'm

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,720
out. All

107
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:20,759
right. I like I like bacon.

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,759
Get on it. In or out?

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm out. All right. Let me ask you this,

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Maddie. What do you think the minimum

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,160
production run is? Um, I think it's

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,520
10,000 is the lowest I can go. So, that

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,680
means if your full cost for these is 15

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,400
bucks a unit, basically 13 bucks a unit.

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
So, it' be $130,000. Where is that money

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,680
coming from? That's where I need to

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,759
partner with a retail partner or a

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,800
manufacturing partner or an investor.

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
You're not going to put your name on

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,919
this cuz I'm going to sue you into the

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
stone age after my bed catches on fire.

122
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,560
I know how to buy insurance. So, we can

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,720
deal with that. The bigger problem that

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,720
I have literally and being very

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
interested is you needed

126
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,199
$170,000. You only asked for 40.

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm now asking for $170,000.

128
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,600
[Laughter]

129
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
Mark, are you really interested in this?

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,400
I like the idea. You really think

131
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,160
cooking bacon bedside is a good idea? It

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,759
doesn't matter. If I had to guess the

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,680
percentage of people who would actually

134
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,880
make bacon, I'd say 10%. And if I had to

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,800
guess the number of people who would

136
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,639
make bacon twice, I'd say 0%. How many%

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
set the house on fire? Well, that's what

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
the the point though is they're not

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
going to use it to make bacon. This is

140
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,120
going to be a present for dad because

141
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,120
it's so darn stupid.

142
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
And Mark Cuban puts his dough into

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
stupid ideas. Is that what I'm here for

144
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
today? It's a gag gift. The problem is

145
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm not going to put up the 130,000.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,400
That's the problem.

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,400
Because of that, Maddie, I'm out. All

148
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,280
right. Thank you for your time. Okay.

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I'll give you 200 bucks for the pig box.

150
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
Listen, I figure I'm going to save

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,880
children by doing that. We're going to

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,240
put that in my museum of really bad

153
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,600
ideas that can kill

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,160
people. Okay. Hey, 300 bucks to the pig

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,479
box,

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,520
Maddie. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck,

157
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,520
Matt. Good luck, man. Thank you.

158
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,759
I wonder if he has any extra bacon on

159
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,240
him. So, basically, Mark, if you would

160
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,199
have asked for 170,000, you were in. I

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
would have tried to get you guys

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,000
involved and I would tried to sell

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,800
y'all. We would have said no. I'm very

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,120
persuasive. We slaughtered that one.

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
People love bacon and bacon mania is

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,199
sweeping the nation. I'm going to find a

167
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,319
way to build wake and bacon and get it

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,319
on every nightstand in America.
