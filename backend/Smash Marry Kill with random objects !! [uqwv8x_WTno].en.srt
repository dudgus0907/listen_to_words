23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,040
you're the pope I'm absolutely this is a

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,060
pope like resonate with you a lot you

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,100
often bring him up another rats resonate

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,680
isn't a word so he doesn't resonate with

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,180
me it resonate what's the word I don't

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,820
know he just seems like I'm already at

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,500
two mice no more can you stop looking at

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,180
the [ __ ] mice like why do you why'd

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,100
you say Mike yeah because there's one

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,460
rat one mice and I feel like mice you

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,079
can tell the difference from this far

34
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,820
I have a mouse in this hand and a rat in

35
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,020
the other and I would not oh you would

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,420
know I can't okay you can't tell no a

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,960
mouse is this [ __ ] big a rat is like

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,960
that big

39
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,299
then it's like that big it's like a

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,060
little bit bigger okay and mouse is like

41
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,179
that [ __ ] Chris okay

42
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,099
anyways today we're going to be playing

43
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,840
smash Mary kill with different things

44
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,700
the reason I said smash is because I

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,099
just believe the word like like I know

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,160
we say the F-bomb a lot but I feel like

47
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,160
in this F bomb in this tense

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,020
the F word's really strong okay like I

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,819
feel like the action of it is way more

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,560
stronger than just using the word so

51
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,959
we're going to use the word smash so

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,480
smash Mary kill with three random

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,280
objects that you guys helped us Supply I

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,720

today so that actually kind of just

58
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,660

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,239
this it resonated with you I resonate it

60
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,480

71
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,260

Fork spoon and knife classic oh I kept

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,920

spoon I [ __ ] hate spoons spoons oh

82
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,599
and knife is more particular I think I'm

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,400
killing the knife I think honestly but

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,120
what are you gonna cut with only a fork

85
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,180
and a spoon okay but the second the

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,040
forks the fork can do it no the Mary we

87

88
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,760

yeah he can be put in any single

90
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,200
situation he's battling his other side

91
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,599
soup but guess what I can just sip it

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,940

93
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,100

94
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,840
ramen noodles I only use a fork me too

95
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,400
okay hey

sorry sorry yeah I was like

103
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,699

104
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,320

105
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,360
I don't know fork or spoon like I don't

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400
really know I'm a fork guy okay I don't

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,199
care there's has there been [ __ ] day

108
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,199
shut the [ __ ] up there's been a time

109
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,080
yes with a knife how many times have you

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,960
second guess grabbing a knife zero

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,240
it gets the job OH police Nick what are

112
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,780
they gonna do arrest us for oh two good

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,780
content take me in pool hot tub and bath

114
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,960
pool hot tub and bath they didn't throw

115
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,460
shower in there therefore I feel like

116
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,860
the bath isn't important because we're

117
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,660
not talking bathing I agree so bath is

118
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,820
gonna be my cat that's my kill as well

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,680
why because we're not talking bathing

120
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,340
shower wasn't inclusive Smash in the hot

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,039
tub if it was like bath shower wash your

122
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,600
hands I'd second guess but as of like

123
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:45,060
pool I agree Chris yes pool hot tub bath

124
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,460
is getting killed well bath is just a

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,160
more personal hot tub correct for me and

126
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,080
it's a lot less hotter I kind of enjoy

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,000
the bathtub more than I enjoy going to a

128
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,340
hot tub

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,780
Insanity to get clean though yeah but

130
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,180
you can't bathe with friends we're

131
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,580
talking we're talking just Chill Vibes

132
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,160
you can't bathe with friends why are we

133
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,380
talking Chill Vibes because showers not

134
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,479
included oh my God I have to say it

135
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,820
again if we're talking cleaning and

136
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,160
showering the pool and hot tub would not

137
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,960
be included the fact that pool and hot

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,139
tub isn't included therefore they mean a

139
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,199
relaxing bath because a pool hot tub or

140
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,300

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,720

wholeheartedly yes I fully

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,080
wholeheartedly agree you read the next

150
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,699
one all right Santa or a leprechaun kill

151
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,460
the leprechaun [ __ ] the LeBron I gotta

152
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,560
say kill him like yeah kill Santa yeah

153
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,940
and the reason I say is he's too goddamn

154
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,400
busy

155
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,840
if he's bringing gifts to all these kids

156
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,160
on Christmas Eve have a good Christmas

157
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,520
day what do you think he's doing all

158
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
year he don't have time for you ever how

159
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,380
many times you've seen a leprechaun

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,620
never that's it hold on what is it Tooth

161
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,580
Fairy leprechaun no sandster Bunny

162
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,800
Easter Bunny

163
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,860
Easter Bunny's less busy than Santa I

164
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,220
agree that's my point is bringing me a

165
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,220
few eggs

166
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,120
the Easter Bunny supposed to come and

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,680
hide eggs and he really doesn't do a

168
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,259
good job because everyone ends up

169
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,259
finding all of them so well so you think

170
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
think about it I've never read you

171
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,759
haven't found what you never found

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,139
or you don't know that you haven't found

173
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,120
something if you never found it yeah but

174
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,000
like every time these hid eggs I've seen

175
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,860
a ton huh so it's like if I if you if

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,620
you're hiding eggs and I see as many as

177
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,060
I do unless he's hiding double then it's

178
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,680
really not but also what I'm saying is

179
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,160
Santa's the most busy as if he does not

180
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,199
have time for the two other things

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,080

understand how Santa can even manage if

198
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,560
he's only working one night and he's not

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,180
even making the toys he's just dropping

200
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,240
them off he's actually not busy at all

201
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,519
he has 364 days to prep for the next

202
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839

gonna be a fan kill the stapler

222
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,839

measure around no a ruler how old like

224
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,240
with a stapler it's like yeah

225
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,519
okay I go back to it I go back once

226
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,620
again how often are you using a stapler

227
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,300
not very often but when I do need it

228
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,459
something stapled what else am I going

229
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,600
to use

230
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,399
it there's not many times where a

231
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,060
Staples the way that I look at addition

232
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,040
to like oh like a folder Chris what hey

233
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,860
yeah Hey listen the way that I look at

234
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,260
interrupt Nick correct okay the way that

235
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,360
I look at it I can use anything to

236
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,399
hammer something in I could use a

237
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,459
baseball bat but it's the perfect shape

238
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,380
it's the perfect I get it I get it if

239
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:29,180
you're if you're gonna do something like

240
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,180
hammer in the nail there's nothing

241
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,899
not only that but the hammer yeah it has

242
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,660
substitutes so doesn't everything else

243
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,680
in the world a stapler if I if stapler's

244
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,420
not working kill the ruler

245
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,459
listen if the staple is not working I'm

246
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,720
just not gonna staple it it's not that

247
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,480
crucial to me if the [ __ ]

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
doesn't work it jams it gets done it's

249
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,200
done what if it jams I don't need it

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,839
staple that bad there's nothing I've

251
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,180
Ever Needed stapled

252
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,279
I've never needed to stability I'm

253
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,779
killing the stapler ruler how often do

254
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,600
you have to like oh how you don't know

255
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,700
how big something important ruler it

256
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,500
really doesn't get used much when tame

257
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,540
measures around okay but that's what

258
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,120
well I'm I'm grouping them for the

259
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,420
situation well well you're wrong Mick

260
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,060
you still have a tape measure yeah if

261
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,420
you kill the ruler I don't like that the

262
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,060
one way too like like I don't like that

263
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,279
any measuring device should be grouped

264
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,779
in for the city no no no and that's like

265
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,519
saying if we don't have a hammer we have

266
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,140
a drill that's wrong because the hammer

267
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,720
and a drill are two different names no

268
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,300
because if you can call a ruler in a in

269
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,120
a tape measure both measuring devices

270
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,160
then a hammer and a ruler clip paperclip

271
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,019
binder clip anything that holds pieces

272
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,120
pieces of paper together is also with

273
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,680
the stapler I don't like this at all I

274
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,600
don't like this one bit

275
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,079
kill the ruler

276
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,560
smash this up

277
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,560
marry the hammer

278
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,579

279
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,980

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,720
