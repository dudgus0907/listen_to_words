[Applause]

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,520
Next up is a product that ensures you'll

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,189
always have an essential accessory when

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,089
you need

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,089
[Music]

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,240
it. Howdy Sharks. My name is Zach and

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm from a small town just outside of

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,359
Dallas, Texas. I'm seeking

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,119
$350,000 in exchange for 15% of my

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,800
company, Permapug. Sharks, picture this.

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
You get home from a long day of work.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
You finally get comfy in bed or on the

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
couch. Your phone's on 1%, so you reach

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,079
for your charger. Wait, where is it?

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,480
It's missing again. So, what could you

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,760
do to try to fix this? Maybe you could

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,920
try a sticky note. Zach's charger. Do

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
not move. Use extra bold lettering and

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
exclamation points to make sure that

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
they know you're serious this time.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,480
Maybe you could just buy dozens of cheap

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,680
chargers every few weeks and hope

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
there's one around when you need it.

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,160
Maybe you could even try supergluing

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
your charger directly to the outlet. I'm

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
kidding. Do not try this at home. But

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,760
somehow someway that charger will still

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,360
end up getting borrowed but never

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,200
returned. This is a daily dilemma for

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,479
millions, but not for those who've been

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,400
lucky enough to

32
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,720
discover. The permlug charger lock.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
Permoplug charger lock is a proprietary

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
fully patented locking system that

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
secures your charger and cables into

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
place so they can't be moved, stolen, or

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
accidentally unplugged. Let me show you

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
how it works. First, you'll simply

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
remove your existing outlet cover.

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
Assemble your permlug system, which

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,119
includes the locking cover, a dual fast

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
charger, and up to two charging cables.

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,880
Then, you'll place the permlug charger

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
lock directly on your upper outlet. And

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
then you'll screw it back in using the

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,680
included standard screw. Or you can

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
upgrade to a security screw for added

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,960
protection. And boom. Start charging

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
without ever worrying about your charger

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,799
or the cables growing legs and going

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,040
missing again. So Zach, honey, sweetie

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
poopsy baby. Wait, let him finish. Oh,

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,000
you're not done. I know you're excited.

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,759
I am,

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,680
too. Good job.

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,119
Phones, headphones, tablets, and other

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
devices are a crucial part of our

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,080
everyday lives. They're not going

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,160
anywhere. Protecting the lifeline of

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
these devices is a no-brainer. So,

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,959
Sharks, who's ready to secure your

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,040
chargers and a deal with Permablug? Good

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,200
job. Oopsie baby. The issue is this

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,239
solves the problem in your home, but if

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,080
you're like in a hotel or on the road,

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,440
it's not really practical, right? It's

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
just for permanence unless you're the

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
hotel. It depends. The hotel would be

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
the one that purchased them from us. And

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
there is a ton of unique applications in

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
commercial settings. Oh, that's an

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
interesting point. You're saying the

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
hotel can then do that so that they

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
provide it for their guest. Guests don't

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,040
take them away or even their staff in

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,120
the background. Yeah.

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,160
I do not deserve to rip you to pieces if

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,720
you have sales. Okay. Do you have any?

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,400
Um I do. I have about uh $2,000 in

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,440
sales. Okay. I am now going in sales so

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,400
far today. I have uh $456,000 in sales a

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,680
year to date.

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
That's a good answer. That's a great

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
answer. That'll go down in Shark Tank

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,560
history right there. How did you get

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,560
450,000 in sales? I brought the sales in

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
all myself. So, I originally filed the

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,319
patent for this in 2019. So, it goes all

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,680
the way back really to whenever I was a

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
kid. I grew up with cousins. We all grew

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
up on the same street. We always stole

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
each other's chargers. And then in 2019,

93
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
I went and stayed at a friend's house.

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,879
And when I stayed at his house, I slept

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,720
on his couch and I had my phone plugged

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
in to his charger. It was super glued to

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,120
his outlet. So, light bulbs flipped and

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,040
I knew this was a good product and

99
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,239
brought it to life. This is for anybody

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,640
that has one child or more. I got three

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,280
teenagers. It happens by the minute. How

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,519
are you selling it today? The 450,000.

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,599
So, by the way, is that for the year?

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,000
That's year to date. I'm 665,000

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,680
lifetime, which is 12 months last year.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
Who are you selling it to? Fully direct

107
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,439
to consumer. My customers range all over

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,799
the place. So, parents tired of their

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,720
kids moving the charger, siblings,

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,159
roommates, and a huge one right now is

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
schools. They're buying them so they can

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,519
charge the tablets for their kids.

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,000
social all through social media. All on

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
your website or Amazon. So, Amazon's a

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
huge channel for me and I was resistant

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
to doing that at first, but it's

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
actually 60% of my revenue is Amazon

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
now. And I don't love that because I

119
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
don't own the customer data. You guys

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
know how that is. But I incentivize

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,840
people to try to buy on my website with

122
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
better pricing. Are you buying a lot of

123
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,479
ads? Most of my marketing is organic. I

124
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
do have a retargeting funnel set up so I

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,040
can just retarget the people that have

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
engaged with my organic. Yeah, good for

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
you. So, and I'm I have a SEO

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
background. So, I built all of these

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
automation tools using automation and

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
AI. So, for instance, like if I'm

131
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
talking to somebody and they say, you

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
know, what's the best Father's Day gift

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,759
for 2024? I can text myself that,

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,160
generate a blog post, make sure her a

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
plug is number one uh Father's Day

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
present automatically published on my

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
site and indexed by Google. I want to go

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
back to this 350,000 15%. What are you

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,440
going to do with the 350? I I'll use it

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,560
to help increase my flow. So, I've got a

141
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
decent amount of money in the bank, but

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,280
I am playing cat and mouse a little bit

143
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,960
with inventory buying cash flow in the

144
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,360
bank. What's the container? I have about

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
80,000 worth of inventory right now. Um

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
that's that's a lot. That's my hard

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
cost, but I mean I'm selling 15,000

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,479
units, so I'm I'm moving them pretty

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
quickly. You're making any money on the

150
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,320
465,000 you're Absolutely. My margins

151
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,479
around 58%. So what do you put in your

152
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,280
pocket? And what do you sell it for? So

153
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm I buy those for about 650 each and I

154
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,039
sell them for about $35 on average. Do

155
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
you know your customer acquisition cost

156
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
in the last few months? They're they're

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
less than 15 bucks because I'm only

158
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
doing warm retargeting. that have not

159
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
engaged intent intently with one of my

160
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
organic videos. It cost you 15 bucks to

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,120
acquire a customer and the average order

162
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,039
size it's around $58. All right. Look, I

163
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,560
I thought this was a joke. I got to be

164
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,360
honest with you, Zach. Obviously, sales

165
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,600
say no. And you you sound very credible.

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Um so here's an offer for you. I'll do

167
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,199
the

168
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,479
350%. I want two bucks a unit in

169
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,039
royalties in perpetuity.

170
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm curious who's on your team. How

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,440
much? Just you. This is all me and my

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
wife. We have a 24-hour fulfillment

173
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
promise notice. We're up till midnight

174
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,520
packing orders. Doing everything. It's

175
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,479
your full-time job. Yep. And do you have

176
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,720
any debt? Do you own it 100%. I own it

177
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
100%. Zero debt. So, I am doing this

178
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,600
full-time now. I'm living off of my

179
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
savings for now. I don't plan to take

180
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
any sort of profit or salary from the

181
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,199
company until 2025 just to make sure

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
that I have enough float for the company

183
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
and there's enough inventory and I'm not

184
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,479
fighting with paying myself for that.

185
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
So, I've saved up enough from my job to

186
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
live off of until then, but I do plan

187
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120
on, you know, obviously taking a modest

188
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,000
salary next year. Good for you, man. You

189
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
know, everybody I meet wants to be

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,479
successful, but so few people are

191
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,000
willing to make the sacrifice and pay

192
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
the price. We've made a ton of

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
sacrifices, too, honestly. Like, I mean,

194
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
we've, my wife especially, she's put in

195
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
tons of work with me. She doesn't have

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
to do any of that. She's got two

197
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
full-time jobs taking care of a three

198
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,400
and a halfyear-old and a 2 and

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
1/2month-old right now. So, and she's

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
out there grinding with me. I'm I'm here

201
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,280
right now and she's at home packing

202
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,520
orders. back. What's your reaction to

203
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Mr. Wonderful's not so wonderful offer?

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
Well, I I figured coming in here I may

205
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,560
get an offer something like that. I

206
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,240
would not be open to a perpetuity deal,

207
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
but I would be open to giving a royalty

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
to anybody for that matter until your

209
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,599
money's paid back because I don't like

210
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
borrowing money. Zack, why is that

211
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,520
interesting to an investor? Because I

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,960
give you my money, I put it at risk, I

213
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
wait two and a half to three years to

214
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
get it back. I make nothing on it. Could

215
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,080
be sitting in the bank making 5.24%. The

216
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,319
only other value is an exit on the value

217
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
of the patent, which may or may not play

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,199
out. So, you're putting your largest

219
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:33,919
investor at 100% risk. Well, I'll give

220
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:35,520
you your $350,000 for 25%. No royalty.

221
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,479
Okay. If you don't mind me asking, what

222
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,360
does that put the valuation at? 1.4.4.

223
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,280
Okay. He's doing 1.4.

224
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
I have good news and I have bad news.

225
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
What do you want first? Um, that's for

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,319
the bad news. It's I'm a delayed

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,479
gratification type of guy, so I'll go

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,879
bad news first. Always get the bad news

229
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,840
first. There you go. Always.

230
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
Want to know the good news? That's the

231
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
good news. Yes, ma'am. I'm back in.

232
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,240
Okay. Goodness. Okay. My next question

233
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,960
was going I just I had to do that to you

234
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,599
for like your whole what you did to us.

235
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,319
Yes. 2000. I thought you'd appreciate

236
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,960
that. So, I'm going to offer you

237
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,360
350,000.

238
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:22,000
I would like 20%. Okay. And I'd like a

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,840
royalty of $1 until I get paid back my

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,879
money because I think together it'll be

241
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,639
a powerhouse. That's my offer. All

242
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
right. That's a great offer. What are

243
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,520
you going to do? Thank you. Here's my

244
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
thing. I'm like Kevin. I didn't I didn't

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
think it was real. I thought you were

246
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,159
That is true. You were negligible at

247
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,279
best. But congratulations. I uh you're

248
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,880
you're doing great. Um it's just not for

249
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
me. Yes, sir. I'm out. Thank you for

250
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,080
your time. I appreciate it. Yeah, Zack.

251
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm kind of in the same boat. It's a

252
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
great product, but you know, SEO

253
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,240
already, you know, maybe some cash flow

254
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
things. You got this on lockdown and you

255
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
know it, right? So, yeah, it's just not

256
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
a fit for me. So, for those reasons, I'm

257
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
out. Okay. You have three offers. She's

258
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,320
got the best offer on the table. Well,

259
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,920
no, she's not Mr. Wonderful. What does

260
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,399
that mean? Well, it means what it is. I

261
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,959
did my research on all this. You guys on

262
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,760
the table, I am also the best partner

263
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,040
for you. I I grew up not caring about

264
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320
being an athlete. I didn't look up to

265
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,839
any athletes. I didn't look up to any

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,279
actors or anything. I looked up to

267
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,720
people like you guys. So, I know

268
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
everything about all of you and I know

269
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,440
what you've done with companies and you

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
and everything you guys have all done is

271
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
extremely motivational. It's it's

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
inspirational. This is everything I've

273
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,760
ever worked for. Lory's offer is by far

274
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,680
I mean in my opinion just I came here to

275
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
work with you. So, there you go. I would

276
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,080
love to close a deal with you, Lori.

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,640
Thank you. Congratulations. Congrats,

278
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,399
Zach. I love it. I think it's so really

279
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,279
smart, smart, smart. Thank you so much.

280
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,200
Thank you. You're blowing up. There

281
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,959
should be like five in every home. There

282
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
definitely will be. Every single plug.

283
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
Good job. Thank you. Thank you all. I

284
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
appreciate all of your time. Thank you

285
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
so much. Great job. You're really

286
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,680
impressive. Thank you. I appreciate you.

287
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Good luck. Have a good one.

288
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,600
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.
