1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,560
the world changed and the reason is AI

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,279
ignoring that change and saying we set

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,599
out to do this and therefore we going to

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,240
do this just makes no sense and it's

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,280
good to be honest with yourself when

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,920
you're changing the plan communicate

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,720
this to your investors board employees

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,480
and then to yourself when you look at

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,039
yourself in the mirror that the plan is

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,800
now a new plan and that's okay

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,439
understand how the world changes around

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,240
you to take advantage of those

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,920
opportunities now how do you take

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,519
advantage of those opportunities the

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,600
thing is that

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,760
my name is Nikita I'm CEO and founder of

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,640
neon this is my second company so my

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,559
previous company uh single store at Peak

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
it was valued at 1.5 billion neon is a

20
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,360
database company and a developer

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,480
platform where do people get databases

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
today they either download them and

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,840
install them themselves but neon says

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
we're several as postgress we're saying

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
don't worry about servers here's just

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,239
the URL and the URL is all you need to

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
know to build your application neon is

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,359
expanding its Mission from being a

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,010
database as a service to platform as a

30
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:21,939
service so back as a

31
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:21,939
[Music]

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,960
service I'm building databases all my

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,560
life so at Microsoft I joined the team

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,759
called SQL Server so when I joined

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,200
Microsoft soft person all it's an

36
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,920
incredible cheap but it's also a very

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,920
very old and stable product I joined in

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,560
2005 and by the end of 2005 Microsoft

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,520
released the product SQL Server 2005 the

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,640
previous release of that product was

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,119
2001 during that time there were people

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,880
that would come to Microsoft work on the

43
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,799
product leave Microsoft and never ship

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,840
software at all at the time I had a you

45
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,119
know phenomenal offer from Facebook and

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
then took a Facebook off offer and moved

47
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,000
down to the Silicon Valley at Facebook

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
look culture was very different from

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,039
Microsoft and the speed at which things

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,000
were happening was absolutely insane a

51
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,280
lot of people just committed to the

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,599
Facebook mission that engagement was a

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,519
lot higher and once I experienced it I

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,879
realized that this engagement exists in

55
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,680
startups and it does not exist in larger

56
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,800
companies naturally I was very

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,959
susceptible for entrepreneurship and

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,000
then when my co-founder Eric is like

59
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,640
well shouldn't apply to why combinator

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,480
and we got accepted so my previous

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,760
company uh single store at Peak it was

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,440
valued at 1.5 billion you know I spent

63
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,800
there 10 years when I took overover

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,480
single store we probably at a 7 million

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,560
run rate I took it to North of 20 and

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,040
then for the first time in my life the

67
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,200
amount of operational work reduced

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,200
temporarily I'm not the most important

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,519
layer right so you can just remove me

70
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,680
from the organization and the

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,640
organization will probably do just as

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
good and then added this to the craving

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,840
of learning breath and make the plunge

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,480
started another database company uh

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,800
which is neon that's why I left single

76
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,800
store and it kind of panned

77
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,239
out you know it doesn't matter how good

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,200
your technology is if there's no Market

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,840
fit do people want your stuff the best

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,000
feedback of course is people are willing

81
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,360
to buy this product right but even

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,040
before that you kind of want to to throw

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
it out there and see that this product

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,799
is needed by the world and then you put

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,799
all this energy to makeing that product

86
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,040
and making it a high quality product you

87
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,400
want to validate this hypothesis how can

88
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,840
you do that and how can you do it as

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,239
earlier in the startup cycle as possible

90
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,080
we started to do those things open

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,360
sources one then we put together a

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,400
website we were building in the open all

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,360
the code was available on GitHub and

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,840
moreover all the code was available on

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,200
GitHub with a very permissive license

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,560
and then about about 11 months in our

97
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,720
the number of GitHub stars on that

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,519
product started to go vertical meaning

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,879
if you like plot them on the line the

100
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,519
oldest people staring our repo which

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
means they kind of interest in what

102
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,319
we're doing and and that was our first

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,280
product Market fit signal and then we

104
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,040
put the website out we didn't put a

105
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,840
password on it and we thought we were

106
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,840
going to launch in about two months but

107
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,920
between that time and the launch

108
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,560
somebody leaked our website ne. on

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,120
haacker news and there was a lively

110
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,959
discussion you can go and find that

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,759
people going and saying well this is a

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,759
good idea or this is a bad idea and

113
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,600
whatnot you know think about a product

114
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,960
and a company like you creating your

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,919
movie and then your website is a trailer

116
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,080
right and that's how you kind of know if

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,840
a movie is going to be well accepted by

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,479
the audience or not because the trailer

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,800
is out and you're starting to collect

120
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,800
very early signal about the interest of

121
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,600
an audience to that particular product

122
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,720
or service I think that Tech is one of

123
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,000
the many not that many good choices

124
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,680
andte I think is fairly new and that's

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,280
why a lot of them were available and

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
neon was available as well so we bought

127
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,919
that one as an advice for future

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,800
entrepreneurs don't worry about it until

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,080
your product hits product Market fit

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,520
notion waso for for a long time and then

131
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,520
now now everybody uses

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,880
notion here's Silicon Valley it's

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,759
littered with technology that nobody

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,280
wants or needs and that's totally fine

135
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,919
because when you start you just don't

136
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,160
know and it's good to be honest with

137
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,639
yourself when you're changing the plan

138
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,960
communicate this to your investors board

139
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,600
employees and then to yourself when you

140
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,880
look at yourself in the mirror that the

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,919
plan is now a new plan and that's okay

142
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,520
the world is is what the world is and

143
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,800
the world changed then in technology the

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,240
world changes quite often ignoring that

145
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,880
change and saying you know we set out to

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,919
do this and therefore we're going to do

147
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,680
that just makes no sense but being

148
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,639
formal about the steps that you're

149
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
taking and the wise behind those plan

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,360
that I think is a very useful and

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,280
important thing to do and I kind of

152
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,600
strongly recommend everybody who's doing

153
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,199
that to be formal or semi-formal and it

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,360
doesn't mean that you need to like write

155
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,600
six-page documents it could be as simple

156
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,240
as like 1 2 three kind of like Tesla

157
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,240
right I'm going to build a rooster and

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm going to build a Tesla S and then

159
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm going to build a a mass Market Tesla

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,639
3 it could be as simple as this but then

161
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,720
the world changes and then introduces

162
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,319
for Tesla the opportunity to create full

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,039
self-driving and that becomes kind of

164
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,960
like a huge emphasis for the whole

165
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,199
company so not only you need to be

166
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
formal not only you need to be executing

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,400
very very fast you need to look around

168
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,199
the corners and then understand how the

169
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,360
world changes around you to take

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
advantage of those opportunities now how

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,680
do you take advantage of those

172
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
opportunities when you have your one 123

173
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,520
plan you architect your team against

174
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,599
your one 123 plan and then the world

175
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,680
changes and something in this world

176
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,520
becomes more important or becomes an

177
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,240
opportunity and then because the team

178
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,039
you build is the company you build is

179
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,280
another thing that V Coosa says you

180
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,199
might even not have the capacity to

181
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,919
understand how to change the plan and

182
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,680
even if you do you might don't have the

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,520
capacity to evolve the company into that

184
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,639
direction and therefore I think you must

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
bring people from that world that you're

186
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,280
locking and if the world changing in a

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,039
particular direction try to get the

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,120
people who are experts in the direction

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,400
that the world is heading because if you

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,479
don't have the right people around you

191
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,479
you won't come up with a good

192
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,960
plan the hardest things are about people

193
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,639
the other hard things are when things

194
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,520
are just not working and when the things

195
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,599
are not working you spend an

196
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,479
extraordinary amount of energy to make

197
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,319
them work and then they work for a

198
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,280
period of time and then they stop and

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,599
they stop because even either you know

200
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,520
have a product Market fit or technology

201
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,599
is not good or competition is kicking

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,960
your ass and so you're burning a lot

203
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,360
more money to make it work and it takes

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,800
the highquality team to work through

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,879
those moments ideally you work through

206
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,919
them without losing your cool that's

207
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,360
when then the stuff is tested and people

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,159
lose patience people quit blame each

209
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,240
other we had it all you know living

210
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,159
through this once uh hopefully had made

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,360
it a better founder and compared to

212
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,440
single story me seems like L smoo

213
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,599
sailing there's the length and then

214
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,800
there's the growth it only feels long if

215
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,479
the growth slows down or stops and then

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,199
you start looking in the mirror and

217
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,840
asking yourself is that what you signed

218
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,479
up to do is like is this grind is ever

219
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
going to stop or it's growing and in

220
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,960
this year we grew over six times in

221
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,120
revenue and when you look at this it's

222
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,120
like w like the scenery really is

223
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,280
changing and the stuff that we're doing

224
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,960
now is like not the stuff that we were

225
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,000
doing in the beginning of the year as

226
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,640
long as we're in that state it's forever

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,839
the fog of War usually clears as the

228
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,479
company goes along and right now it's

229
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,320
pretty thick with NE you know the

230
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
company is clearly working there product

231
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,200
Market fit our customers love it more

232
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,000
and more of them coming every day onto

233
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,000
the neon platform we reach into things

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,560
that we almost didn't think we would

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,640
even consider in the AI space and in the

236
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,240
broader platform space and if back in do

237
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,000
a service it's when the growth slows or

238
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,880
the world moves on in a different

239
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,680
direction or a competitor kicks your ass

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,440
that's when the music stops playing as

241
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,200
long as the music keeps playing I think

242
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,000
it's it's just a lot of fun to keep

243
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,000
dancing to this music
