00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,340
idea what people will say sometimes when

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,020
someone thought that the X from when we

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,579

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,899
X on your hand for being yeah they

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,059
thought I was just like what did they

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,440
think it's not a tattoo that's a dad

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,120
thought as well

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,000
dad called me and I was like did Matt

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,140
get it okay dad like but let's think no

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,360
I actually talked to that on the phone

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,640
this actually reminds me dad called me

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,039
and he goes he goes oh my God I almost

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,420
had a heart attack I looked quickly when

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,760
I watched the new video about the X on

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,260
your hand was uh was a tattoo and I go

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,580
Dad if I was getting hand tattoos I'd

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,260
think it out a little more than just an

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,780
X yeah because really what would you get

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,640
I said golf clubs that said my dad's the

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,700
best golfer across my Knuckles and he

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,680
was laughing oh yeah I miss you Dad

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,020
what are you doing if you go to a new

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,240
food place and you try a new food you're

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,100
like it's so good and you try it for the

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,740
first time

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,619
and you're allergic to it like deathly

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,240
getting an EpiPen and hitting my guy

38
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,220
with it well I don't think I'd know I'm

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,320
allergic till I leave the restaurant if

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm being fully honest you're definitely

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,560
allergic to something like that it's

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,780
gonna hit the second year no I think I'd

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,360
eat it first and then like really let it

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,060
sit and then I wouldn't know that I'm

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,100
allergic to my throat is closed

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,700
do you think restaurants have epipens

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,560
like in case uh really no but they got

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,899
phones I can call the police no they

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,340
should they should have epipens need to

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,659
be like prescribed they should also have

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
like time like things I'm pretty sure

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,720
that you can't just go and buy one can

53
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,240
you yeah you can I could go buy an

54
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,700
EpiPen I think you can tell your doctor

55
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
I want to buy epipens like yeah yes but

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,720
I couldn't right now well it doesn't

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
matter because like if you go into like

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,140
yeah the hair if you're going to

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
anaphylactic shock like you need an

60
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,760
EpiPen you have to end up at the

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,739
hospital so you have to call 9-1-1 and

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,480
all ambulances and fire trucks I'm

63

pretty sure have to have it you wanna

64
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,020
know what I think they should invent at

65
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,940
least two but what I'm saying is like I

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,620
couldn't go get an EpiPen right now so

67
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,560

82
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,860
what would y'all do if you were on Earth

83
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,640
when the asteroid no hold on wait go

84
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,739
back

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,599
to the next thing about the EpiPen in

86
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,500
restaurants I think that they should

87
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,900
invent a machine called The Hacker

88
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,700
and it's a big machine that every

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,379
restaurant's required to have and you

90
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,239
can decorate it like to your restaurant

91
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,739
like say you're not really very

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,099
important yeah so you have like a really

93
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:28,019
floral New Era Vibe like Cafe

94
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,720
like it's the new era like it's the new

95
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,239
guy guitar

96
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,220
it's youth it's fresh God forbid you

97
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,519
finish

98
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,519
Jesus Christ

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,900
it's called the hacker right we got that

100
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,120
and if you're joking like you need the

101
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,060
Heimlich you just sit in it and it like

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,140
like knows like your body type okay this

103
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,720
person needs to have like and the

104
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,720
Machine starts doing it why the hacker

105
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,099
because heck like you're hacking it up I

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
thought it was like gonna be like some

107
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:03,360
like no not internet hacker like like

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,739
okay yes and so basically this machine

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,360
just like it's kind of like a roller

110
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,060
coaster thing that like comes over the

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,159
top and on your diagram and it's just

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,260
like and it's like doing the Heimlich

113
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,540
like right like you stand up and it's

114
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,000
latched to the wall because that way too

115
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,260
much I feel like it's way more I just

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,820
want to see this machine decorated

117
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,660
but they put roses no because what I'm

118
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,400
saying

119
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,080
using their flower petals shooting

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,639
everywhere no yeah it's like because you

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
want it to fit the theme like how would

122
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,960
it look like a song

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,600
[Laughter]

124
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,520
so no one's allowed to show

125
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,000
get in the [ __ ] hacker you look like

126
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,919
a fool me exactly like look at you like

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,180
no if someone does the high look if

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
someone does the high look and you don't

129
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,680
go to the hacker you're choking like out

130
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,320
of style out of fashion yes you need to

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,600
choke like it's 20 23. exactly go to the

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,000
hacker like go hack it up this is insane

133
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,040
but no basically the machine is like

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,380
specifically designed to help every body

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,139
style every body type and it's just like

136
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,639
really so it's an inclusive no but it

137
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,500
really like because I feel like I feel

138
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,320
like to be honest it's sucking like it's

139
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,900
closed you know like Technic listen I am

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,720
technically like heimlich certified I

141
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,419
have the card so do I yeah would you

142
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,780
rather a like machine that is built for

143
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,340
it or me to do that honestly you what

144
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,960
what are you doing if you go to re-watch

145
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,780
The Wizard of Oz in the yellow brick

146
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,639
road is pink but they constantly call it

147
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,780
the yellow brick road like they Follow

148
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,520
the yellow brick road and it's there's

149
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,280
not yellow and it's just pink the whole

150
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,900
time yeah and they refer to it as like

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,500
the yellow brick road I literally really

152
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,820
probably going to the bathroom

153
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,800
stare at myself in the mirror for a

154
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,080
solid like 30 minutes and just question

155
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,360
everything about me

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,300
okay and I'd get something pink and

157
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,580
something yellow like pink lemonade

158
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,460
because it probably includes both right

159
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,740
people how many just both just pink

160
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,840

164
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,460
you were on Earth when the asteroid came

you tried to like being with the friends

219
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,240
I would re I would relive I would relive

220
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,520
school I thought it was a great fun I

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,740
hated school 24 hours left to live what

222
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,140
would you do this to God I want to be

223
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,320
duct taped to a skateboard and go to the

224
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,240
tallest skate ramp of life like super

225
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,979
tall I'm just gonna skate down it that's

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,800
really weird if I fall and die I was

227
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,779
gonna in hours anyway I think if I knew

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,240
I had 24 hours left to live I'd do

229
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,100
something that like people don't do

230
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,399
because like you could die doing it oh

231
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,600
so Chris's answer literally my answer is

232
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,220
no I don't want to get duct tape to a

233
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,320
[ __ ] skateboarding you don't have to

234
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,820
you can just do the skateboard the duct

235
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,860
tape portion was to add an element of

236
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,420
spice and Pizzazz to my

237
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,700
to my thing I thought it was so that you

238
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,339
could see what snake you're just foolish

239
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,279
no I'm not yes you are you're [ __ ]

240
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,320

241
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,760
what if I died tomorrow but everyone

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,860
thought it was you what would you do

243
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,200

244
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,880
promoting like your death but it's

245
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,740

250
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,959
biggest fear ever well like I was if I

251
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,220
was alive and one of y'all died and

252
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,200
people thought it was me I'd feel so

253
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,240
guilty inside why oh I don't want to

254
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,240

376
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,300
tired of it why that's like like that

377
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,639

378
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,240
for years crazy random [ __ ] that makes

379
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,860
no sense ears everything I say has

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,300
statistics and logic that's very

381
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,459
incorrect I think we just started our

382
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,839
own business firm what I don't even know

383
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,720

really execute like really good work and

385
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,740
some imagine if we were like in suits

389
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:37,380

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,680
market in Google yes I see Google on a

391
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:44,399
high trajectory I like to invest when

392
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,480
the stocks are low Buy Low sell big I

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,480
don't know what any of this means

394
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,260
Buy Low sell High sounds really good

395
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,360

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,800

437
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,520

take a sip of the lemonade spit it out

442
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,480
so that's not worth five cents

443
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,980
it's time to figure it out really yeah

444
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,539
it's time to really think about it and

445
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,020
figure it out because what you're doing

446
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:41,419
right now is not gonna cut it

447
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,980
tastes like gold that tastes like ass

448
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:48,799

449
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,799

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,539

454
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,039
just pitch one leg to do the rest

455
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,900
because you are you have muscles you

456
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,179
have no strength to put the table out

457
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,500

458
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,860
picture of lemonade you probably can't

459
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,299
even pick it up pick it up

460
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,100

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:18,980

shaking it's like all right you're 12.

463
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:28,320

468
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,700

472
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,160
probably

473
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,960
that's why I said it calmly honestly I

474
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,340
didn't raise my voice so maybe we have a

475
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,400
better chance I don't think it matters

476
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,919
if you say anything that's demonetizable

477
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,320
