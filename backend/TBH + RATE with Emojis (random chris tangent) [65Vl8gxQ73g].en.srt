20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
or like kind of

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,860
not rate them but kind of be like a TBH

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240

talking about them let's text it to

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,140
their group chat and then react like oh

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,520
good idea I think we should reenact it

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,380
the second it gets sent as well like

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,740
everyone does their best reenactment of

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,740
it okay

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,360
this is my favorite emoji for so many

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,799
reasons because it's like we I think

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,540
honestly what we should do instead of

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,540
rating them is put like the perfect

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,520
scenario yes yeah like this emojis and

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,380
someone just says like it's like if

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,939
someone texts the word actually like

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,100

I think I think it's so funny when Matt

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,079
uses this Emoji because he'll like

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,000
genuinely be I I love repeating someone

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,360
and then just sending the Emoji with it

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,360

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,380

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
um

189
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,339
Laura texted us a whole paragraph about

190
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,020
our life and how like there's ups and

191
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,300
downs and how like a friendship is

192
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,279
compared to a tree and like you have to

193
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,080
just trim off the Bad branches but the

194
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,140
the tree will still grow and be healthy

195
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,240
and I said amen I agree my goal is to be

196
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,940
a root for all of you if we're and we're

197
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,000
all our own tree help you start and Nick

198
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,860
said I love Roots I'm ready to I'm ready

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,860
to saw some bad branches off

200
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,040
let me see what else I use that in

201
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,700
context with

202
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,080
we were talking about oh here's our own

203
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,459
we were going to Hawaii and Laura sent

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,500
us the hotel we were staying at and she

205
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,600
goes staying here with like a link to

206
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,140
the resort and I said yes we are I would

207
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,820
like that that's weird it's so funny I

208
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,140
feel like a lot of emojis it depends on

209
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,300
like character like I could picture

210
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,040
something

211
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,220
and it totally depends who you are as a

212
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,220
person

213
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:33,600
I've never got scared of me

214
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:36,240
I've never got scared I never in my old

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,240
life got scared by the [ __ ] alarm and

216
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,800
that one did it I think like us

217
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,660
switching parking lots I wasn't

218
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
expecting it it's just funny because

219
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,899

every single day every single dad use

266
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,620
the thumbs up emoji but imagining

267
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,779
someone with a thumbs down

268
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,260

it's in my way

271
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,500
I think I'd honestly rather be flipped

272
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,540

273
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,640

straight up was like

276
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm trying to think of the context here

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,959
and when someone give you like a thumbs

278
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,700
down like if like you [ __ ] were at

279
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,500
the store and you oh my God the

280
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,540
watermelon and it broke everywhere so

281
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,339
I'm just like

282
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,899
yeah imagine you have like a watermelon

283
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,279
and you're carrying it for someone and

284
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,320
then you trip and fall and drop it and

285
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,480
spill it better like water everywhere

286
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,779
instead of cook and someone straight up

287
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,779
was like

288
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,820
oh [ __ ] you like [ __ ] you you dropped it

289
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,260
right middle fingers I'd literally

290
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:29,339
rather that than like a oh man

291
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,740
no good oh no good no good with a thumbs

292
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,320
down bro that makes me feel bad for

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,240
raspberries bro why like how many times

294
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,360
have people pick up fruit that's just

295
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,160
not good now these are no good

296
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,380
this is the most random [ __ ] thing

297
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,440
yeah but just imagine that blueberry bro

298
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,880
imagine being a boss no it just made me

299
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,160
really feel bad thinking of like fruit

300
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,839
and no good like like do you know how

301
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,600
much fruit a day probably people like

302
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,940
look at and examine and they're like Ah

303
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,920
that's no good like maybe like humans

304
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,540
feel like fruit sometimes like what if

305
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,480
what if someone's like going through

306
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,760
like life and like ah no good on that

307
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,519
one like I'm good like that must be so

308
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,740
sad that is upsetting like dude imagine

309
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,360
being like a tray of blueberries and

310
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,660
someone just picks you up spins you on

311
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,820
and says no no good and then it throws

312
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,500
you back into the thing and then no when

313
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,720
it happens multiple but imagine imagine

314
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,700
they take you put you you're in the

315
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,120
basket you go all the way to the

316
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,620
register and the cashier scans and goes

317
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,899
you sure you want these they're no good

318
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,240
and you're like ah and then they have to

319
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,579
re-rubber ban you and like put you on

320
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,980
the waiting goes back to produce

321
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:41,300
probably worse oh this could be imagine

322
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,300
imagine getting put down

323
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,940
ultimate top 10 betrayals ever

324
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,240
dude I don't know why that was what I

325
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,639
thought of no sometimes I feel like

326
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,260
humans treat people like fruit and say

327
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,380
ah not good but they don't look at the

328
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,459
root cause what if every other

329
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,019
strawberry on that strawberry Bush

330
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,959
besides that little batch you picked up

331
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,519
was the best Bush ever It produced some

332
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,380
of the highest grade quality

333
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,480
strawberries ever

334
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,279
and then that one batch is a few

335
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,860
negative ones and we're gonna just go

336
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,360
ahead and say like no good if those

337
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,620
fruit can't get their feelings hurt like

338
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,779
this I feel like we're digging too deep

339
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,660
no it's a metaphor map obviously the

340
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,220
fruit I'm talking about life bro oh all

341
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,660
right like us three are brothers and

342
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,519
stuff right what if one day you did

343
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,380
something bad this was like oh they're

344
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,660
no good because him

345
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,480
what what us there is a group are great

346
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,980
people an awesome rad cool dudes yeah so

347
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,199
for them to profile us as a group

348
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,220
because you're no good for one minor

349
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,899
moment

350
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,320
how'd that make you feel if you were the

351
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,540
blueberry on the bush I agree

352
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,459
you can go see the worst the worst

353
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,320
blueberry

354
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,880
the worst blueberry in the bunch could

355
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,040
make the best blueberry in the bunch

356
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
think of it like this how about this no

357
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,519
I'm done with this [ __ ] I'm gonna cry

358
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,160
bro no I think Chris feels like this

359
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,139
because like when we do like hot tubs

360
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,000
and stuff like that he genuinely like

361
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,760
always talks about how he feels like

362
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,040
like a carrot you know so I feel like he

363
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,760
he very that's a vegetable and a totally

364
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,760
different topic

365
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm not comfortable talking about that

366
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,240
further okay

367
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,760
I feel like you were late

368
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,680
no yes I thought you called me late and

369
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,060
