today I had three do you ever go to like

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,679

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
something else and just like you

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,359

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,439

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
or no no no no I just do you hear how

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,640
crazy that wording was I just sometimes

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,000

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,480

00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,640
like maybe like work St or like oh maybe

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,200
yeah like I work as a clown instead no I

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,480

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,399
talking about being a working clown

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,760

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,040
did I wish we could go back in time to

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,920
like Prime fortnite because no no listen

99
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,599
this one actually has a good reasoning

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,239
Matt get the taser tase me we should do

101
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,879
a video like trying to do emotes like if

102
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,879
we if we were YouTubers in Prime

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,120
fortnite that would actually be

104
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,040
something we could do if there was a

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,079
stero University what would the mascot

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
in colors be and what classes would be

107
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,360
taught there every okay so it's us three

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
like I have my answers for me but we

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,280
have to think as a group and decipher it

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,400
together I think the mascot should be

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,040
the c a candy corn and he like runs

112
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,600
around and he's just like a big corn and

113
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,840
he's like it's like one it's like one

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,400
terrible it's like one piece of candy

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,040
corn and he just runs the [ __ ] around no

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,080
no I think we do something with three

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,360
heads like

118
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Cerberus and then that like that's our

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960
masc got cuz it's we ever tell these

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,840
people that we were Cerberus the

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,759
three-headed dog in a fourth grade

122
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,520
school play no we didn't do we never

123
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,919
tell you guys I don't think we did oh we

124
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,160
we need to find a CD in that for a

125
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,960
fourth grade play mimat and Nick were

126
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,639
cous for the three-headed guard dog of

127
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,400
the underworld our costume was we each

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,600
had dog ears on and we shared a blanket

129
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,080
with like holes in cut out and so it was

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
like one big suit I remember we had one

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
scene in the show where we had to like

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
run across the room and I was in the

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,680
front and I ran out and then I tripped

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,639
and since we were all in like the same

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
shirt we just like landed on top of each

136
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,000
other no but we also it was we actually

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,960
were pretty skilled and talented in that

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
because when we had the three heads it

139
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,120
was like we had share sentences so like

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
it was like I would start a sentence

141
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,919
Nick would let's do it right now improv

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,680
improv real quick just to like so they

143
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,080

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,800

right now it is gross isn't it crazy

329
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,480
that Brands can trademark a

330
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,120
color a in different categories correct

331
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
but like isn't that nuts like there can

332
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,440
be something that's like specifically

333
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,440
like oh this is blue that's like our

334
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,440
blue hourglass I that's what I want to

335
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,600
do if I was a native language speaker

336
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,480
and I had to learn English I'd just be

337
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,880
so mad if I hour and hour is two

338
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,760
different words and they're spelled

339
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,800
different I think if I was arguing with

340
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,839
someone about time or something or like

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,000
if they're late or something I'd want to

342
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,720
say a really funky word like like time

343
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,800
is a mystery or like time is of the

344
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,800
essence something ridiculous whatever

345
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,760
and I'd want to pull like a a normally

346
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,800
large hourglass out from behind me and

347
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,680
shatter it and then just fade away into

348
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,040
a hallway what I don't know I feel like

349
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,079
imagine that like you're talking to

350
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,160
someone you just met at like a about

351
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,279
like time or something and then you're

352
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,680
just like they say something crazy and

353
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,440
then you just say something nuts and

354
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,519
then shatter you want to know what I got

355
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,360
to say an hourglass and F and they never

356
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,639
see you again I love when I meet someone

357
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,160
and I'm talking to them and I know I'll

358
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,399
never see them again that's like one of

359
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,839
my that's my biggest fear that's like

360
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,160
one of my favorite feelings ever

361
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,759
actually I got to give it to you both of

362
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,560
you what you shock me every time isn't

363
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,199
it crazy that like if you had a stranger

364
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,079
to that level like and like there was

365
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,399
someone you didn't know at all complete

366
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,560
stranger and you look at them and you're

367
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,720
like oh I'll never never see them again

368
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,360
if you have free will as a person if you

369
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,199
just punched them in the [ __ ] face

370
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,240
you'd have to see them again like you'd

371
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,320
go probably go to court there be like

372
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,279
that's a crazy like that's crazy no

373
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,360
there's something that could be a

374
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,800
stranger that you walk by I want a

375
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,519
lawsuit with this but if you suck punch

376
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,720

377
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,440
going to see him again I'm sure of it

378
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,800
that's crazier it's crazy that we just

379
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,560
have free will I could just grab a

380
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,399
