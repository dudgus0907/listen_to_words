00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,000
sit back down Chris Chris will always

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,040
say when you ask him if you want

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,599

get yourself something and he gets that

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760

dramatic one could be about minuscule

256
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,560
things one thing I've noticed is Nick

257
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,200
does a lot more talking than doing

258
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,279
really you no that that's a good thing

259
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,200
or maybe I go in your head just to be

260
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,519
like just to see how many different

261
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,760
thoughts pop up from all oh my God you'd

262
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,440
be not like you'd be insane like you

263
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,720
just feel crazy yeah I do right now one

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,959
thing that I've noticed about myself

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,959
lately did you

266
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,480
ask see what I mean like what thought

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,399
just told him I think I have to get

268
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,920
tested for like terat not even kidding I

269
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,920
wouldn't doubt

270
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
it

271
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
I was thinking I saw this Tik Tok this

272
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,639
kid is making slime and he was using

273
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,279
glue and I'm like this could go south

274
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,959
really quick like I don't think we under

275
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,839
like we underestimate how self making

276
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,160
slime can go how could it go that bad

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,920
cuz it was just like Globs of glue and

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,560
like the noise was all chunky and it was

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
like pouring out that how could that go

280
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,440
so poorly it's all about ratio like what

281
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
if you made slime one day and you just

282
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,360
got stuck together that would never

283
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,440
happen like if you're like no and you

284
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,839

362
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,839
motorcycle no what is

363
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,720

deleting Tik Tok forever if you had to

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,759
live in a cage for the rest of your life

366
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,720
would you want the bars to be vertical

367
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,079
or

368
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,720
horizontal I feel like vertical bars so

369
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,639
I can grab them like this horizontal

370
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,120
bars you got to go like that I

371
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,639
horizontal cuz I would learn how to

372
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,279
climb around them oh you're

373
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,279
right no I want vertical so I can break

374
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,639
out like

375
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,240
this you're not breaking out of [ __ ]

376
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,040
yeah correct yes I could I want

377
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,880
horizontal so I could hang upside down

378
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,240
like put my feet through and just in the

379
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,240
funon or if I do vertical so I can

380
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,120
just so fast that's what I would do

381
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,560

382
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,279
