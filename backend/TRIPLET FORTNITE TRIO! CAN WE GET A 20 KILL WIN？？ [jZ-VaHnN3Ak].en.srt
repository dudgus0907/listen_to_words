00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,960
I want to talk about my final gameplay

388
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,260
so go ahead

389
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,900
I thought there was one kid left and

390
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,280
there was actually two so I like like I

391
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,780
knocked one of those kids and like

392
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,660
almost celebrated because I thought we

393
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,640
won and then and then I realized there

394
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,580
was still one left I was like oh [ __ ]

395
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,440
and then I like dropped all the way down

396
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,960
and I thought for sure he was gonna be

397
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,179
in like a full box so I dropped out with

398
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,220
my heavy sniper and literally shot a no

399
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,340
scope like right in front of the kid as

400
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,160
he pumps me for like 180 probably I saw

401
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,559
that oh my God so that I built a wall

402
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,179
and then I felt safe enough to edit and

403
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,679
try to kill it was crazy but that [ __ ]

404
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,480
