1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,480
But what are we doing? What is up

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,319
everybody? Welcome back to the Stern

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,839
Triplets YouTube channel. It's been so

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,280
long since we filmed a video because we

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,040
were just on tour and all that other

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
jazz. But today we're back and we're

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,360
making the tier list on different

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
categories. Let's [ __ ] go.

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,800
We are going to be ranking a bunch of

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,520
different things in a bunch of different

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,640
categories on our custom tier list,

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,279
including the top of the tier list being

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,480
incredible, major, mid, trash, and then

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,559
the bottom tier is mega. What would you

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,559
rank? Have you ever been to your brother

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,280
surprising you with a dozen crispy cream

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,960
donuts a minute away from the house? No.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
Stop. Where would you rank that? Are you

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,719
that ass? Where would you rank that one?

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
Incredible on our list. Incredible.

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
Honestly, I'm putting it in mid only

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:52,120
because Incredible.

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,120
What the [ __ ] dude? Cheers.

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,079
All right, guys. We're about to rank

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,079
stuff.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,520
Don't All right, guys. We're about to go

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,920
rank the category. We'll see you at the

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,920
tier wall.

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,159
All right. Number one, Chester.

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,760
Chester. Whenever something like that

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,439
happens and it actually like blows up,

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,720
it blows my mind because it's like that

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,960
was so like there was we saw that frame

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
in our YouTube video and didn't think

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,759
anything of it. It's definitely above

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,360
mid. It's like here. It was like a major

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,520
like it's not like pivotal. Like it's

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,159
not cool. It's not impressive. I think

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,640
it's like not major. I think it's mid.

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,400
It's It is mid. Matt to the Aoogie

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,000
audios on Tik Tok. Holy [ __ ] Where's

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,360
the tape? No.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,360
Chill. We have to I think this is

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,439
incredible. I think it was an incredible

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,920
pivotable move. I think that everything

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,360
changed. The earth shook. What? Mega

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,439
mega mid trash. Trash. God. I'm like

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,880
starting to feel physical pain. I'm so

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,240
scared. Is it the same vibe? When we

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
were Twitch streaming and they thought I

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
was jerking off, but I was just warming

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,479
up my hands.

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,879
Chad, I'm cold. That was an incredible

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,360
moment. kind of agree. Now it's just

55
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,000
like it was incredibly

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
incredibly ridiculous. That's a mega

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
mid. Get your mind out of the gutter.

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
Blonde Nick. That's not really for me to

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,920
decide. Okay, I have a couple thoughts

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
here. Let's hear it. I think the initial

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,840
pivot was fun. Like going from brown

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,000
hair to blonde hair, but I think that

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,480
there's a photo of me at La's birthday

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,040
party where my hair was literally orange

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,519
and I look like Ronald McDonald. And

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,000
that was a mega moment. It was like, but

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,760
then I think that photo that you have

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
was peak where I was like, "Wow, I look

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
incredible as a blonde." But then it

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
grew out and it started to look bad. I

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
think the more it grew out, the better

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,239
it looks. I agree. I would say major

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
because it's also like in tripletood to

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,879
like break that bond of looking like it

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,360
was an individuality. It was I would say

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,360
that was major. I'd agree. Major major

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,200
moves, Nick. Good agree. Good agree. The

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,360
worldrenowned debate heard across the

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
universe. This is middle part, Matt. No,

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
it's not. Middle. I hope that's in

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
there, but it's a close second. Let's

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,640
see.

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,800
Boston versus LA.

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,560
Like, holy [ __ ] I understand that it

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,720
was like a pivotable. I think it was

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
like to me trash, but like to the fans,

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,680
I understand how it could have survived

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,519
at like a mid level. I think this is a

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
good mid level. Yeah, I can get that. It

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,920
was just mid mid. No, I I don't mind the

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,640
I don't mind the debate. I think that I

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,040
honestly I like how much Boston is an

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,440
always conversation because to me it is

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
an important part of I agree and I'm

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,080
happy like I would hate to just be like

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,440
oh I live in LA and never talk about my

97
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,360
hometown I I like that people like that

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,920
we're from Boston I think it's pretty

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,400
major I but I think that the whole

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,480
debate and discussion is correct but

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,760
like Boston in general that would be the

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,920
first correct what pisses me off though

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,000
and is not true is I saw someone and

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,959
they were like, "How OG of a fan of the

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
triplets are you?" And they were like,

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,680
"I remember when they were the Boston

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,959
boys." And I was like, "What are you

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,319
saying?" What are you talking about? And

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,120
they're they're saying like they're

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,120
claiming that like our YouTube channel

111
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,040
names like not be like Boston. Yeah.

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
Like never happened. Never. We were

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
starting triplets from the moment our

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,759
YouTube career started. No. Nick

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,479
starting and then it was

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,639
starting never Boston boys. OG Twitch

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,000
streams in my room.

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,479
Never talk [ __ ] about Mr. Worldwide like

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,240
that. Ever again. The microphone and

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,880
camera quality were so ass and trash.

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,600
But the vibes were good. The vibes were

122
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,400
insane. I have to be honest here. What?

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,280
It's it's it's the closest to incredible

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,120
we have so far. Are you serious? In my

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
opinion. And this is like peak like this

126
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
is like peak like filming content and

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
mom and dad could also come into the

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,160
room and yell at us still. Yeah, I mean

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,000
really fun. I'd say this is major. I

130
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,479
have when Matt sneezed in the world.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,720
Incredible. How do we feel about that? I

132
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,720
think that that car video like the topic

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
of discussion and the humor one of my

134
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
favorites. Oh, it was legend. Like I

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,880
think Matt sneezing and this video

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,039
concept was incredible. Matt, no mid.

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,120
It's not mega mid. That and this are

138
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,360
equivalent to me. Yeah, you're actually

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
right. They're actually mega mid

140
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
overlook.

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
You're so right, Matt. You're so right.

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Can I pay with my looks? Burger King Tik

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Tok. How do we feel? We're in the Burger

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,960
King drive-thru. I record the lady and

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,880
Nick goes, "Can I pay with my looks?"

146
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
And she goes, she goes, "Yes." Said,

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
"Yeah." Didn't have to pay. I think I

148
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,039
paid for like a $40 meal with my looks.

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,720
No, it was a drink. It was one drink.

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,919
Thank you. Can I pay with my looks?

151
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,479
Thanks.

152
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,280
money.

153
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,759
Oh, it [ __ ] worked. I just paid my

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,160
wounds and furated. I don't think that

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,880
this reach is incredible. This is a

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
major moment. I think it was mid. What?

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,560
I think it was mint. Nobody else has

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,960
ever done this. It was shocking, but it

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,479
was You bargained. You bargained a free

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
drink with your Burger King. Correct.

161
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah, you guys can go major if you want.

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
Major moment. That's major for me. I'm

163
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
happy you guys think it was major.

164
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,919
Brandy Candy screaming and interrupting

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,680
me in the live. That was an incredible

166
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,600
That was incredible. I think like that's

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
the thing too is I think people were

168
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
like so upset by that and they're like,

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,560
"People need to learn tour theater

170
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,319
etiquette, whatever." I thought it led

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
to an incredible funny moment and I

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
loved that show. It was probably one of

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
my favorite shows of the entire tour.

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
I'd say incredible moment. I would say

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,240
incredible. I think that it did start a

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,360
trend of interruptors I feel like on our

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,759
shows, but overall incredible.

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,600
hilarious. Like I think that show was

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
just incredible and that didn't ruin it

180
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,800
for me and it gave me something to laugh

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,800
and joke about and it was like fun.

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,319
Stop talking. Stop talking. Do that.

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,960
When Matt scrambled our eggs and ate

184
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,120
them for breakfast. Your eggs were my

185
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,479
breakfast. Case in point, don't [ __ ]

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,319
with me.

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,880
This was an incredible This was absolute

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,360
cinema. The plot twist of a century

189
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,400
because I truthfully have never been so

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,520
blindsided in our career. Illy right

191
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,840
there. Fully agree.

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,160
Beard Matt. Beard Matt. Where does it

193
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,400
go? Where does it go? Dude, this might

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,240
have to go in major. I think that I

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,919
think that this has to go major. Right,

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,120
Nick? No, cuz I think that there's too

197
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,199
many people like

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Like I think it's like I think out of

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
all three of us, Matt gets the most

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
constant debate and discussion around

201
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,360
like the way he looks. Back up. I got

202
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,160
the tape. I got it in my hand. Relax. I

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,240
think it's a mega mint. I agree. Not

204
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,919
that you look bad. I think once again

205
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
the topic of discuss, but no, it's like

206
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,240
it is exciting to be a fan and be like,

207
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
"Oh my god, my like favorite celebrity,

208
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,080
my favorite person, my favorite

209
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
YouTuber, my favorite internet crush has

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,319
a beard. He looks different." Like I get

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
what they're thinking. I think it's like

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,599
to mega mid cuz I'm blood related to

213
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,680
you, but to the outside viewer, I think

214
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,800
it's a major moment, but I refuse to put

215
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
it there. So, I think we're going to

216
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,520
land on mid. I really love that

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,759
breakdown and that analysis, Nick, and I

218
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
couldn't agree more with you. Okay,

219
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,599
Matt. I just think like I don't know,

220
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:42,399
man. This is why I don't I don't

221
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,240
listen to Jubilee video. How do we rank

222
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,080
this moment in our career? I honestly

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,320
think it was an incredible moment and it

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
was so [ __ ] fun and it was like a

225
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
crazy like YouTuber pivot moment, but

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,560
the fact that the people at Jubilee told

227
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,760
everyone to match and we were one of the

228
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,279
only people who did match was really

229
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,440
embarrassing. Um, if we weren't all

230
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,680
wearing white hoodies, I would say

231
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
incredible. I completely agree. But

232
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,640
because we're matching head to toe, it

233
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,240
was head to toe was major. One of the

234
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,680
craziest moments. Come on, bro.

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,080
The Doc O moment, dude. Her entire spine

236
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,600
had metal on it. Shorty looks like Doc

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,959
O. And I'm like, you're surprised?

238
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,399
You're surprised you're setting this

239
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,760
[ __ ] thing off and you're walking

240
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,680
through with a [ __ ] metal vest on.

241
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
Like, are we for real? You look like Doc

242
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
O going through [ __ ] airport

243
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,240
security, setting this [ __ ] off. You

244
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
didn't think to tell him, "Oh, I'm

245
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,880
[ __ ] laced with metal. Let me walk

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
through this metal detector." You

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,839
[ __ ] sure he's all shocked getting

248
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,480
detected with metal. This right here,

249
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
that was a career establishing rant.

250
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
This right here, that was a This was

251
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,120
when I realized like, holy [ __ ] Nick

252
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,360
ranting in our videos is like the

253
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
funniest thing ever. The key to success.

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
No, and that's the thing is like I've

255
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
met so many people being a YouTuber and

256
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,880
this is one of the moments that they're

257
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
like, I knew that you were funny when I

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,240
watched this clip of Wow. And like

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
watching it back, I'm like, I don't

260
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,760
think it was like that funny. It was

261
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,560
unreal. It was really It was a major

262
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,519
moment. This to me is incredible. I

263
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,760
think it was incredible. Hell yeah. Hell

264
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,480
yeah. I believe this is a moment all

265
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,880
young YouTubers look up to

266
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,480
YouTube. 100,000 subscribers. That was

267
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
probably the most incredible out of

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,040
anything on this list. I totally agree.

269
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,640
Like I think that that was a really

270
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,120
pivotable mental moment in my life. I

271
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,360
fully agree. Yeah. I think above

272
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
incredible. Really? I agree. I think

273
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,320
that's going to be like the best one on

274
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,240
here. It was joy. It was It was bliss.

275
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,920
It was um It was um It was confidence.

276
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,450
It was courageous. It was on future day.

277
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,240
And look at me now. The zoo video.

278
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,519
[Applause]

279
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, round incredible. Like we need to

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
get back on our get back in our bag.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah, for sure. And we need to invest

282
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,320
some money. I'd say this was sick. Thank

283
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,760
you. Feeling like Mr. Beast. Feeling

284
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,440
like I was not feeling like Mr. Beast. I

285
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
was You were feeling like Mr. Beast.

286
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,399
Bonazoo for 24 hours. I was feeling like

287
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,160
a beast. Merch collection with the with

288
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,480
the

289
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,760
subscriber perfectly aligned. Nothing.

290
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,399
Nothing could have been better than

291
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,600
that. It was a great time. I feel like

292
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,839
it was our first ever boys trip as well.

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,320
That was like bros. It was like a really

294
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,640
big as Bros experience. It was and we

295
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
haven't really done No, but it was like

296
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
I think that we also like the As Bros

297
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,040
[ __ ] like you guys joke around about.

298
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,079
But truthfully, doing all of these

299
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,240
things here from mega mint all the way

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,360
to Incredible. Like I love doing it as

301
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,959
bros. Get the

302
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:58,640
next aolo Christmas. This was a really

303
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,440
fun series. This was crazy. I think What

304
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,760
did we do? You want me to read it? Post

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,240
every Monday to Friday. The first video

306
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,320
we posted was reacting to your

307
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Christmas. I don't need to hear all

308
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:16,079
this. Five car videos, four holiday

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,560
vlogs, four podcasts. Wow. That is

310
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,040
actually crazy. I think that that moment

311
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,959
was the most amount of content we filmed

312
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,240
in one period of time. Is that when we

313
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,399
did the Christmas intro that people

314
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,800
hated though? Yeah, but that like look

315
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,000
what everything else we did. I know. I

316
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
actually don't think that that's the

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
same time frame. It's a different

318
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
Christmas.

319
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,200
I think this was major. I don't think it

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,200
was incredible. I agree. I think a

321
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
serial Christmas was like a major fun

322
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,519
moment. It didn't blow my [ __ ] socks

323
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,600
off. Yeah, I thought it was fun. I think

324
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,160
this might be incredible for Nick. Let's

325
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,959
see it.

326
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,360
The Cut the Camera podcast. Yeah, I

327
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,680
sound like Jojo Se being guest on my

328
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,160
podcast. Okay, the first thing that

329
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,279
comes to my brain is that one clip of us

330
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,880
dying the the murder mystery pod when we

331
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
were dying laughing when someone was

332
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,639
getting struck in the head or something

333
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,120
and then the team orange the girl got

334
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,519
that got killed in the orange socks

335
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,680
song. So I think that our podcast I

336
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,519
think I think that our podcast was

337
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
incredible. I think Matt's speaking and

338
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,360
you're interrupting me. You just scared

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,360
me. I thought so many of you scared me

340
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
too. back with no regrets. But we did it

341
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
and we were posting three times a week

342
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,240
and it was pretty exhausting. But what a

343
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:32,440
[ __ ] blast. Major. I'd say major. But

344
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,880
like but like it cheater's incredible. I

345
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,279
think I think this is the first teeter

346
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,920
totter. I can get along with that

347
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:47,040
cuz next up y

348
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:52,519
I'm right. Let's go. What's next?

349
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,959
What? We have the collab with Quen,

350
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,880
[ __ ] Incredible. Don't put a

351
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,040
hole in the [ __ ] wall. You think I

352
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,000
could put a hole in the wall slamming it

353
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,079
like that? Yes, absolutely. I think that

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,079
that collab and then also just all of

355
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,160
our other collabs.

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,600
I hate talking to my brothers. So, if

357
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,680
there's another person in the room that

358
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,639
I can talk to and bounce off of, oh, who

359
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,519
is you?

360
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,279
You stop. You don't [ __ ] disrespect

361
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,000
Matt. What I'm saying is that where did

362
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,760
we put Nick's new haircut? Incredible.

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
Okay. I think growing up, every single

364
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
person that we met was like, "You guys

365
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,000
are so funny. You guys are so funny. You

366
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,399
guys are so funny." And I think it's

367
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,800
because the three of us find ourselves

368
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,480
funnier when we're with another person.

369
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,160
Like I think we were YouTubers who are

370
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,079
meant to collab. Like, and if I'm not

371
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,360
mistaken, we went number one viral.

372
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,120
That was like a lot of like AI. Like it

373
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,079
was like having like an attempt to

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,160
almost start fighting. I went number one

375
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,199
training.

376
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,680
All right, Matt, are you ready? The hate

377
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,880
line's directed towards me. What? It's

378
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,320
not. I'm just talking to my lovely

379
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,959
brother. Okay, freak. Okay, freak.

380
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,079
You're comforting.

381
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,480
Our collab with Sam and Colby. Exactly

382
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
what I just said about Quen's same

383
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,079
experience. You know, I had to double

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,560
it. And if I'm not mistaken, we went

385
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,560
number one viral.

386
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,760
Were you trying to scream?

387
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,519
Try again. I'll end it viral. And if I'm

388
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,440
not mistaken, we went number one

389
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,320
trending viral.

390
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,320
You know, I had to do

391
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,279
it. Incredible. Now, yes. Top three

392
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,240
cheeses. She Vermont sharp, seriously

393
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,320
sharp and mozzarella and parmesan. Those

394
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,000
are four. What's um Kobe Jack? Colby

395
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
Jack.

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
Colobby Jack was my favorite thing in

397
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,720
our whole career. This one? Are you dead

398
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,880
serious? Serious Jack, it's time to

399
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,040
[ __ ] do some soulsearching. Stop

400
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,279
Jesus. Are you serious? Stop.

401
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,959
This and I'm being totally truthfully

402
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,440
honest. It's another cheater. That That

403
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,880
was like, dude, the MLB. It's the

404
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
second. I think it was such a cool

405
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,279
moment. I think that it's like it's not

406
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,279
funny to me now cuz it it's it's been

407
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,240
it's been hammered into the ground

408
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,079
deeper than earthworms scavenge. You

409
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,639
know what I'm saying? Like, it is so

410
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,800
dead. It's so dead. But it shows our

411
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,040
energy through what car videos are. It

412
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,759
emulates the perfect car video humor.

413
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,680
And it is like analyzing our car videos

414
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,240
like he's like a [ __ ] How about the

415
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,160
tier list on the wall

416
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,560
giving me [ __ ] for analyzing the videos.

417
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,839
We're analyzing everything. We created a

418
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,959
[ __ ] paper tier list that we're

419
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:54,560
utilizing pasted to our wall. Shut the

420
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,120
[ __ ] up. Are you kidding me? You shut

421
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,680
your [ __ ] ass up. These like bros

422
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,920
analyzing our videos. Take a look at the

423
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,959
wall. All we're missing is strings and

424
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,039
pins.

425
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,720
We're halfway to detective status, you

426
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,439
[ __ ] freak. Are you serious? Oh,

427
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,799
giving me [ __ ] You printed this [ __ ]

428
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,319
out. I'm just saying you're yapping

429
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,880
about it like it's a video. Chill out.

430
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,400
Holy smokes.

431
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,919
Joking. You're joking now. Oh, who is

432
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,079
you? I like you on. It's her grandma.

433
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,080
All right. Best video ever. Oh, who is

434
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,799
you? It's her grandma.

435
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,520
I love that baby. Danielle, stop it. Oh,

436
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,880
who is you? I'm your grandmother. Lean

437
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
back. Acting like you going to get up

438
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
and do something. Get up and do

439
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,799
something then. Do you remember Bobo and

440
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,799
Coco? Who?

441
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,480
Oh my god. No, we never said that on the

442
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,679
video. I know, dude. These are the

443
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,400
scariest looking people on Earth.

444
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
Seriously, this is like a mega. be

445
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,720
scary. You, Matt, and Chris always joke

446
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
around cuz there's this one video of me,

447
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,679
Matt, and Chris were like I don't I

448
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,160
don't know what we were doing. We were

449
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,559
like explaining something else. I just I

450
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,520
had like red hair. Matt's wearing tie

451
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,559
dye and wearing like the baggiest like a

452
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,640
really tight pink hoodie. Imagine Matt

453
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,679
like a full literally had a full throat.

454
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,919
We looked the worst we've ever looked in

455
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,520
our lives in that video. What is that

456
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,360
video? I don't remember. Where did you

457
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,760
put I think we were like also editing on

458
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,799
a new software and it like mixed the

459
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,600
mess just like my hair.

460
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,840
I look like I got beat up.

461
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,080
My god, I look worse than you. You do

462
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,840
look awful. This might just look like a

463
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,480
photo of Jason Tatum. But if

464
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,240
you right between his legs

465
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,000
now hold the [ __ ] That to me is

466
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,559
incredible Bostononian moment. This I

467
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,919
have to say like us going to the Celtics

468
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,520
game and working with them to make

469
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
content and then and them gifting us

470
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,720
stuff and being able to sit courtside

471
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,720
bring two of our best friends ever. This

472
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,960
was an incredible incredible Yo yo

473
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,039
Incredibles. That's Teeter. That's the

474
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,039
Teeter line. Incredibles like Yeah.

475
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,640
Right there. Yeah. No, that right there.

476
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,280
See, I'm not even a big sports fan, but

477
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,360
what a Boston experience. I was bleeding

478
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
on the jumbotron. It was Yeah. That

479
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,760
said, Sternolo's triplets is you guys

480
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,000
name. Yeah. So, this is when I went on

481
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,080
stage with Skies. Wow. Someone tweeted

482
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
it and said, "Is that Chris Sternolo on

483
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,960
stage with Skies?" Wow. And he confirmed

484
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,160
it by saying, "That's the bro on

485
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,520
Twitter." Wow.

486
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,039
That incredible moment for young

487
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,919
Christopher. Yeah. I mean, the cowboys.

488
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,240
Honestly, the 7 mil vid was so fun and

489
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,039
celebrating 7 mil with our cowboy, our

490
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,720
horse friends. But the zoo video is

491
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,200
better. And I don't know when we're

492
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,400
going to hit 8 mil, but I hope to top

493
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,960
the zoo video and the cowboy video. What

494
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,960
a great I think that the cowboy video

495
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
and hitting 7 million subscribers was

496
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
major, but we could have went more all

497
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,280
out. We could have went more all out for

498
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
7 mil. I'm going to I'm going to do

499
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,200
this. It's self-deprecating and it's

500
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,440
putting ourselves down. But I think this

501
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,120
is a major mid teeter line to be honest.

502
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,880
I completely agree with you. And I will

503
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,960
say though, the only thing that makes me

504
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,200
want to bump it up to major more is cuz

505
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,520
video aside, I felt connected with

506
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,600
nature and the animal and I had an

507
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
overall great experience. I don't think

508
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,080
that I would have ever had besides

509
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,480
YouTube. I think that's major. When

510
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,840
Julia Ernst confirmed that her and Matt

511
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,039
never dated, I will I will say this is

512
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,080
going in the video. I will say that this

513
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,799
was incredible. A major clarity point

514
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,159
for me. Yeah. Finally. Thank you, God.

515
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,080
You know. Yeah. No hate. No hate. But

516
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,640
like, come on. What are we doing?

517
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,799
Rumors. Rumors. I love rumors. I love

518
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,120
rumors. I think that everyone we should

519
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,440
like start. I want to be hated on. I

520
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,080
want rumors. I want lies spread. You

521
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
know, every source of media. I'm dating

522
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,919
this person. I hate this person. Me and

523
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,400
this person aren't friends anymore. I'm

524
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,600
best friends with this person. I love

525
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,679
rumors. I love haters. Hate on me. Lie

526
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:19,440
about me. Let's do it. The last one. No.

527
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,520
The sterno triplets product campaign and

528
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,600
trip to Italy. First time overseas for

529
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Matt and

530
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,200
Chris. I think that was incredible. I

531
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,559
think it was an incredible experience. I

532
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,799
think I looked the best out of the three

533
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,400
of us. I think that it was really fun

534
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
working with such a major brand. Going

535
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,120
on a trip with you guys was so fun. Such

536
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,760
a pivotal career moment and something

537
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,440
and enjoy. I think that this is it. I

538
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,960
think that this is a really good

539
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,320
demonstration of just everything. I

540
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,320
really do think that it makes sense.

541
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,200

542
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,960

Um, and let us know if you like the tier

546
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,559
lists, what you want us to tier list in

547
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,080
the future. Like, do you want us to tear

548
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,919
your legs? Like Matt in this yellow

549
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,320
hoodie. Stop. Incredible. Stop. Stop.

550
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,360
Stop. Matt with a beer. Incredible. Nick

551
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,120
in the stripes. Mega mid. Chris's jokes

552
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,720
on the floor. Terrible. One name for

553
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,280
mega below. Mega mega mega mga mega.

554
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,280
That's mid. That's mega mega mid. That's

555
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
it.
