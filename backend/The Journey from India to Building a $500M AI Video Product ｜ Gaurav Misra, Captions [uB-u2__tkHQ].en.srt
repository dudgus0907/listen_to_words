1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
I grew up in India. I had no idea or no

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,440
concept of like what is Boston? What is

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
New York? I hadn't been to any of these

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,400
places. Boston generally is a very

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,679
multicultural environment. People come

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
there from a lot of different countries

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,200
and I went to Boston University where

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,719
that's especially the case. After

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
graduating from college, I actually

10
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,960
started a PhD in machine learning which

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
I actually dropped out of. I left my PhD

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
program and I joined a startup. People

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
thought I was crazy that I would just

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,760
drop out of it and get kind of go join

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,039
some startup, right? But I think it was

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
the right decision looking back at it.

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,720
It was a very high-risisk decision, but

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,239
it worked out. Especially in the US, and

19
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
I think that's what makes the US such a

20
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,480
special place. There's definitely so

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
much opportunity that I think it's

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,760
better to be a little bit more of a

23
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
risk-taker. Most of the time, you can

24
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,079
take a risk and actually get rewarded

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
for it. I think people don't bias enough

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
towards taking risks. If you just do

27
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
what everybody else is doing, then

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,280
you'll just end up wherever everybody

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,280
else is going, right?

30
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,079
My name is Goraf and I am the co-founder

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
and CEO of Captions. Captions is a video

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
creation company. Our goal is to make it

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,400
easy for anybody anywhere to be able to

34
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
tell their story through video without

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
actually going through the physical

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,240
process of recording or editing a video.

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,720
We've raised over $und00 million in

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,479
funding. It's gotten to tens of millions

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,479
of users and over 100,000 plus users

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,479
daily.

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
I was in the US for the first four years

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,400
of my life and my parents moved to

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,479
India. I grew up in India. Moving back

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,119
to the US like I had no idea or no

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,880
concept of like what it would be like.

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
What is Boston? What is New York? Like I

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,479
hadn't been to any of these places. My

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,920
parents were like Boston's great you

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,600
should go there. And I was like sounds

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
great. Let me do that. So at Boston

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,920
University it was an interesting

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
situation because coming from India sort

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
of the curriculum there especially

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
around computer science is just very

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
advanced compared to the US and a lot of

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,119
the things that we actually were being

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
taught in college we had already covered

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,880
in high school for the most part. A lot

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,719
of college classes were essentially

60
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,159
repeating what I had already done in

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,680
high school. It probably was the case

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
for a lot of people from India I

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
imagine. I think that did give me a

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,280
chance to actually go and explore

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,280
outside of just that and kind of see

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,200
what else I can learn and what more I

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
can do. I did tons of projects. I like

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
worked on projects with my roommates. I

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,120
worked on a lot of different apps that

70
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,680
we launched and this was like in 2012

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,440
2011 when the app store was still early

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
in high school and going into college. I

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,360
had started a kind of a company in a

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,280
strange way. I say that because I

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
actually didn't realize it was a company

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
until much later. I was working on some

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,879
games and there was some need around

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
like security software for those games

79
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,480
and I decided to make it and the game

80
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,879
company decided to buy it for me not

81
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
knowing that I was like 16 years old and

82
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,599
I ended up selling it to a bunch of

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,959
other companies as well. I didn't

84
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,560
realize at that time that this is what a

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
company is is like you make a product

86
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
you sell it but much later I was like

87
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
wow that's kind of what it was. It was a

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
interesting sort of experience to go

89
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,599
through because it kind of transitioned

90
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,160
from generally games and gaming into

91
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,879
sort of more general skill set. I really

92
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,879
enjoy learning new things. How do you

93
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,319
learn things quickly and how do you

94
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,920
figure things out quickly? It's

95
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,360
something that not a lot of people talk

96
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,519
about, but it's like one of the most

97
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
important skills in my mind. Go to a new

98
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,120
domain, you know, go to a new area,

99
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,959
something that you haven't done before,

100
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,879
try for the first time, figure it out

101
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
quickly, and be actually useful and

102
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,080
productive in it is like it's a pretty

103
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
cool skill and it's pretty fun one to

104
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,959
work on because you get to try out a lot

105
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
of different things. You'll get to learn

106
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,400
a lot of different things and focus on

107
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
that as a skill in itself. Being able to

108
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,530
do all those different things and

109
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,680
figuring those things out is really

110
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,680
[Music]

111
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,640
important. Through the early part of my

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,040
career, I was really focused on machine

113
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,200
learning as a central aspect of what I

114
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,360
was doing. At Microsoft, I joined them

115
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
on this new team they were developing

116
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
called Azure Machine Learning. It's like

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
a machine learning platform they were

118
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
building. And then at Snapchat, there

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
was a bit of a difference. I got a

120
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,560
chance to really get more on the product

121
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,959
side and eventually ended up joining the

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,040
design team which was like a huge shift

123
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
from what I had done previously and the

124
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,519
idea of like connecting technology to

125
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
actual design and actual product made a

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
lot of sense. So I ended up starting a

127
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
team there called design engineering

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,879
which was like how do you bring together

129
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,799
great design and great engineering to

130
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,479
build amazing products right? One of the

131
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,799
things I learned at Snap, if you think

132
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
about Snap as a company, I think Snap

133
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,800
was one of the earliest companies to

134
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
actually get into video for consumer use

135
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,000
cases, especially short video. It did

136
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,759
get me very immersed into the space of

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
like video in general, especially video

138
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
for communication, short videos, and all

139
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
the challenges both technical and

140
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,280
product that are related to that. But I

141
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
think in general, one of the things that

142
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,919
I noticed was essentially a shift in the

143
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
way that people were communicating. A

144
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,800
lot of people thought Tik Tok was just,

145
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
oh, Tik Tok, that's like just people

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
dancing, right? It's for fun. But I

147
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,639
think the reality was that yes, there

148
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
were a bunch of people dancing, but

149
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,120
there was a lot of people talking and

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,440
there were a lot of people telling

151
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,639
stories and, you know, sometimes bad

152
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
things that happened to them, good

153
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
things that happened to them. People

154
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,360
were like talking about ideas and like

155
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,440
what could be done and what should be

156
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,120
done and people were arguing with each

157
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,720
other, right? And I think that was like

158
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
a shift in the way people communicated

159
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
from like that's the type of stuff that

160
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
would happen like on Twitter or like on

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
text beforehand, right? and it was now

162
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
happening on video for the first time.

163
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
So, I got pretty familiar with all the

164
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
different ways that people are

165
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
communicating and kind of what works

166
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,400
better and what doesn't

167
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,800
work. When we started the company, we

168
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
were thinking about building a social

169
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
network and so we were thinking, okay,

170
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,840
there's like a distribution part and

171
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
then there's a creation part of the

172
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,680
social network. We thought, hey, let's

173
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
start with the creation first. So we

174
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
started off with the idea of literally

175
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,919
just adding captions to videos, text on

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
videos based on what people are saying.

177
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
The reason we did this is because we saw

178
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360
there was a big accessibility movement

179
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,080
at that time. There were a lot of people

180
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
sort of manually writing text on top of

181
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,000
their videos and it was spent an hour

182
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
like typing it all out. There wasn't

183
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
actually a solution for this that was in

184
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,960
the market at that time. So we were the

185
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,520
first ones to build it and the absolute

186
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,560
first project we built it in one weekend

187
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,800
just as like a test essentially and we

188
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,120
put it on the app store and the next day

189
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,960
we woke up and it was like 600 people

190
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
per minute using it basically it was

191
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,360
completely at the top of the app store

192
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,039
with no marketing no nothing done

193
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,479
essentially and I think that was like

194
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,160
the moment where it was like wow it

195
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
can't be this easy right like it really

196
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
can't be because we had been told right

197
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,680
like it's going to be a lot of work to

198
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,000
find product market fit and things like

199
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
that. But I think that being said, we

200
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,120
had just started the company and we had

201
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,319
this idea of a social network and things

202
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,080
like that. I think we were like, "Okay,

203
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
this is working, but I wonder if we

204
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
should go back and like really think

205
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,919
about the social network aspect of

206
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
this." And so we tried to figure out how

207
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,120
to get people to post on the platform

208
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,199
and things like that until we

209
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
essentially rediscovered captions. And

210
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
this was a interesting moment where we

211
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,800
were working on another application

212
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
which was called Spam App. It was like a

213
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
photo sharing app. It was actually doing

214
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,360
really well. While we were working on

215
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
that, we're looking at the bills and

216
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,120
there was like a good $10,000 a month

217
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
going to captions. You know, I remember

218
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
talking to my co-founder and we were

219
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,560
like, "Okay, let's just delete it

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,639
because we don't want to spend $120,000

221
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,960
a year on this, right?" We decided to

222
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,080
delete it. I remember going back home

223
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,840
and on Saturday going through like, you

224
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
know, the UI to be like, "Okay, I'm

225
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,280
going to press delete now." And while I

226
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
was going to press delete, I was just

227
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,120
thinking, "Ah, but like we worked so

228
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,039
hard on this. Like I don't want to

229
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
delete this, right?" Like it's like I

230
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,599
want to keep it for memories at least,

231
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,840
right? So I had an idea just in the

232
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,319
moment quickly design a little payw wall

233
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,919
where we ask people to pay for the app.

234
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,599
If nobody pays for it then it's

235
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,360
essentially shut down but we can

236
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,199
continue using it because you know we

237
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,919
work hard on it and if someone pays for

238
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,400
it then it pays for itself. So we're not

239
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,880
paying the bills basically. So I quickly

240
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,720
made that in about 2 or 3 hours put it

241
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,879
on the app store and launched it and

242
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,639
then completely forgot about it. So, we

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,199
continued working on spam app and it

244
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,160
continued growing through the next, you

245
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,400
know, four, five, six months. While we

246
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,479
were doing that, I for some reason

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,199
decided to check my account. And when I

248
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,199
checked it, it was like at $500,000 or

249
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,759
more and growing. And like the craziest

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,840
part was not only did people pay for it,

251
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,919
people retained on it. And it was

252
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
growing in revenue completely on its own

253
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,199
with like zero employees working on it.

254
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,360
So, no employees. There were like 2,000

255
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,479
open support tickets. Nobody was

256
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,240
answering obviously, right? And it would

257
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
continue to grow. You know, we had to

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,880
have this like tough conversation of

259
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,279
like, oh my god, like this is truly

260
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,279
working, right? And it was tough because

261
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,279
we already had another thing that was

262
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,440
also working and that we were raising a

263
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
new round on essentially, right? I think

264
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,000
we discussed this for a couple of weeks

265
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,600
and we ended up deciding we're going to

266
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
switch to captions and we're going to

267
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,279
just focus on creation as the primary.

268
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,680
We switched over and literally the

269
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,920
moment we launched the first set of

270
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,959
features on top of the existing app.

271
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,640
What was looking like a fast growth

272
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,360
completely condensed because the new

273
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
growth was exponential just like

274
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
straight up. I mean, I think that's kind

275
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,120
of the crazy thing that I think about at

276
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,440
this point is like that split-second

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,959
decision was the difference between two

278
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
completely different paths. Here's the

279
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,440
thing, like we don't know. The other

280
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
side could have been even more

281
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
successful. That's the tough part about

282
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,160
these decisions is like you have to

283
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
choose one and you'll never know what

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,839
the other could have been. I think the

285
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
big decisions are actually in the small

286
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
decisions in a way and the small

287
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,480
decisions are what actually you don't

288
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,399
think about too much but actually turn

289
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
the tide of like what will happen in the

290
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,440
future. I think that was the case over

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
here too, right? Because like what felt

292
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,200
like a very small decision of like other

293
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,640
app should we delete it or not seem like

294
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,760
kind of obvious. Anybody we would have

295
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
asked would have told us, yeah, just

296
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,920
delete it, right? Whatever. But I think

297
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
those small decisions actually are way

298
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,279
more important than the big ones

299
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
sometimes. And I think this shows quite

300
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,240
a bit like if you look at any

301
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,000
competition at a global scale, right,

302
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
which building a startup is kind of a

303
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
competition at a global scale. Like look

304
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
at the Olympics for example, right? Like

305
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,080
people are like within seconds of each

306
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
other, right? Sometimes even

307
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,760
milliseconds of each other. That's not

308
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,040
because of some major decision they made

309
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
while training or something like that.

310
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,720
Everyone's very good, right? It's

311
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,399
probably like some minor micro decision

312
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
that happened in the moment like, you

313
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,240
know, while they're swimming and they

314
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
moved one arm at this angle versus the

315
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
other angle. Like that's what's deciding

316
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
who wins and loses, right? I think it's

317
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,040
like those small decisions that count

318
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,040
the most.

319
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
We did face challenges around like

320
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
identifying the user and making sure

321
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,839
we're building for the right user

322
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
because when we launched the app like it

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,160
was immediately sort of successful,

324
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
right? And it immediately blew up. It

325
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,600
made things easier and harder in some

326
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,320
ways. I think one of the things that can

327
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,360
happen when too many people join sort of

328
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,200
your app or product very quickly is you

329
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,640
kind of lose lose sight of who the

330
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,920
customer is because there's a lot of

331
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,279
people who are just checking it out.

332
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
There's a lot of people who don't

333
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,480
actually care about the use case, but

334
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,839
they want to just see what's going on.

335
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
Between all that noise, it's difficult

336
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
to figure out like which one of these

337
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,120
people are the actual user. Who's going

338
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,880
to retain and for whom is this actually

339
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
solving a real problem? That's really

340
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
important because at the end of the day,

341
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
without focusing on the right customer,

342
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
you'll end up building the wrong

343
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,959
product. Captions was a paid app from

344
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,720
the beginning. And I think elements

345
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,120
there that was interesting is like being

346
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
paid actually helped filter our user

347
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,640
base a little bit and to only those

348
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,920
people who were willing to pay. Those

349
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,399
people that were willing to pay were

350
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,079
people who had real pain point. And so

351
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
with that, we got really good feedback

352
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
from users, right, around like what we

353
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
should build and what we should

354
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
prioritize and what they want from us in

355
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,320
the future. We decided to keep the app

356
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
paid right from the beginning all the

357
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,160
way till today because of that reason. I

358
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,320
think on the technical side, we try to

359
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,240
avoid as much as possible technical

360
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
challenges that it's sort of unproven

361
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
essentially, right? Like I think one of

362
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
the mistakes that can be made is like

363
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
spending a lot of time building

364
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,360
something very technically complex

365
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,959
without fully recognizing whether

366
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
there's product market fit there or not.

367
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,920
We spend a year building something and

368
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
nobody wants it. Right? That happens

369
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,600
very often and it's happened to us too.

370
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,279
The key factor there is like how do you

371
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,279
reduce the technical risk to like an

372
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,880
MVP? How do you test with like just the

373
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
bare minimum? Get something out in front

374
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
of people. Have them see it. Have them

375
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,760
try it. If they don't retain, then don't

376
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,279
invest more in it, right? Try something

377
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
else. And I think that's the other thing

378
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,600
is like not going deeper and deeper into

379
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,519
the rabbit hole almost in a way. I think

380
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,680
there's also tendencies of like building

381
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,000
the first version seeing that it doesn't

382
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
completely work and then justifying it

383
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
by saying well if it only had this

384
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
feature and that feature and that third

385
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,120
feature then maybe it would have worked

386
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,959
right but I think the reality is like it

387
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,639
would not probably not have worked with

388
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
as many features as you want. It would

389
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,079
only have worked with a single feature

390
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
only one of those things right whatever

391
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,200
actually people want at the end of the

392
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,040
day. So, I think the better skill is to

393
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
just learn how to quickly build stuff.

394
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
Try as many things as possible. The most

395
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
important thing is getting stuff out in

396
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,560
front of people, testing it. If it

397
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
doesn't work, kill it and start again.

398
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,160
And keep doing that as quickly as

399
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,160
possible.
