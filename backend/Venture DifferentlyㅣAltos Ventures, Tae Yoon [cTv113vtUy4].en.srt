1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,080
there are three core principles that are

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,600
really important elements of what Jack

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,160
Todd he was regarded as the West Coast

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,559
War buffit so the first thing is around

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,000
the power law in any asset class there

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
are only a small number of companies

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,840
that drive all of the returns the second

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
one is around compounding the

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,920
compounding of value of these special

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,800
assets happened in years 10 15 and 20

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,960
not in years 1 2 and 3 and then the last

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,960
idea is around this notion of a hedgeh

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,920
talk my name is Tay I'm a partner at

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,760
Altus Ventures so Altus is a venture

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,480
capital firm that was started here in

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,000
Silicon Valley in 1996 as a firm we are

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,520
Global generalist Tech investor so it's

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,280
a very wide and flexible mandate we

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
really focus more on the orientation and

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,160
alignment with the founders who we work

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,239
with I actually think we are more like

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
life cycle investors you can think of us

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,040
as early stage investors typically

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,159
leading series A's and after that

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,360
initial investment we take a very

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,280
long-term approach to company building

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,520
and investing literally thinking in

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,320
decades rather than years we love

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,960
partnering with Founders who also have a

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,720
similar mindset of building these

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,720
durable businesses over a long period of

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,880
time and we have a lot of flexibility

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,680
and capacity to further support those

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,920
businesses through additional

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Investments as time goes on there are

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,920
many cases in our history where we would

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,920
start very small and early with the

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,479
particular company and then end up

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,960
investing hundreds of millions of

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,240
dollars in addition to the initial check

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,200
along the entire journey of the

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,759
companies I do spend a lot of time

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,960
meeting and investing in software

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,040
companies software happens to be a

45
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,200
business model that is very Capital

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,159
efficient it actually is also a very

47
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,360
durable business because the world

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,799
continues to get digitized and software

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,399
is playing a very large part in helping

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,439
with that digitization it actually meets

51
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,880
our general criteria of long-term

52
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,079
company building Capital efficiency

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,640
pragmatic company building and software

54
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,840
companies exhibit a lot of those

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,840
characteristics that maybe makes it a

56
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,640
really good fit with what we are doing

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,640
uh at the broader

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,720
level so in 1996 when the firm was

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,040
started we had One Singular LP and the

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,440
idea was to invest in SE stage very

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,440
early stage startups and then feed them

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,599
to the very well-known Silicon Valley

63
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,840
BCS to come in and mark them up and lead

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,360
the series a so ho and Han were

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,680
classmates from Stanford GSB they

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,159
started Altos back in 1996 I think in

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,920
the early days when we thought we were

68
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,319
good we were fairly smart enough to lots

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,120
of interesting business ideas and we

70
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,760
realized that as long as we got the

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,840
founders of these companies to make a

72
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,760
bit of progress on management hiring and

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,760
potentially offer themselves up to a to

74
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,760
be very open to getting a CEO into their

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,879
companies as long as we got them

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,760
prepared and we put that package

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,120
together we took it to a the larger

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,599
Venture funds they would mark up the

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,239
price and invest in a high valuation

80
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,040
they put the new CEO in then the bankers

81
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,319
start showing up and the companies were

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
ready to go public and it was literally

83
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,519
like that during the bubble days of

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,040
internet and so we obviously thought

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,640
that was the formula for being a very

86
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,040
good venture capitalist that worked

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,599
until it didn't in 99 2000 many of these

88
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,840
companies go public crazy high

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,640
valuations everyone looks really smart

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,200
and then literally all of our companies

91
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,480
went to zero and I think that gave the

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,000
team and the founders Insight that wow

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,360
like the way we were doing it was just

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
wrong there is no real value creation

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,640
who cares about markups when the

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,000
eventual number is zero so I think they

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,959
went back to the drawing board and we're

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,239
trying to get back to the fundamentals

99
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,640
like why do we invest and who should we

100
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,439
invest behind and how do you ultimately

101
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,480
create value and build these durable

102
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,000
businesses and I think that's when the

103
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,920
Warren Buffett Charlie Munger thesis

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,480
comes into play with the help of

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
Professor Jack

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,359
McDonald I actually met ho and Han back

107
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,919
in 2015 when I was at Capital G Google's

108
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,240
growth Equity Fund one of the partners

109
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,639
who I worked closely with Jean France he

110
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,240
and ho and Han were all classmates from

111
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,400
Stanford GSB so through that

112
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,919
relationship we looked at a few of Al's

113
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,360
companies including toss and roadblocks

114
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,320
ultimately couldn't get there on either

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,680
of them uh which was a big mistake and

116
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,039
then I just always felt like they were

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,880
really good people and so we always

118
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,680
stayed in touch and then when I went to

119
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Stanford for my own business school

120
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,520
experience I took a class called the

121
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Investments class I was taught for 50

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,960
years by this famous Professor Jack

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,400
McDonald he was regarded as the West

124
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,320
Coast Warren Buffett I was sitting in

125
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,840
the classroom and ho and Anthony just

126
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,440
walked in and I was like wow what are

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,759
they doing here and it turned out that

128
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,919
Jack was a very important figure and

129
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,800
adviser to alter when alus got started

130
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,880
there are three core principles that are

131
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,360
really important elements of what

132
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,120
taught so the first thing is around the

133
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,960
power law so in any asset class there

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,120
are only a small number of companies or

135
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,400
assets that drive all of the returns if

136
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,280
you look at the public markets you would

137
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,000
look at companies like apple Google meta

138
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,680
and so forth that have driven almost all

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,240
the returns of the S&P 500 over the last

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,560
several years this is even more

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,520
Amplified and more true in the world of

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,800
venture capital where only a small

143
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,960
number of companies in every Vintage

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,039
Drive all of the returns the second one

145
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,199
is around compounding there's this

146
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,800
really simple and classic example of

147
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,400
should you take $1 million of cash up

148
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,240
front or should you take a penny that

149
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,680
doubles every single day until the end

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,919
of the month and of course the answer is

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,319
you should take the penny because it

152
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,880
turns out that even in February when you

153
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,880
have 28 days that Penny ends up becoming

154
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,919
more than a million dollar at the end of

155
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,039
the month if you're lucky enough and you

156
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,680
are in a leap year and you have 29 days

157
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,319
in that February that becomes 2.5

158
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,280
million plus and then if you're super

159
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,400
lucky and you're in a month like January

160
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,240
with 31 days it's over $10 million at

161
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,120
the end of the month and so we believe

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
that a lot of the value that gets

163
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,360
created for a startup and a company

164
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,880
happens in those latter years when the

165
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,479
base gets much bigger and the value

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,639
keeps acur in a durable way so that's

167
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,599
why we try to be extremely patient I

168
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,919
think uh Roblox is probably the most

169
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,599
well-known example of a company where we

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,479
first partner with Dave and the team 16

171
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,759
years ago when we LED around with a 1.5

172
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,440
million doll investment and up to the

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,960
pre-ipo Round We invested another

174
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,039
hundreds of millions of dollars into the

175
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,680
company and so we were of course a

176
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,960
larger shareholder when the company went

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,319
public and in some sense we view this

178
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,639
still as an early stage company there is

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,879
so much that the companies building and

180
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,080
a lot of potential to further grow the

181
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,919
business from here on in some sense We

182
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,479
Believe in this notion of the infinite

183
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,160
game and that's the game that we want to

184
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,960
play which has no time bound because the

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,840
compounding of value of these special

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,120
assets happen in years 10 15 and 20 not

187
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,160
in years 1 2 and 3 selfishly we want to

188
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,120
generate wonderful returns and we should

189
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,759
be super

190
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,000
[Applause]

191
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,599
patient and then the last idea is around

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,400
this notion of a hedgehog there's this

193
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,000
Jim Collins analogy from the book good

194
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,960
to great about Hedgehog Founders versus

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Fox Founders we have a blog post on our

196
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,520
website as well and Hedgehog Founders

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,440
are people who are maniacally focused on

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
trying to solve one problem and trying

199
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,120
to do that really really really well

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,599
foxes are extremely smart very cunning

201
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,319
but they often have a lot of things

202
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,879
going on they have a lot of projects

203
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,440
they're quite distracted and for us we

204
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,199
gravitate towards the Hedgehog Founders

205
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,840
people who feel like this is their

206
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,240
life's work and something that they want

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,960
to endure through the ups and downs and

208
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,360
we've experienced

209
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,879
that those types of Founders are the

210
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,800
ones who can endure the difficulties of

211
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,720
a startup Journey no startup journey is

212
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,240
linear and up to the right all the time

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
there are a lot of challenges that come

214
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,639
and being that Hedgehog founder we feel

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,039
like is an important ingredient to

216
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
building something great over a long

217
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,199
period of time I think even within our

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,400
team we have slightly different views on

219
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,560
what a hedgehog founder means and how do

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,319
you identify someone as a hedgehog

221
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,400
versus a fox in some sense it's a

222
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,440
spectrum so it's very difficult to say

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,120
well you're a fox and you're a hedgehog

224
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,159
it's a spectrum of how Hedgehog e are

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,440
you versus how foxy are you I find some

226
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,080
of the best Founders and often times

227
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,399
they are these hedgehogs to have very

228
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,120
strong opinions but loosely held so the

229
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,920
strong opinions come from either an

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,399
inherent connection to the industry or

231
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,080
the problem that they're trying to solve

232
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,800
and that was the Genesis of why they

233
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,920
started the company to solve their own

234
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,040
problems so there's one bucket of

235
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Founders who come in that category but

236
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,720
then there are are other Founders who

237
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,200
also become extremely entrenched into an

238
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,640
industry or a problem through a lot of

239
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,680
studying and a lot of conversations and

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,560
more of a top- down approach to trying

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,000
to figure out how do you solve this

242
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,120
problem that I want to solve and in

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,959
either case the best Founders seem to

244
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,320
have at least a strong point of view on

245
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,760
what the world should look like and I

246
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,680
think that's very important because you

247
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,560
have to be a Visionary to change the

248
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,360
world or bring to the market a service

249
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,040
that did not exist before at the same

250
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,200
time what's really interesting about a

251
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,920
lot of the Founders is that these

252
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,040
opinions are loosely held so they're

253
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,480
strong but they're willing to change

254
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,240
their views if they see something new or

255
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,680
if they learn something new and that

256
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,120
part is also really important in our

257
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,480
view because you have to have the mental

258
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,040
plasticity to figure out whether you're

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
right or wrong about something and have

260
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,560
the humbleness to admit when you're

261
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,040
wrong that you have to course correct

262
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,160
and so this is where the continuous

263
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,320
learning mindset comes into play and the

264
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,160
best Founders and the best Learners tend

265
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,040
to have that characteristic I've been

266
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,519
working with and partnering with a

267
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,920
number of vertical Market software

268
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,920
companies one company is called push

269
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,440
press which is a gym management software

270
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,800
company we first led the series a two

271
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,680
and a half years ago what they're trying

272
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,880
to do is to provide the best software to

273
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,920
Independent gym owners across the US and

274
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,279
across the world the founders were

275
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,519
former CrossFit gym owners they had a

276
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,720
paino of finding a software tool that

277
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,320
work for their own gym so the founder

278
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,680
who had a technical background just

279
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,519
built a software tool for his own gym

280
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,920
that ended up becoming push press now

281
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,880
they have about 100 people at the

282
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,800
company of which the majority were

283
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,360
former gym owners or former Fitness uh

284
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,480
professionals they live and breathe the

285
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,360
category the industry that they serve

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,959
and it shows in the way they approach

287
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
customer support and the way they talk

288
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,839
to their customers that's been a really

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,320
fun Journey so far a lot of Founders

290
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,519
would come and say we are looking for

291
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,880
the next 10-year type of partner we're

292
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
very serious about finding the right

293
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,519
partner it's not about valuation oh and

294
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,079
by the way we need a term sheet by

295
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,040
tomorrow that's very hard for us because

296
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,320
how do you get married after the first

297
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,959
date and we view the partnership as a

298
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,440
marriage and so we really appreciate

299
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,120
having the time to get to know Founders

300
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,000
and get to know each other and I think

301
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,720
that is actually really important to

302
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,440
building a very long-term and fruitful

303
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,680
relationship because let's say you enter

304
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,320
a relationship without having that

305
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,200
alignment well in the first board

306
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,639
meeting or that second date it's going

307
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
to be very apparent that this is not a

308
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,519
good fit and what's the point of that if

309
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,480
the goal was to build a generational

310
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,480
company for 10 plus

311
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,600
years I have one definition or one

312
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
analogy that I personally really like I

313
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,240
was at my son's preschool and there was

314
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,360
a teacher parent conference where the

315
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,440
head of the school was giving a speech

316
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,399
to the parents and she made this analogy

317
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,200
of you parents know your child the best

318
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,160
we teachers know children so if we

319
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,600
partner well together it can be an

320
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,200
extremely fruitful partnership and a

321
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,079
symbiotic relationship and I was

322
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,120
listening to that and I was like hm

323
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,880
that's kind of like my job as an

324
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,800
investor there is no way that we as

325
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,040
investors and Venture capitalists would

326
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,839
know a singular company more than a

327
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,760
founder or the team that's working hard

328
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,120
at it but we do see a lot of companies

329
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,279
and we end up working with a lot of

330
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,639
companies over the years and that

331
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,279
pattern recognition or the sheer amount

332
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,199
of data that you can aggregate of seeing

333
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,279
the good ones the okay ones the bad ones

334
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:44,680
the full gamut of company building

335
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,720
allows us to hopefully provide guidance

336
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,240
when it's needed for these businesses to

337
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,680
avoid mistakes or accelerate their path

338
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,880
to Greatness and so in some sense maybe

339
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,519
I was thinking to myself a venture

340
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,079
capitalist is like a preschool teacher

341
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,560
where you're trying to be a helpful

342
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,240
Steward but you should also be humble

343
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,320
enough to know that there is so much

344
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,000
more to that singular child or company

345
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,680
than what you probably see so you have

346
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,240
to respect that and work with the parent

347
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,120
or the founder to understand it as much

348
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
as you can and then with that context

349
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,800
and the partnership you can provide the

350
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,680
insights and the support to hopefully

351
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,160
accelerate that path what we are trying

352
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,480
to do is of course to not be average and

353
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,160
hopefully add value and maybe the way to

354
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,480
add value to a company's trajectory is

355
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,760
increasing their odds of success again

356
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,600
the success is still unclear whether you

357
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,880
can succeed or not as a company as a

358
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,639
founder or even as investors there's a

359
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,800
lot of inputs that go into that eventual

360
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,760
outcome which hopefully is great but

361
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,360
there's luck and there's a lot of other

362
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,560
circumstances that have to go your way

363
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,600
for that to happen so then what is it

364
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,120
that we can do well we can definitely

365
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,600
control the inputs to getting there and

366
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,440
hopefully the partnership with a venture

367
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,079
capitalist or an investor is a strong

368
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,399
partnership that allows the thinking to

369
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,720
keep expanding and for the VC to help

370
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,759
Steward and guide the company in a

371
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,920
direction that increases the odd of

372
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,600
success so I really like that framing of

373
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,839
the role as

374
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,560
well belus is a totalitarian state I

375
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,720
wanted to be free the guy worked in it

376
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,600
advised me if you get that job you will

377
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
be free free you can get out of barus

378
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,839
you won't be dependent on rules of the

379
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,639
country where your parents are where

380
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,800
your relatives are and and you looking

381
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,120
to get free so that works that totally

382
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,120
works
