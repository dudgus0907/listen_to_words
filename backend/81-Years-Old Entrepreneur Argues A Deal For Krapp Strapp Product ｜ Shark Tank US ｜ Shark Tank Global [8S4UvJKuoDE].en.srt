1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,920
First into the tank is a solution for an

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,920
inconvenient problem in the great

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,920
outdoors.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,160
Good morning, Sharks. I'm Bob Le and I'm

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,480
Keith Lindsay and we are Airboss

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,519
Outdoors and we're from Jacksonville,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,399
Texas and we're here to ask you for

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:34,800
$65,000 for a 10% equity in our

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,680
necessities product business. At our

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,719
boss outdoors, we design and develop

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,520
innovative solutions to some of those

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,280
age-old problems that outdoorsmen have

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,440
experienced for years. In the outdoors,

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,480
you go out and you relax and you have a

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,239
good time. But there's always there's a

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,870
number one problem relieving yourself in

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,440
the woods.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,199
[Laughter]

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,960
We've developed the number one necessity

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,960
for doing number two outdoors.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,760
Let me introduce you to the crap strap.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,920
That's good.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,280
allows everybody a comfortable doing the

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,200
deuce outdoors.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,880
Wait a minute now. Doing the deuce out.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
You can see how it works. You just

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,000
simply attach it around your waist.

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,200
Attach it to a strong structure like a

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,079
tree or even a fence post. Uh you could

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
use the bumper on a vehicle even.

32
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,200
You simply lean back and let it fly.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,520
What the hell? And relieve yourself.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Oh, Bob, I was worried we're going to

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,600
see everything there. I tried to get it

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,600
on TV, but I couldn't get there.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:14,879
It It will take and hold 400 lb. It's

38
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:19,520
got two pockets, each one on each side.

39
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,920
toilet paper, corn cobs, leaves, or any

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,520
other thing you want to put in it. Now,

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,959
how many of you

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,520
onehanded can take a piece of toilet

43
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,480
paper and make it into a nice wipable

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
piece of equipment while you're hanging

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959
on to the tree? You're still hanging on

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,239
to the tree. Let's say you get through

47
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,160
that. Well, you got to finish up the job

48
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,120
onehanded. M well let me just tell you

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
onehanded and you don't do enough and

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,400
you leave a residual it's going to itch

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,400
when it

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,599
dries back now by God the reason you're

53
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,760
laughing is cuz you've been there. No,

54
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,440
it's so true, right? So true. Right.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,280
True.

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,519
Now, Sharks, we've come a long way from

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,159
Jacksonville, Texas. And we honestly, we

58
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,519
came here today to make a deal with the

59
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,319
Marco, Texas. Get up here, Mark. Go

60
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,480
demonstrate. Mark, no one drops a deuce

61
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,800
better than me. You know, my man, Bob.

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,440
Yes, sir. Why do you say it holds corn

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,360
on the cob? Cuz anything you want to put

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,319
in it to do the wiping job, people use

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,599
the corn cups. What? Oh my god. Where

66
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,000
are you from?

67
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,159
All right, Mark. Hey, wait a minute.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Move it down on his waist a little bit

69
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
and pull your feet. Pull your feet

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
forward. Come on. All the way in, Mark.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,599
All the way in. Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,080
Go. No, Mark. Mark, like Lori would tell

73
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,840
you, knees up. Squatty potty level. I I

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
need the knees like way up there, baby.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,200
Squatty potty like a dog. Like all knees

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,790
way up there. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,920
[Music]

78
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,080
[Laughter]

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,319
This is great. Mark, do you feel like

80
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
you're seated? Like comfort. It's

81
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,079
comfortable. It actually works. Yeah,

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,199
it's comfortable. That's cool. So, I

83
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,320
have to find out about you. I'm 81 years

84
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,639
old. I'm a young relationship, dude. I

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
got to watch one. I can bend my knees,

86
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,240
but then I can't get up. And was this

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,280
your first invention? No, ma'am. Our

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,440
company started with motion decoys.

89
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,000
What's a motion decoy? When you put

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,040
decoys out, I go duck hunting. What do

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,840
they do? They just They just sit there.

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,880
Right. Right. Well, I put a motor in

93
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,639
them so they'd move and the ducks would

94
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,160
say, "Hey, dude. There's someone down

95
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,280
there. Let's go.

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Anyway, uh I sold the company and it

97
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,600
whatever and then about three four four

98
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,040
years back got associated with Keith

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,199
whom I have known for 30 years and we

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,880
developed an outdoor business. Okay,

101
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
let's talk about sales. Has anybody

102
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,600
bought the crab strap? Yes. The

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,960
crabstrap went on the market in October

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,000
of last year. Yeah. Okay. With zero

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,440
advertising dollars spent. Y last year

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,600
we sold approximately 4,000 units

107
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,400
between October

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,520
how many dollars? Every unit went

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,919
through our e-commerce website. How much

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,800
it charge for it? $49.95 each. What does

111
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,880
it cost you to make it? $50. Wow. 200

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
grand worth of craft straps in four

113
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,280
months. What does it cost you to make?

114
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Cost $17. And and it was no advertising

115
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,840
whatsoever. No advertising. How did

116
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,160
people know? Was it your existing

117
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,560
customer? Oh, no. Don't know. How did

118
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,160
they know? I'll tell you exactly. July

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,240
the 1st, he put it online just just

120
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,600
for one social media post by me. That

121
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,840
was on the first. That's a Friday,

122
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Tuesday. It had been seen by a,200

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,120
people. And we had a list of wild and

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
bully. So, can I ask you what what do

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,160
you need the money for? I want to be

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:27,280
clear about our intentions for your

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,880
$65,000. Okay? You know, the people that

128
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,800
have been really successful at

129
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:37,440
marketing, e-commerce, social media,

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,520
advertising, we have tried some of that

131
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,000
and we waste money. Okay. We try on

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,000
that. We we waste money on that. So, we

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
get it. So right now what you're saying

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,759
is that you want to take the money and I

135
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,639
guess the partnership to do the sales

136
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,080
and market. Exactly what we want. A

137
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,540
partnership. Go ahead. I want to part I

138
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
want to have some fun.

139
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,160
[Music]

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
You know, I think it's so inspiring to

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,039
see you here creating products and

142
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,840
building a business. Bless you. And I

143
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,919
think it's a great product because sales

144
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,280
don't lie.

145
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,520
and you've got sales. We did. But I will

146
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,639
not be going on the crap trap journey

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,039
with you. It's not for me, but I wish

148
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,479
you all the best. I'm out. But there's

149
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,639
four other sharks and one from Texas.

150
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,800
Well, thank you, Keith and Bob.

151
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,039
Fantastic presentation and right to the

152
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,199
point. I was a camp counselor as a

153
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
teenager and I've had my rear end bitten

154
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,919
by mosquitoes while doing number two.

155
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
And that's why I have a new motto for my

156
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,720
life. Every night I have to sleep

157
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,319
somewhere where there's a mint on my

158
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,360
pillow. That's how I work. I I think

159
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,120
this is a fantastic product. You think

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
about products on Shark Tank for 15

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,479
years. No, there's never been a crap

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,080
strap. Never. Ever. And it works. But

163
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,080
guys, I'm not your Shark. I'm out.

164
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,240
We appreciate you, Mr. Kevin. Keith and

165
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,400
Bob, I think that um I'm actually

166
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,960
interested. I'm one of I think I'm the

167
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,879
only outdoors person here, but I'll be

168
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,599
very honest. Uh there's another shark

169
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,919
here. She would be interested because

170
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,560
she happens to have been in this space

171
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,240
in different categories. Squatty Potty.

172
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
Uh I think he has some other products in

173
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,440
this area. I'm asking if I can get

174
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,759
another shark in on here if she's

175
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,000
interested. I I I will go in on it with

176
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
you. I'll clear the I'll clear the deck

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
because I wanted to make sure you guys

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,159
got an offer because you'd be fun to

179
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
work with. But Damon's the outdoor shark

180
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,479
and he understands better than I do. So,

181
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
I'll go out and if their deal is nasty,

182
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,880
then I'll come back in.

183
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
So, what are you guys gonna do? What do

184
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,680
you have? Wait, they're getting ready.

185
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,360
You got to stop selling.

186
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,040
Okay. So, Damon and I discussed this. We

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
realize you need a lot of help with a

188
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,720
lot of things. Yes, we do. Thank you.

189
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,640
Damon and I are going to go in on it,

190
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,200
but we want to be more equal partners to

191
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:09,080
you. You came in asking for 65,000 for

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,959
10%. We're going to ask for

193
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,959
65,000 for 35%.

194
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,640
[Music]

195
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,480
Ichi wawa kamba. It's not bad.

196
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,160
There you go. There you go. So, we will

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,120
collectively own one/3 and I'm assuming

198
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,120
45% and be done with this.

199
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,399
Give us a little bit of room. Yeah,

200
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,399
let's 33 and a3. Damon loves that

201
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,399
number.

202
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
Bob, we're there. We're done. We're

203
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,080
done. Congratulations, guys.

204
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,000
Well done. Well done. Now you two can

205
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
say you help people do the deuce

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
outdoor. Do the deuce outdoor. Thank

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,320
you, man. You did great. You did great.

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,800
Thank you. I love you, too, man. All

209
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,399
right. Thank you, brother.

210
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,560
Now, you didn't take a crap while we

211
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,560
were here talking, did you? Damn it.

212
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
How did you

213
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,480
know? Bob, you're a star, buddy. You're

214
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,120
a star. Thank you. We love you. It's

215
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,480
going to be so much fun. Oh my god. Oh

216
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,200
my god. Good job, Bob. You go, boy.

217
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,800
We'll all make some money. It's fun.

218
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,800
They enjoyed it. I loved it.
