1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,640
too many of the same projects doing the

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,439
same thing just about money just about

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,719
Finance I think myself and my team wish

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,519
we didn't have to be associated with

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,639
most of the people in the industry what

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,440
you see when you go to conferences most

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,600
of what people are talking about is

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,400
either nonon or incredibly dull

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,800
development dollars could have been

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,199
better spent on improving the technology

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,720
blockchains need the ability to handle

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,920
much more data and more computation this

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,679
means that people can build rules that

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,320
say you wanted to create a truly

15
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,160
uncensorable Twitter a way to do this

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,719
would be using a blockchain but you

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,920
couldn't handle all of the users and

18
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,920
data so you need to take that do that

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,360
computation somewhere else if I could

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
Truly find the score of a two-player

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,440
matchup I can create a betting Market

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,360
between the world's largest Gamers

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,879
people started using Bitcoin in places

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,399
like Venezuela to hedge out insane

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,960
inflation there's not too much you want

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,440
to do actually on the blockchain there's

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,239
not too much you can do on the

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,920
blockchain hi my name is Hugo fillian

29
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,320
and a co- and CEO of flair Flair really

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,080
is the only blockchain which we describe

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,920
as third generation it enshrines data

32
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,200
directly into the chain first generation

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,159
being Bitcoin simple transactions second

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
generation being ethereum adding logic

35
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,720
to those transactions third generation

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,079
flare adding data to the logic has just

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,600
hit about a million wallet 100 to

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,640
150,000 daily active users so they're

39
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,439
bringing value from other blockchain

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,159
ecosystems to flare to be used on flare

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,360
with the data provision services that

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,840
are provided by FL within the blockchain

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
environment you shouldn't be doing

44
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,399
anything based on trust because you

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,799
don't know the counterparty and you

46
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,799
don't have any legal recourse

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,119
essentially what defi is doing today is

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,479
it's using a trust-based model which is

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,040
very similar to trafi except is that

50
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,280
trafy are bound by laws whereas an

51
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,479
oracle provider has no laws in order for

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,759
defi or any other application that

53
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,560
relies on data to be valid you need to

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,479
have a way to secure those oracles that

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,960
is clear open and provides a similar

56
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,119
sort of safety as the blockchain itself

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,039
we think the best way to do that is to

58
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,599
put the oracles fundamentally into the

59
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,599
chain bring defi actually

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
decentralized I grew up in London which

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,239
is pretty much the world's Financial

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Center at the time when I was growing up

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,959
very small startup Community very little

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,440
technology Community the financial

65
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,440
markets were the only choice and

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,160
obviously a place where one could

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,239
potentially make large amounts of money

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
which is very interesting to think about

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,440
when you're 17 I suppose the

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,280
macroeconomic and that's always been a

71
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,080
things I like to think about so I

72
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,000
studied risk and financial engineering

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,080
worked at a number of hedge funds in

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,840
London after about 7 years I decided

75
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,440
that I was just trying to eek out

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,920
Financial returns in order to make uh

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,120
essentially myself richer so I left

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,519
Finance went studying machine learning

79
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,239
at UCL in London and that's where I met

80
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,920
my two co-founders and I knew knew I

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,239
probably wanted to be a founder and when

82
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,640
looking at machine learning it's heavily

83
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,959
dominated by very large companies and

84
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,680
therefore gives you no opportunity

85
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,640
really if you look at open AI he ran y

86
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,519
combinator I certainly didn't have

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
anywhere near his Network to do anything

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,239
in machine learning one of our

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,519
co-founders had built inter vehicle

90
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,319
Communications based on a distributed

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,440
Network like Bitcoin and I'd had some

92
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,360
exposure to blockchain from people I

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
knew in the financial Community

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
ultimately it was a very interesting

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,040
idea to me that we could do everything

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,760
especially Financial things without

97
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,760
having to care about the counterparty

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,239
and I think that was one of the

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,439
fundamental reasons why blockchain at

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,480
the time and still does promising

101
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,920
technology so we started flare in 2018

102
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,159
and we had a very small office in the

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,079
basement someone's photography studio

104
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,519
but as we were a team of three I think

105
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,920
one and a half desks at the time they

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
didn't enjoy the benefit on ethereum of

107
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,879
smart contract essentially the largest

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,680
source of Bitcoin was know as wrapped

109
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,280
Bitcoin which is managed through a

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,239
custodian essentially antithetical to

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,280
the concept of Bitcoin meaning you're

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,879
relying on a middleman in order to use

113
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,239
your Bitcoin on a smart contract

114
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,079
platform we started looking at okay well

115
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,079
how can we get the data around Bitcoin

116
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,280
we devised the protocols to be able to

117
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,560
get that data from Bitcoin to build a

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,560
bridge that is over collateralized

119
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,039
meaning it has more value securing it

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
than than the amount of Bitcoin that has

121
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,919
been bridged using that bridge and in

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
order to do that we needed price so we

123
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,039
ended up with these two data protocols

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
the first being a protocol that allows

125
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,479
you to quickly and securely get data

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,280
from another blockchain and also to be

127
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,160
able to prove that a particular thing

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,800
hasn't happened on that blockchain and

129
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,800
that's pretty

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,720
key so originally we designed the data

131
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,600
protocol just to be able to build this

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
bridge for Bitcoin ultimately we very

133
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,680
quickly realize that there those data

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Protocols are much more interesting that

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,800
we could bring in data from any open

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
system pretty much any system in a

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,720
decentralized way that's the key point

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
it's decentralized and it has security

139
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,960
so this allows you to do everything you

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,639
can do in defi today but with Flare

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,440
that's just the first step what really

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,440
interests me is then okay what can we

143
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,039
build with that this means that people

144
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,960
can build rules of an application

145
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,520
they're building second aspect is then

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,840
for us off chain compute far more data

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,160
from other sources than can be used by

148
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,479
the chain so where are you going to use

149
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,840
that very very large amounts of data

150
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,960
that you need to be able to use that off

151
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
chain in order to build applications so

152
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
I think the blockchain today is at the

153
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,639
limit more or less of what can be built

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,960
until you add in further compute and

155
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,720
that's when we can start building

156
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,520
applications that people actually want

157
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,960
to use so for me the first and most

158
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,880
interesting thing to do is genuinely

159
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,639
decentralize and make uncensorable

160
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,280
social media or news platforms or video

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,720
platforms we see an increasing set of

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,680
issues in the world where there is very

163
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,039
High censorship where people are

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,039
struggling to express their opinion

165
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,880
another set of application is around

166
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,440
gaming ultimately the experience the

167
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,000
blockchain has offered to gaming has

168
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,280
been so inferior to the web 2 or

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,800
existing gaming product it really hasn't

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,840
taken a tool but there are interesting

171
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,160
things you can do when you essentially

172
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,160
financialized components around gaming

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,680
if I can truly understand what has

174
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,800
happened at in each computational step

175
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,360
of a game then I can give people skins I

176
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,120
can give people asset based on exactly

177
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,479
what they've done and those assets can

178
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,840
be real and tradable as opposed to

179
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,280
Simply ingame I do have a third thing

180
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,919
there suppose the last area that really

181
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,919
interests us as a team uh is probably

182
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,840
machine learning or as most people call

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
it artificial intelligent there are some

184
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,800
very interesting things you can do with

185
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
distribution of users again there's a

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,400
there's not too much you want to do

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,520
actually on the blockchain there's not

188
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,720
too much you can do on the blockchain I

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,240
suppos the decentralized and

190
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,479
economically secure substrate of a

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,919
blockchain provides a very interesting

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,759
place for machine learning to be

193
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,919
expanded and to be made safer through

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,919
having multiple

195
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,000
participants some people may believe

196
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,280
that Bitcoin shouldn't have value and I

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,120
understand that mentality you have to

198
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,000
differentiate between the technology and

199
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,360
the value it has some logic to it

200
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,440
Bitcoin is only backed by hashing power

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,039
in it's not by the ability to Levy taxes

202
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,120
nor is it backed by the ability to force

203
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,160
other people to use your medium of

204
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,199
exchange Bitcoin doesn't have either of

205
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,039
those two things but perhaps it has one

206
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,000
other thing rather than forcing people

207
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,479
to use your medium of exchange but to

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,840
get them to voluntarily use it and

209
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,520
that's interesting but you'll never

210
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,440
convinc people that don't want to be

211
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,879
convinced especially as an awful lot of

212
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,240
people have a reason a financial reason

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,680
not to be convinced about that thing if

214
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,199
you take away the it's a monetary asset

215
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,240
side of the equation it's fairly nent

216
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,000
technology I think being able to

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,400
distribute computation and consensus

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,039
will become more and more useful over

219
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,240
time essentially there is value in being

220
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,639
able to come to consensus cross some

221
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,960
item of data across various different

222
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,440
vertical you know our biggest space the

223
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,560
space we're most interested in

224
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,879
researching thinking about is around the

225
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,879
outputs of machine learning models

226
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:33,120
probably provides the answer to what is

227
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,760
blockchain useful for my exposure to

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
finance was really post the large

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,240
financial crisis the ideas around what

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,680
something is worth fall apart when

231
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,360
currency is printed people were making

232
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,959
trades based on an expectation of

233
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,560
government action rather than based on

234
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,680
any fundamental strength in the economy

235
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,920
the sort of large excess of capital that

236
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,680
was put into the markets host the GFC

237
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,120
really led to a position where where

238
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,720
valuations were massively out of whack

239
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,640
and so when you spend your days thinking

240
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,040
about the idea of taking the fundamental

241
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,839
thing that values assets is a very

242
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,240
interesting thing because it removes

243
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,279
that ability of a group of people to

244
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,920
pervert essentially the entire

245
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,040
transmission mechanisms of all financial

246
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,200
markets and that's what has happened the

247
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,200
idea that could be a technology that

248
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,040
removes that from the equation is very

249
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,160
very appealing people started using

250
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,680
Bitcoin in places like Venezuela to

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,360
hedge out insane inflation that was

252
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,519
collapsing their currency crypto broadly

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
has solved the question of how can I

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,040
move dollars across the world really

255
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,640
quickly and easily without having to

256
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,480
enter an iban the defi that is built

257
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
fundamentally around essentially a

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,800
dollar based stable coin system and

259
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,399
Native tokens because that's essentially

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,800
what defi is and I think that could

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,360
expand as people use crypto tokens more

262
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,519
whether it be stable coins or the native

263
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,160
so if we're lucky flare will be one of

264
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,680
the key components in how people use

265
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,920
data on blockchains that's what we're

266
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,800
building that's essentially where we're

267
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,279
going we're not a smart contract project

268
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,480
focused on Ripple we have a much much

269
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,200
larger ambition and that ambition

270
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,120
revolves around data and offchain comput

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,000
so in 5 years time I'd like to see a

272
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,720
non-trivial percentage of the data that

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,680
is used in blockchain being sourced from

274
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,680
Flair regardless of whether it's being

275
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,560
used on flare as a chain or whether it's

276
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,720
being used on ethereum or any other new

277
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,399
chain that comes up success to me would

278
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,120
be that the data came from flare moved

279
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,760
from flare in 5 years it's feasible that

280
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,560
our offchain compute strategy could

281
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,959
result in applications that go Way

282
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,399
Beyond defi Way Beyond having value for

283
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,040
speculative reasons and much more

284
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,440
involved in people's daytoday lives

285
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,279
because it's a valuable application in

286
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,279
and of itself for
