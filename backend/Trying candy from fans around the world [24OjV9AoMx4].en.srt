86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,660
better than us because I'm giving it

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,860
foreign

106
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,820

no it's a better Eminem it's way better

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,860
and you know why it's thinner because no

119
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,840
because in Europe they don't have excess

120
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,060
of like they don't have XL things they

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,220
don't have like you can't get a fat ass

122
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,600
bag of cereal in Europe they don't do

123
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,940
that [Â __Â ] because they have portions

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,740

125
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,800
bags of milk that's why no one's right

126
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,940
