86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,660
better than us because I'm giving it

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220

88
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,320

it was like whatever we see what it

104
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,860
looks like it tastes like that it's a

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,860
foreign

106
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,820

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,680
right on the head yeah it could be a

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,039
taste tester you're good at it great

116
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,500

no it's a better Eminem it's way better

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,860
and you know why it's thinner because no

119
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,840
because in Europe they don't have excess

120
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,060
of like they don't have XL things they

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,220
don't have like you can't get a fat ass

122
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,600
bag of cereal in Europe they don't do

123
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,940
that [ __ ] because they have portions

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,740
it's crazy you know in Canada they have

125
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,800
bags of milk that's why no one's right

126
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,940
like they put their milk it's like swear

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,139

128
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,039
