1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
I think startups are basically like

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,319
getting slapped in the face probably

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,640
over and over again. That's basically

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,400
it. I also, you know, interestingly, I I

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
actually like failures a lot. One of the

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
things I hate the most is doing

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,880
something and not knowing if it's

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
working or not. And it's actually very

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,160
it's very freeing to know when something

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
fails because that's very obvious. I

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
like when decisions are obvious. Like

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,720
when something fails, it's obvious you

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
need to do something new. And the faster

14
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,519
you fail, actually, the faster you can

15
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
decide to do something new. And I think

16
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,039
for a company like us, like we're at the

17
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,560
frontier of the technology, we should be

18
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,080
imagining we are failing at a lot of

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,519
initiatives. In fact, if everything is

20
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,800
working, we're operating at less than

21
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
potential of the company. We should be

22
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,440
failing. Like that probably means we're

23
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,120
not betting. We're not taking enough

24
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,559
bets if we're not failing enough. I I

25
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
think it's like a required part of a

26
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,800
company that you that you fail. I'd say

27
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,559
like be more humble about your ideas.

28
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,079
And I wouldn't say that I was arrogant

29
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,079
at the time, but probably a lot more

30
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
idealistic about our ideas being

31
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,680
correct. And you need some amount of

32
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
idealism as I said before, but at the

33
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,920
same time, it's that there's no reason

34
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,920
why an idea is great if you haven't like

35
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
validated it. be honest with yourselves

36
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,719
about, you know, the viability of your

37
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
idea and be willing to pivot very

38
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
quickly. I feel like a lot of a lot of

39
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
founders hate the word pivot, but it's

40
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,360
it's awesome. Like, it's awesome. You

41
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
know, what sucks more is like doing the

42
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,479
wrong thing and just failing. Even right

43
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
now, I would say one of my regrets is

44
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,960
probably not doing the pivot 3 months

45
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,640
earlier.

46
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
Hey, I'm Verun, CEO and co-founder of

47
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,360
Windsurf. So, Windsurf is an AI powered

48
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
ID uh that provides agentic capabilities

49
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
that enables developers and

50
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,119
non-developers to build apps really

51
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
quickly and also modify existing

52
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
applications really quickly. A million

53
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
developers have actually used the

54
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,920
product. We have hundreds of thousands

55
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,600
of monthly active users on the on the

56
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,520
product right now and it's growing, you

57
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,040
know, exponentially faster with time.

58
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,479
So, I graduated from MIT in 2017 and

59
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
after that I actually worked at an

60
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,560
autonomous vehicle company in Mountain

61
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,320
View called Nuro. there sort of got an

62
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,720
early taste of what deep learning could

63
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,880
do for other industries. Started the

64
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,720
company actually in 2021, so it's been 4

65
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
years. At the time, the company didn't

66
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,799
do anything relating to code AI. It

67
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
actually built out GPU virtualization

68
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
and compiler technology. We did that for

69
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,880
over a year and a half and were able to

70
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,799
get to a couple million in revenue. We

71
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
had eight employees at the time. One

72
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
thing changed very very materially in

73
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,599
that time. In the middle of 2022, GPT

74
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,959
3.5 came out at that point and we

75
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,879
thought that generative models would

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,560
fundamentally transform many different

77
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,480
industries and we needed to make kind of

78
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,840
a pretty big decision at that point to

79
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,440
pivot the company because we

80
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
fundamentally felt everyone was going to

81
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
run generative models for everything.

82
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,720
And at that point we believed a lot of

83
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
the value would acrue to companies that

84
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
were applications almost like in the

85
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,879
early days of the internet the companies

86
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,720
that proved to be very valuable were

87
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
companies like Google and Amazon and we

88
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
wanted to see what would it be like if

89
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
we could build the next Google or

90
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Amazon. We were early adopters of a

91
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
product called GitHub Copilot and from

92
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
there we actually built out a product

93
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
called Kodium which was an extension

94
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,879
that lived in all the major IDEs and we

95
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
were able to get that to over a million

96
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,400
users as well. Um, and we ended up

97
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
serving some of the world's largest

98
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,160
enterprises, companies like JP Morgan

99
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080
Chase. Very quickly though, sort of

100
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,280
middle of last year, we realized that we

101
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,879
needed to control more of the

102
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
experience, especially as these models

103
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,879
became more and more agentic. And that

104
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,720
was why we decided to build our own ID,

105
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,510
which was Windsurf. That has taken off

106
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,680
very quickly as well.

107
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,879
[Music]

108
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,400
It's actually kind of interesting. I

109
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
think MIT is very different than

110
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,239
Stanford. I think most people don't go

111
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
to MIT to kind of immediately start a

112
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,599
company. I don't think my aspirations

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,920
were to start a company. I did

114
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,319
progressively intern at smaller and

115
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,959
smaller companies. So I first interned

116
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,400
at LinkedIn, then after that Quora uh

117
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
and then data bricks. Data bricks at

118
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
that time was a very small engineering

119
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
team. They were not even a unicorn at

120
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,640
that time. But I think I didn't actually

121
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
end up working at any of these companies

122
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,720
because I think the thing that motivated

123
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
me was can I be a meaningful part of a

124
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
visionary company working with motivated

125
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
people. That's always been what's driven

126
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,440
me and that's sort of why immediately

127
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,959
after MIT I decided to go work at an

128
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,120
autonomous vehicle company. I thought

129
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,840
that could be the future of where just

130
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,519
robotics was going to go and I think for

131
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
me and probably the other people at the

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
company we want to work on the future of

133
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,599
technology and that's what truly

134
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,360
motivates us. I think the motiv is just

135
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,200
how do you build products in hard

136
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,799
technology spaces where the technology

137
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
is not there yet. You know I I'll give

138
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
like a quick just some interesting

139
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
numbers. You know, when we started,

140
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,720
obviously, deep learning was was pretty

141
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
popular. Uh, but the amount of compute

142
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
that these models had access to grew

143
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
exponentially year-over-year. You know,

144
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
just some numbers here. In 2017, the

145
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,880
number of teraflops on a consumer grade

146
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
GPU was 10. By the end of 2022, it was

147
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,520
actually 700. So, it's a massive

148
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,840
increase of in compute that happened.

149
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
And I think what we learned was machine

150
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,600
learning models were going to get more

151
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
capable very quickly. And you should not

152
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
bet on where the technology is today,

153
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
but where it could be a couple years

154
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,400
from now, right? And if all you're doing

155
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,919
is working on products that work today,

156
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
you're going to be quickly irrelevant a

157
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,280
year from now. And that was like a very

158
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,960
important lesson that we I think a lot

159
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
of a lot of people that were in the

160
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,759
autonomous vehicle space kind of

161
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
learned, which is now if you were to

162
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,720
look at autonomous vehicles, they're

163
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,639
much more machine learning based than

164
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,160
they were probably 5 or 6 years ago.

165
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
Originally, we started out the name of

166
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,199
the company was Exaf Function. Part of

167
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
the reason why we called it exunction

168
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
was our goal was to virtualize GPU

169
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600
computations to make it easier to run

170
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
things on GPUs. And the the term exa

171
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
function means we want to run an exa

172
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,639
number of functions which is 10 to the

173
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,120
18 functions. I think the biggest

174
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,440
learning lesson for us was at the time

175
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
was even if we were succeeding by some

176
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,000
metrics we were making some revenue just

177
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
accepting that hey like the business

178
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,520
might not be the best business and we

179
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
need to go pivot was a very hard thing

180
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,199
to do I would say right it's very hard

181
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
when you have like employees you know

182
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
you've already raised some amount of

183
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,520
funding I think at the time we had

184
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
raised over $28 million of funding to

185
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
basically start from scratch overnight

186
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
uh but one of the learning lessons that

187
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,400
I've sort of had and probably the other

188
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
people at the company is every time you

189
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
do a pivot you have an opport

190
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
opportunity to maybe 10x the size of the

191
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,400
company. And uh usually when you have an

192
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,000
idea that you don't believe in and the

193
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
ceiling is low, it's actually better to

194
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
just scrap the entire thing than to like

195
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
try to incrementally claw and you know

196
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,120
increase the value of what you're doing

197
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
by like you know 20 30%. It's not going

198
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,880
to matter in the grand scheme of things.

199
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
So we had gone to a couple million in

200
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,440
revenue at that time. I think the hard

201
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,280
part for us was it felt very ad hoc how

202
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,360
we were adding revenue to the business.

203
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
It also felt like with the advent of

204
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
these generative models, a lot of the

205
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,039
complexity of running models would

206
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,800
become commoditized. If everyone is

207
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,720
going to run transformers, uh the

208
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
transformer model architecture, what is

209
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
the reason for us to have a platform

210
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
that virtualizes arbitrary GPU

211
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
computations? It's not as important

212
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
anymore. So, it's a factor of two

213
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
things. We didn't understand how we

214
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,919
could 10 or 100x sales, right? I think

215
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,199
you build a company not to make a couple

216
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
million in revenue, but billions of

217
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,319
dollars in revenue. So we didn't

218
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,000
understand how to even get within an

219
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
order of magnitude of that right that

220
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,280
was one and two we also felt that the

221
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,560
problem we were solving with the advent

222
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
of the generative models was going to

223
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
get commoditized. So at that point it's

224
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
kind of an easy thing once you believe

225
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,960
that something is not going to be big

226
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
you have no other option but to change

227
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,720
your mind and do something new that is

228
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,800
very painful because you did commit a

229
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
lot of time and a lot of energy and

230
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
passion to one thing. You don't win an

231
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,840
award for doing the wrong thing for

232
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
longer. I guess me and my co-founder did

233
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,120
a walk over a weekend and I guess we

234
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
decided over a weekend and we told the

235
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
team on Monday. Um and then everyone

236
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,919
started working on the new thing

237
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
starting Monday. Uh yeah, I guess we

238
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
just you know one of the core beliefs

239
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,440
that we have about startups is startups

240
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,360
can if they're lucky do one thing really

241
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
well. We could not afford to have the

242
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,319
company believe two things were

243
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
important. So we would need to rip the

244
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
band-aid off and actually make it very

245
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,120
clear to the rest of the company that

246
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,960
the new thing was where we thought the

247
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
future was. You know, it's interesting.

248
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,919
I would we were not worried at all when

249
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
we did the pivot. We had basically

250
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
written off the company is going to be a

251
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,199
zero and at that point anything is

252
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
greater than zero. Ship whatever you can

253
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,120
if it sucks you're in the same place

254
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,479
that you are. If it doesn't suck like

255
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,319
great awesome only upside just honesty,

256
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,560
transparency and int like intellectual

257
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
honesty with the team is maybe a core

258
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
tenant of the company. We don't do

259
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
things unless we like truly believe they

260
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,599
are the right thing to do. even if it

261
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
like fits some narrative that the rest

262
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,639
of the industry or our investors or

263
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,639
convenient belief we believe things if

264
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,120
from first principles they're correct

265
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,800
and you know I guess one true fact was

266
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
after telling our employees there's a

267
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
real chance that some of them would

268
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
leave but I think like when you build a

269
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
highquality culture where the people are

270
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,720
are intellectually honest um good people

271
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
don't want to leave if you if you chart

272
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,720
a path for what the thing that does work

273
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,080
is right because you know one

274
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,000
interesting thing about startups is

275
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
people talk a lot about moes. What's the

276
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,039
mode of a company? But really, what is

277
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
the mode of a company that has 10

278
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,960
people? You know, if you do have a moat,

279
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
it's very shallow at best, right? The

280
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
number of engineering years that went

281
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
into your product is already very small.

282
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
So, the real moat is you work on the

283
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
right thing with enough people for long

284
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
enough. That's like the only moat a

285
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
startup ultimately has. And that's like

286
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
why you believe in a team. Obviously,

287
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,240
when a company becomes thousands of

288
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,760
people, hopefully the moat is not the

289
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
current business. It would be sad if the

290
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,440
moat was the company can just pivot and

291
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
do the next thing. In that regard, I

292
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,839
think if you genuinely believe the

293
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,320
motive of a of a company is betting on

294
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,080
the right things and and hiring a great

295
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
group of people, then if you are

296
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
intellectually honest with your team and

297
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
tell them we don't believe in the

298
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,200
strategy we just had, it's should be

299
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,200
totally fine with everyone.

317
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,080
I think we were early adopters of a

318
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
product like GitHub copilot. So we and

319
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,839
we were we actually built a lot of

320
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,519
infrastructure. So at the time we

321
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
thought that was the tip of the iceberg

322
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,480
of what the technology could actually

323
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,880
build. We thought a lot more could be

324
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
built in this category. Right? If all

325
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,080
people were doing was autocompleting, we

326
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,080
could potentially see a world in which

327
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,000
entire PRs would get generated. And at

328
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,600
that time, we were like, okay, the time

329
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
it takes to build applications probably

330
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
has gone down by a double digit percent.

331
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,160
Why don't we set the goal of the company

332
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,399
to reduce the time it takes to build

333
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,920
technology by 99%. It's a very ambitious

334
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
goal, not something we'd be able to do

335
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
in the next year or two. But if we set a

336
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
very ambitious goal, there's probably a

337
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,720
lot of work to be done in this space. We

338
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,160
believe that technology is always going

339
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
to get better. We believe the models are

340
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
going to get better. Because of that, we

341
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,720
just believed there was a lot of

342
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,079
opportunity here. Because we were also

343
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
an infrastructure company at the time,

344
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,760
we were able to train our own models and

345
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,360
run models ourselves, which enabled us

346
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,160
to build an extension that was entirely

347
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,600
free in all the major IDs. And uh that

348
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,040
was able to very quickly get to hundreds

349
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,640
of thousands of users. It was a

350
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,079
combination of what our skill set was,

351
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,000
also a belief of where we thought the

352
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,399
future was going. I think it took us

353
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,320
less than 2 months to build the MVP and

354
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,480
ship it out. I think as a company we're

355
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,560
probably more of the opinion of if you

356
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
are going to do something hard um it is

357
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
actually important to have intermediate

358
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
goals that you can actually give to

359
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
other people to validate your

360
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
hypothesis. That's maybe something that

361
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
we learned a lot of us at the company

362
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
were previously from autonomous vehicles

363
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,640
and I think one of the biggest mistakes

364
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
that autonomous vehicle companies might

365
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,279
have made is maybe to no fault of their

366
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,880
own was they built a hard technology

367
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,640
where it's very hard to validate if the

368
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,560
technology is good in the middle. Right?

369
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,320
So for us it's always been it is

370
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,120
actually a feature if you can have a

371
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,360
very very like visionary goal but have

372
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
very tractable intermediate steps and so

373
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
we actually picked a very tractable

374
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
intermediate step to deploy which was

375
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
can we build a basic VS code extension

376
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,920
that had autocomplete capabilities uh

377
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,519
with our own model and that was that was

378
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,360
the intermediate goal that we had and we

379
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,800
believed you know maybe it was like a

380
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
little bit of necessity we just pivoted

381
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,240
the company people were not working on

382
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,480
anything else there was an existential

383
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,040
dread what the value of the product was

384
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
so we very quickly built it. I think a

385
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
basic form of product market fit was

386
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
when our inbound for the product from

387
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,399
like companies was was more than like

388
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
any of us could handle and we did need

389
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,519
to hire a real go to market team. I

390
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
think at that point we realized hey

391
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,279
we're actually solving a real pain for

392
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
the market and we are providing a lot of

393
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,639
value. So that was that happened very

394
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
quickly like within months of the

395
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,000
product coming out we had a lot of

396
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
companies reaching out to how could they

397
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,160
run the product uh for themselves and

398
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
and use it for their large code bases.

399
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,120
Yeah, I think the word product market

400
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,279
fit is probably something I don't like a

401
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
lot because it it creates a lot of like

402
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,880
overconfidence. I think what what you

403
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
have as product market fit in one day,

404
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
if you don't continue to innovate and

405
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
you have competitors, is very quickly

406
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,959
going to become a commodity where you

407
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
don't have product market fit. So, you

408
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,480
need to be very paranoid. I always like

409
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,920
to tell the company we're probably going

410
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,200
to fail. And I think the good thing

411
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,680
about telling the company we're probably

412
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,160
going to fail is it creates enough sort

413
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,399
of energy in the company to find the

414
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,160
next thing that keeps you as a

415
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
differentiated product and and survive

416
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,000
in a in a space. But I think in general

417
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,839
like product like I feel like if you

418
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,760
have pull from the market, it's very

419
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
hard to fake it. It's it's very obvious

420
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
when you have it and very obvious when

421
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,320
you don't. And I'll tell you this like

422
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
even when we were making a couple

423
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,440
million in revenue with the GPU

424
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
virtualization business is very obvious

425
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,959
we didn't have product market fit. It's

426
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,959
not a scalable company. you don't really

427
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,959
understand how you can grow revenue and

428
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,200
find find a way to like provide more

429
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,720
value at scale. So very quickly I think

430
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
a lot of large companies were starting

431
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,240
to reach out to us for a variety of

432
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,760
reasons for security reasons because we

433
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
were able to run models ourselves. We

434
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,360
were able to run it in a secure way. The

435
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,120
other thing is they wanted the systems

436
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,040
to work with their complicated sort of

437
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,959
code bases. Right? Their code bases are

438
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
not simple. Some of our customers have

439
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,320
tens of millions of lines of code in a

440
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
single codebase. and we started building

441
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
more and more technology to make it

442
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
possible that we would give very

443
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
personalized suggestions to them

444
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,480
regardless of where they stored their

445
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
code. I guess very quickly we started to

446
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
get to 100 customers. It went from going

447
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,320
from zero to 100 customers probably

448
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
within months um at the company. I think

449
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,519
the feedback that was kind of

450
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,839
interesting to us is how important just

451
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,279
small details were right to the entire

452
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
user experience. We started off as an

453
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,079
infrastructure company and we needed to

454
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,079
kind of become a product company which

455
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,680
is a big kind of change. You know basic

456
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,519
things like the latency of the product

457
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,959
how quickly we provide suggestions was

458
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,720
quite important. You know just basic

459
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,160
things if we do too much computation on

460
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,079
the user's machine and it kind of like

461
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,079
makes the machine too slow that's a

462
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,199
unacceptable user experience that is not

463
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,959
something we would think about if we

464
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,399
were purely a server-based application.

465
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,480
So there were kind of new things as a

466
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,680
company we needed to learn because the

467
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,360
space we were operating in was

468
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,360
fundamentally different. I think

469
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
basically what happens is once a company

470
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,920
gets bigger it's possible that you start

471
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
losing the reason why you had a good

472
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,680
product to start with right you start

473
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,920
listening actually in some ways too much

474
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,839
customer obsession might be bad in that

475
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,600
if you do things that all of your

476
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,360
customers ask you to do sometimes you

477
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,120
might like incrementally iterate to

478
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
actually build a really bad product and

479
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,079
it's actually better off to completely

480
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,240
change the paradigm in a way that your

481
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,000
customers don't really ask for because

482
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
you you suspect it could be helpful. So

483
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
there's like a little bit of a healthy

484
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,040
amount of don't just listen to random

485
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,639
people about what you should build.

486
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Listen to your customers, but don't

487
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,920
listen to your customers in how you

488
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,360
should build it. There could be a way

489
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,959
you could build it in a way that is very

490
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,399
transformational, but not something that

491
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
they would even expect. One of the

492
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,680
things about our product is we have a

493
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,199
pretty large individual product and we

494
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
have ways in which our users can

495
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,760
communicate with us, you know, either

496
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,000
online on social media. Uh, and I guess

497
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,519
I I look through it fairly frequently to

498
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,519
understand what the pain points our

499
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,880
users have about the product. Also at

500
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,480
the same time I guess like everyone at

501
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,920
the company uses the product almost

502
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,279
day-to-day which is maybe a unique

503
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
aspect of the product right there are

504
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,120
probably a lot of AI tools out there but

505
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,800
the people building the tools are not

506
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,480
using them all the time whereas the

507
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
people that build our products literally

508
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
use our product to build the product

509
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
whether it be windsurf everyone builds

510
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
software on windsurf for windsurf which

511
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is a unique way for us to actually get

512
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
feedback a lot of our feedback is

513
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
internal and if no one at the company

514
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,040
likes a part of the product it's

515
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,000
unlikely that a lot of people outside of

516
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,000
the company are going to like the

517
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,440
No, I I always try to run the company as

518
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
like the smallest company it can be. But

519
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,399
I think the goal of a company is not to

520
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,320
be a small company. I think the goal of

521
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,160
a company is to actually provide the

522
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,079
most value in a space. If the right way

523
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,199
to do that is be a bigger company. I

524
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,880
think that's like the right thing you

525
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,079
should sort of do. One of the operating

526
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
principles we sort of have at the

527
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
company is we try to run the company

528
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,120
fairly lean. And that doesn't mean we

529
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,519
have very few people. It just means that

530
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,959
for a given amount of ambition, we are

531
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,399
the smallest company we could possibly

532
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,160
be. And that means that people are

533
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,560
largely speaking underwater most of the

534
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,399
time. Hopefully like we don't have large

535
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,000
amounts of people that have too little

536
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
to do, right? The goal is everyone

537
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,199
should have too much to do. And because

538
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
of that, that forces rapid

539
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,360
prioritization inside the company with a

540
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,040
lot of urgency that triggers whether or

541
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
not we should hire people. And honestly,

542
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,399
that itself is a good forcing function

543
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
of how you should scale a company. You

544
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,959
scale a company when everyone is

545
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
underwater and the moment people are no

546
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,800
longer underwater, we don't scale the

547
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
company anymore. I think in in terms of

548
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,839
just some of the challenges obviously

549
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
like as the company gets bigger,

550
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,360
communication gets harder. So there are

551
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
some processes in place in terms of you

552
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,040
want to ship a feature, it's no longer

553
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
just one person did everything end to

554
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,279
end. There are like many different

555
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,880
parties involved. Uh but I think we

556
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,720
added more process in place to make sure

557
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,400
that even that could happen much faster.

558
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
If you run the company in a way where

559
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,760
everyone has their own set of

560
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,120
priorities, I think it's it's cool.

561
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,799
Everyone's kind of having a good time.

562
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,480
But I think, you know, this boils down

563
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,720
to why do companies work? I think they

564
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
work if you do one or two things really

565
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
well. Maybe even one. Forget about two,

566
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
maybe even one. The problem is then

567
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,280
actually if you were to imagine in a lot

568
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
of cases, it's very hard to just have

569
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,799
infinitely many people doing one thing

570
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,559
really well. So that naturally reduces

571
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,640
the number of people that you have at

572
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,320
the company. Yeah. I guess I guess the

573
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,760
the issue is naturally when you have

574
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
more people, they're going to be more

575
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,200
priorities, right? Like people are not

576
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,640
malicious, but they want to have

577
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
something to do. If there are enough

578
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
people to do what the original intent of

579
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,600
the company was, they're going to find

580
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,120
other things to do and that's going to

581
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,720
cause problems internally as well. One

582
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
of the things that I've sort of done is

583
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
I still interview everyone that joins

584
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,520
the company, make sure that they go

585
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,440
through a culture fit. I think that's

586
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,200
actually like quite important to me to

587
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,240
make sure that we are adding people that

588
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,240
are going to like maintain and preserve

589
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,080
and maybe even even just embrace the

590
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,760
culture we have inside the company. So I

591
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,600
think that's like honestly honestly like

592
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,960
a very key thing that I've not given up

593
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
even as the company has scaled you know

594
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,640
close to 200 people. I I think actually

595
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
it's the same principles that made the

596
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
company work when it's small. I I think

597
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,960
big companies are not that different

598
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
than small companies. Maybe it's hard to

599
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,600
operate like a small company when you're

600
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,880
a big company but I think if you were to

601
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,320
ask every big company they want to

602
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,840
operate like a startup. I think the very

603
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
hard thing is once again intellectual

604
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,840
honesty. It's very hard as the company

605
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
gets bigger for for a large group of

606
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,039
people to analyze what they're doing and

607
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,559
to say, "Hey, we should stop working on

608
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,799
this or should work on something else."

609
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,400
It gets very hard because people feel

610
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,240
some sort of safety as the company gets

611
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
bigger. But the reality is like no

612
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
company is really safe regardless of the

613
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,559
size. And that's how every company

614
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
should be operating. They should be

615
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,000
operating as if almost existential

616
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,679
dread. Not in that it's causing

617
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
paralysis, but in that it causes the

618
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,200
agency to kind of figure out what the

619
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,760
next thing to do is. Yeah. I think

620
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,320
people get they feel safety,

621
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
psychological safety by feeling that

622
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,120
what they're working on is the most

623
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,720
important thing, right? I think, you

624
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
know, people it's very hard to keep in

625
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,600
your head, hey, like let me go work hard

626
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,960
on something, but all the while it may

627
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,320
not be that useful for the company. And

628
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,799
I think as a company gets bigger, it's

629
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,240
very hard to have people that just still

630
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,520
don't have the psychological safety.

631
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,440
Maybe one interesting thing about the

632
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,120
company is I think companies have like

633
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
two sides attached to them, which is

634
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,559
that you need some form of irrational

635
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,559
optimism. The reason why you need

636
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,480
irrational optimism is without some

637
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,080
amount of optimism, there's no reason a

638
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,520
startup ever wins at anything. A big

639
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,520
company has more capital, more

640
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
resources, more distribution. So you

641
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,960
need to believe you can do something

642
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,480
better, right? With great people, uh you

643
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
can somehow build something that's

644
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,320
generational. You have to believe that.

645
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Uh which is in most cases not true,

646
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
right? So you somehow need to believe

647
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
that. But also at the same time,

648
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,200
sometimes that's just not going to be

649
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,799
the case. And you need to be very

650
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
realistic. And I think this comes with,

651
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,559
you know, uncompromising realism. Like

652
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,799
you need a healthy amount of both. You

653
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,400
need you need the optimism to go out and

654
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,760
do something when everyone else believes

655
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,120
it's not that valuable because if

656
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,400
everyone else believed it was valuable,

657
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,080
the big company would do it and you

658
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,160
would still lose. But all the while you

659
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,840
also need to agree most ideas are bad

660
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,440
ideas and you need to kill your ideas

661
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,880
fairly quickly as well. This is this is

662
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,240
like this tension that a company is

663
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,600
always going through. It progressively

664
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,960
gets harder and harder. The company gets

665
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,400
bigger. Uh but I think it's a strength

666
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,799
if a company can do that regardless of

667
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
what size it is.

668
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,640
Yeah. I think the only thing is that I

669
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,240
would sort of like to say is build for

670
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
where you think the technology is going,

671
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
not for today, right? And don't build

672
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,160
probably technologies in places that

673
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,000
like are as good as they will be given

674
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,200
where the technology is today. It feels

675
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,559
like it's going to be very hard to

676
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,159
differentiate in the long term. And

677
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
that's a hard thing to do, right? Uh

678
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
that means you you you actually need to

679
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,640
be willing to work on something that

680
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,320
doesn't feel like it's working for

681
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
maybe, you know, an indeterminate period

682
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,280
of time. I think what this means is

683
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,360
these kind of short-term heristics that

684
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,600
you invest deeply in that make a model

685
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
today work are probably actually have

686
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,559
massive diminishing returns because the

687
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
next model is going to be much better

688
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
and the heristics are going to be

689
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,159
unnecessary. I think the things that are

690
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,679
important are how do you actually take

691
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,960
advantage of the fact that you do have a

692
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,480
lot of users and build better

693
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
experiences for them and actually

694
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,039
because they are using your product

695
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,799
you're able to build better and better

696
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,039
experiences for them and these

697
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,320
experiences are better and learned in a

698
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,000
way they're actually learned from the

699
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,760
way people use the product and I think

700
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
you should be focusing on that not on

701
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,159
kind of cosmetic things that make a

702
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,159
model kind of magically do something

703
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,720
that probably is going to happen anyways

704
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,720
in 6 months.
