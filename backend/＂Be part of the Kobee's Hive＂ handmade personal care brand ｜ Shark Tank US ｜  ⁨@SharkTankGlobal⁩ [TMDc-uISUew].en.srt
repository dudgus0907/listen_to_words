00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello Sharks. My name is Kobe Harris.

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,319
I'm here today seeking 300,000 for 6%

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
equity. My company, Kobe's Co., we

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,719
believe Mother Nature herself deserves

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,200
the best kiss. Sharks, let's talk about

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,880
lips. We all have them. We all use them.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
But are we treating them right? That's

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,520
why I created Kobe's Co. 100% natural,

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,960
handmade, and sustainable lip balms that

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,199
don't just lock in moisture, they lock

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
in trust and transparency. Because our

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
ingredients are so clean that you could

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
eat them, but don't. We source our

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,400
beeswax from happy bees who listen to

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,000
classical music all day. And our oils

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,079
are pressed from plants who have won

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,040
beauty contest. Can you believe that

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
sharks? Nah, I'm just kidding. Kobish is

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,120
made from only four simple ingredients.

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,120
Beeswax, coconut oil, sunflower seed

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,559
oil, and mango butter. I started with

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,039
lip balms, but have quickly expanded to

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,600
a lotion bar, lip scrub, cuticle butter,

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,440
and even a hand sal. So, who's ready to

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,480
pucker up? Kiss the bad ingredients and

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,840
plastic packaging by with Kobe's Co.

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,600
Sharks. In front of you is an assortment

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,879
of Kobe's Coast products so you too can

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,760
be a part of the Kobe's hive. Wow. I

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,159
love the packaging. So each lip balm is

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,479
a tiny little thing. Mhm. Correct.

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
Smells very flavor. Yeah. We have We

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,760
have 10 different flavors. I did start

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,799
off with like a traditional size lip up

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
tube, but since I wanted to be

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,000
compostable, you have to be able to push

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,200
it up cuz there's no twist function. Um,

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
so it has to be a little bit shorter. It

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,080
has to be a little bit wider. So you put

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,000
your finger up there and Kobe, are you

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,520
selling in retail with this? No, it's

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,119
really all online right now. Direct to

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,200
consumer website and then Amazon as

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
well. Tell us about you. I started this

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
when I was a freshman in college.

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
Actually, I was doing research on

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,799
packaging and bees with one of my

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
sustainability professors. Went to my

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,560
mom. I was like, "Hey, mom. I got this

50
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
idea. It's called Kobes. I want to make

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
all natural lip balm personal care

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
products. I need a little bit of money

53
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,640
to, you know, just get the the base

54
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,400
ingredients." So, she gave me 200 bucks.

55
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,759
Went on to Amazon, bought, you know, all

56
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,280
the raw ingredients that I could find,

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,880
you know, the beeswax, the butters, the

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,799
oils. It really just spent that whole

59
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,479
summer formulating. Um it was like three

60
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,159
months and then I worked as a lifeguard.

61
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
So I would ended up towards the end of

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
the summer passing it out to you know

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
everybody that I could find. I would go

64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,159
home from my shift, make 50 bombs and a

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,680
little uh hot plate in my bedroom floor,

66
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,280
you know, mixing up waxes with a pipet,

67
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
filling them one by one, and then I

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
would walk around to the pool and then

69
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,840
hand them out to people at the pool. So

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
that first summer is really where I kind

71
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
of started to figure some things out. So

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
I had a day where I made $3,000 in

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,920
sales. That was the most money I've ever

74
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,360
seen in my entire life in my bank

75
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,280
account. I remember it hit. I was like,

76
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
I was so excited. I was ecstatic. Such a

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
good feeling. Yeah. And then I think a

78
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
month later, I had a day where I made

79
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
10,000 in one day. And then towards the

80
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
end of the summer, like two weeks

81
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
before, classes went back up. Did the 15

82
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,879
grand in sales one day and went on my

83
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
campus portal, exited out of all of my

84
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,360
classes. And since classes were online,

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,800
I just told my dad, you know, I'm still

86
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
in school. But really, I was just in the

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
basement making lip balms and trying to

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,840
market all day.

89
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
So Kobe, your story is so amazing and it

90
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
really touched me. I did the same thing

91
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,000
and I I dropped out of college. I ended

92
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
up starting my business. So, I hear that

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
I My dad today obviously looks at me and

94
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
he's like, "Honey, you made the right

95
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
decision." I bet your parents are so

96
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,159
proud of you. Yeah. My mom was a a huge

97
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
proponent of kind of help. She started a

98
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
couple businesses when she got out of

99
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,159
school as well cuz I was going to school

100
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
to be a doctor actually at first. That's

101
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,040
what I wanted to do. I went to summer

102
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
camps for it. I took summer classes,

103
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,000
shadowed surgeons. When I went to my mom

104
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,280
that summer and I was like, "Hey mom, I

105
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
think I might want to switch from trying

106
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
to become a doctor to make lip balm."

107
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
And as crazy as it sounded, she was

108
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
like, you know, Kobe, you know, I

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
understand. You know, go with your gut.

110
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
And that's kind of what's propelled me

111
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
forward to have the confidence to be

112
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,879
able to do some of the things that I'm

113
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,599
doing. That year we did about 30 grand.

114
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,200
The year after that we did about 200.

115
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,959
And then last year we did 864,000.

116
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,360
Um, and this year we've already done a

117
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
little over 1.5 million to date. Wow.

118
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
Wow. 1.5.

119
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
Like wow.

120
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,879
That trajectory is quite quite large.

121
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,560
But what was it that made that change?

122
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,879
Um, I just learned how to run Facebook

123
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
ads, like Tik Tok, posting videos. Um,

124
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,440
that's really what I know how to do.

125
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
I'm, you know, Gen Z. I'm a young kid. I

126
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,519
know social media. Do you know your

127
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,720
rorowass, your return on ad spend? It's

128
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,599
about 2.5 to three. Um, okay. That's a

129
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,360
little light, but my question is for an

130
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,799
investor, I look at this and say, if you

131
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
know your rorowaz and you know your CAC,

132
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,200
your customer acquisition and I give you

133
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,680
300,000, why wouldn't you just use that

134
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,079
to pour it on the fire? In other words,

135
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
you don't need anything else other than

136
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,359
more capital to spend more on

137
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
advertising. Sure. What does it cost you

138
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,600
to acquire a customer? Um, right now

139
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,320
blended it's 14 15 bucks. What do you

140
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,560
make on your average order? Uh, $32. Our

141
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
main skew was like a six-pack or a 6 to

142
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
9 pack. Yes, they're it's a lip balms.

143
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
The rest of this stuff is a fraction of

144
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
the sales. Yes. So lip balm was about

145
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
75% of our sales. The rest of it is

146
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,919
personal care. It's about 25%. This

147
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,400
little unit right here cost $5. I mean,

148
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,160
you sell it for five sell it for $5 cost

149
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
26 cents to make. What are you going to

150
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
make this year? So, I think we'll finish

151
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
the year with around three and a half $4

152
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
million. What are you going to make on

153
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
that after you pay yourself and all your

154
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,160
employees? I think we'll net about 7

155
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,880
to800,000. So, Kobe, first of all, as a

156
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,400
mom of sons, I have a son about your

157
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,280
age. Um, blown away by your story. Like,

158
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,759
I'm so proud of you. This is not my this

159
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
isn't my wheelhouse. I want to buy your

160
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
products. I'm going to use your

161
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
products. I'm going to tell everybody

162
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
about it, but it's just not the right

163
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,199
investment for me. So, I'm out. I

164
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,199
appreciate it. Kobe, what do you need? I

165
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
need somebody who can give me a little

166
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,160
bit of guidance. Um, we need a little

167
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
bit of help maybe with distribution. You

168
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
know, lip balm is a $5 skew, so it's

169
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
really hard to sell a lot online if

170
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
we're not selling a huge volume. Um, so

171
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
I think being in those those checkout

172
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
counters, the the point of purchase,

173
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
retail would be very very helpful. I

174
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
could get you retail in pretty well

175
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
every big box. And they do sell millions

176
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,560
of dollars a week in lip balm. So that

177
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,800
but to get the shelf space at point of

178
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
sale, that ain't easy because you're

179
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
displacing somebody and they're going to

180
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
want a listing fee for that. I like the

181
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,320
deal. I'll make you an offer. I'll give

182
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
you the 300,000 for 20%. 20%. Yeah.

183
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,800
Okay. I don't think you're worth 5

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,680
million bucks. So K, I'll tell you what

185
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,319
I think. Sure. I feel that it's a hard

186
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,880
road once you try to go into retail

187
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
because how do you stand out amongst the

188
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,120
rest because there's so many out there

189
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,160
right now and some with the bees kind of

190
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,120
name. Um I really feel it's a great

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,479
online business for you. I love it and

192
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
you've done a great job but not really

193
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,039
right investment for me. I'm sorry. I'm

194
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,520
out. I appreciate it. So I think you're

195
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,199
going to crush it. I just don't see the

196
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,440
lip balm business as something that I

197
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,840
can really bring the value ad that you

198
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,720
really need. And so for that reason, I'm

199
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,240
out. Thank you, man. I love this. And it

200
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
reminds me of my story. You know, my

201
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
mother's the same way. She wanted to

202
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
start her own businesses, but uh you

203
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,199
know, life happened. She became a single

204
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,960
mother and uh she had to uh work a bunch

205
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
of jobs to make sure that I was okay.

206
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Sure. So, she wasn't able to fulfill

207
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,360
that dream. So, so uh we kind of got

208
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,880
together and mom helped me. So, I really

209
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,080
love this. I love the idea. Um, I I just

210
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,680
don't think I want to be in this

211
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,520
business. I want to be in the Kobe

212
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
business, though. But this is not the

213
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,919
business I want to be in. So, I wish you

214
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,319
all the best. It's not for me. I'm out.

215
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,599
Thank you. Well, then there was All

216
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,120
roads lead back to the big be in here.

217
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,400
I would never go into the lip balm

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,400
business because it's so competitive.

219
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
The only deal I'm looking at is giving

220
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,840
you $300,000 cuz I really think you're

221
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
sharp. I really do. I want to show this

222
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,560
to my retail distribution partners, but

223
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,039
I don't want you to fall in love with

224
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
that too fast. Sure. Because I I really

225
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,800
want to focus if we're going to do this

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
deal on this rorowaz thing because

227
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,639
you've proven you've got enough gasoline

228
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,039
going here that we can make the flame

229
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
bigger, but I want 20%. A lot of work,

230
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,759
you know, I want to get my money back

231
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,919
one day. So 300,000 for 20% is 1.5

232
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,919
million. We'll end the year doing almost

233
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,080
having netting 7800,000. So you're only

234
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
val two times that. And you're saying

235
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
the only thing that I'm going to be

236
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,319
really using the money for is pouring it

237
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
on marketing. So why can I not go get a

238
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
loan for 300,000, spend it on marketing,

239
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,479
and then absolutely, you know, I'll be

240
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,240
I'll be right there and keeping all 20%.

241
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,520
What I will say is I know lip balm is

242
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,879
not the traditional business, but like

243
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,120
you said, if you guys like Kobe, want to

244
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,479
bet on Kobe, you know, this is one of

245
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
those things I would love to for you

246
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,319
guys to be a part of. I would add one

247
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
thing though, you could do that or you

248
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,680
could do it the way I do it and there'd

249
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
be a big difference in yield because you

250
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,319
don't have the advantage of scale. What

251
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,160
we do is consolidate our buys across all

252
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
of our companies and buy at a fraction

253
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
of what you're paying because you're

254
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
just Kobe. Not that you're a bad guy,

255
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,199
it's just you don't have the buying

256
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,959
power. Just between you and I, that's my

257
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
deal. You don't have to take it, Kobe.

258
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:41,479
Make a decision. I understand. So, you

259
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,479
wouldn't do even 300,000 at 10%. No. No.

260
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,880
Uh, I'm not going to give up 20% of my

261
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,200
company today. What would you give up?

262
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,920
Um, I'd be willing to take more money.

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,360
um for I think 300's enough for what

264
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,440
you're doing. It's a big ask actually

265
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
for what you've got. But if I stay at

266
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,640
300, you won't meet in the middle

267
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,640
between 10 and 20. That's 15.

268
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,200
Tough decision. I know.

269
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,279
15% off. It should be painful, Kobe.

270
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,880
Those are great deals. Cuz I'm I'm

271
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,519
suffering like an animal right now about

272
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,600
the 5% I just gave up. He doesn't want

273
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:23,640
to suffer like an animal, too. Yeah. No,

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,640
me neither. Um, pain both sides. Pain.

275
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,920
I won't do that.

276
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,320
I appreciate it. Thank you, Kobe.

277
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,200
Congratulations, guys.

278
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,200
So impressed by you.
