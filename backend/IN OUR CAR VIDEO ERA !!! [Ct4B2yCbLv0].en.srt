44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,600

46
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,799
for Chris in his room and he's like oh

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,040
give me a minute I I can't find my belt

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,880
my first question was how many different

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
places are you taking your pants off

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,600
yeah not many your belt should be EAS to

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,520
find but Chris hasn't been able to find

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,880
his belt but he sleeps in my room

53
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,240
essentially every single night it's not

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,200
in your room and I said Chris just go

55
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,159
check in my room I would never wear

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,840
jeans up to sleep though you know what I

57
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,000
mean you take them off and go to bed

58
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,840
correct but if I'm going up to bed for

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
but I would never I would never even

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,640
walk to where I sleep to get with a with

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,200
jeans and a belt on I would never even

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,360
do that anyways Chris can't find his

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,480
belt and now he thinks that one of me or

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,080
Matt are going to miraculously surprise

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,319
him with it when it's never going to

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
happen his belt is gone till he finds it

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,519
I have no idea where it is where did you

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,080
take your pants off last my bedroom at

69
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,160
so where the [ __ ] is the belt like where

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,920

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,760

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,040
in my room and it's not inside of a pair

78
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,680
of pants cuz that happens a lot I think

79
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,480
I this is a skill issue well look what I

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,360
brought is my drink of choice tonight we

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,599
love it I felt the bubbles like in my

82
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,599
throat oh I hate the conversations that

83
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,239
you have with people when you're

84
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,840
like you know that there it's like um

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
there's nothing else you're not going to

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,840
ever do anything else but this

87
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,599
conversation you know what I mean yeah I

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,519
don't live life like that I'm an

89
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,640
opportunist I never see not I never see

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,360
the conversation I'm in as the possible

91
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,720
last one at this point no neither do I

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
but like I hate like the initial

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,680

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,280

second time or like the like like the

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,479
straight to a vending machine and ball

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,479
out give me all the soda I wonder how

183
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,919
much a case of 12 was if soda is five

184
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,080
wait that's actually crazy that I just

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,319
thought about no no it's not yeah it is

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
like a a soda can from a vending machine

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,000
is a dollar but a 12pack from the

188
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,720
grocery store is like six or like five

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,319
where are you going what grocery stores

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,479

191
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,960
how much is a case of soda what are you

192
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,039
what are you using a

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
walkie-talkie how much is a case of soda

194
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,080
over like sounds like some's going to

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,160
reply through there

196
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,759
$10 I don't like that at all it's not

197
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,560
even a deal anymore like I remember when

198
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,319
I it was never a deal deal inflation yes

199
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,520
but like if I were to own a vending

200
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,879
machine now I'd have to buy so much bulk

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,280
soda to profit from my thing if I'm

202
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,039
selling them for a dollar which I feel

203
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,000
like is classic like every soda used to

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,960
be a dollar I miss so I can go to a

205
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,080
convenience store and get a drink for $1

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,639
bill now it's like I got to dig for like

207
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,240
50 cents never have it that's another

208
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,800
thing if something is a $1.75 just

209
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,400
charge me $2 I don't want the quarter I

210
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,879
just can't believe I just can't believe

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
we've gotten to a point where there

212
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,800
where like there's like cashless places

213
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,879
like I go to pay cash and people are

214
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,639
like oh we don't accept this I'm like

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,120
you don't expect you don't accept money

216
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,840
yeah yeah that's a little insane it's

217
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,759
like where the [ __ ] am I am I in Mars

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,000
and I don't know how the [ __ ] I got here

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,520
you don't accept like cash

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,919
dollars I'm like everyone that's the

221
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,479
most ridiculous thing to me when you go

222
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,120
to pick cash oh we're like a we're do

223
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,560
cashless service now I'm like

224
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,560
what you don't human you don't expect

225
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,120
USD currency craziest the craziest thing

226
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,720
is the craziest thing is you can afford

227
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,519
it you have the you have that is money

228
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,039
that's valuable you would walk out of

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,880
there empty-handed it's just crazy to me

230
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,320
that a debit card has become more

231
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,360
valuable than if I had a $100 bill the

232
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,039
bank and I went somewhere I love when

233
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,720
like a place is like oh we don't accept

234
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,600
50s or hundreds it's like oh there all I

235
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,080
have and they're like yeah we don't

236
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,440
accept hundreds it's like okay thanks

237
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,279
for the free

238
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,959
groceries the fact that you don't have

239
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,360
enough money to give me like a skill

240
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,560
issue sounds like that's your fault tell

241
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,160

Dunkin Donuts I'm like what no the

248
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,600

when you order munkin and you can't what

250
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,640

254
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,920
an individual person and all you have to

255
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,800
do is scan a fingerprint I am jumping

your tab of life that's going to be real

263
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,959
what I think of with cashless [ __ ] is

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,800
how how do like homeless people who are

265
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,720

266
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,480
side of the street they get cash going

267
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
how do how do they if a homeless person

268
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
ask you oh can I have five bucks so I

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
can go get like a sandwich and you give

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,600
the homeless person $5 to go get a

271
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,760
sandwich and they go to a cashless place

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,640

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,040
long so am I when I go and take a [ __ ]

309
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,880

310
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,720
taking a [ __ ] [ __ ] the whole you know

311
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:37,480
what I mean so so so what when do we

312
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,920
classify something in activity than than

313
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,040
than an era I completely we need like a

314
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,120
timeline of I know it is an era an era

315
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,279
has to be longer than a year and like a

316
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,399
half to me a

317
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:56,600
decade I'm talking like you are not no a

318
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,959
insane I'm talking like I'm like Matt

319
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,519
can we go I'm in my wife give me a

320
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,399
second

321
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,399
you take [ __ ] to another level I would

322
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,920
never use it no matter what but I'm

323
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,360
saying if you do say era whatever I

324
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,519
think like freshman year sure that's one

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,440
sophomore that's another like that can

326
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,320
be it's all thing like that can be a

327
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,480
thing I don't even believe that I think

328
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
I I think you can cover it all with the

329
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,440
word High

330
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,720
School the era [ __ ] is corny it's like

331
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,560
what are you like counting like like

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,120
like er era to me is like an era era of

333
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,880
like the Egyptians building pyramids or

334
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,639
like the era

335
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,199
of US Presidency like I don't think of

336
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,800
like the word era is in my brain wait

337
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,360
hold on reset this Chris an era is a

338
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,680
period of time that lasts several

339
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,800
hundred million years correct correct

340
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,320
it's the largest division of time and is

341
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,120
made up of two or more periods for

342
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,720
example the I don't even the mesos zoic

343
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,680
era lasted 252 million

344
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,079
years if we in the US go in like a

345
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,199
drought for hundreds of years we going

346
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,240
to be like oh the US is in its drought

347
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:18,120
era but no need like an era of like the

348
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,079
era of which the US went without water

349
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,199
like we I just need to say like when I

350
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,560
saw that I got a little I got a like a

351
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,160
headache and a little sick and I was

352
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,120
like you are not in a graduation I feel

353
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,800
like that era is just it's just it's

354
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,480
that's something that I do like that I

355
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,639
say that I instantly regret is like

356
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,240
whenever I'm like oh that was like an

357
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,480
era of time like I instantly like I will

358
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,480
use that and then I regret doing it but

359
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,160
also like when I think of like us

360
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,320
touring we've gone on tours and we've

361
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
been on tour buses for a month long I

362
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,920
would never look back and be like oh the

363
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,480
versus tour era because that's still

364
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,839
were that's still not enough time for me

365
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,000
in my brain to consider that an era like

366
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:02,519
I think of era as like Mesopotamia and

367
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
what ancient Mayans and like lit like

368
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,120
the a like that's what I think of when I

369
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,360
the word erae I agree I'm think like

370
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,959
what was the era how long do it take for

371
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,880
them to build pyramids in ancient Egypt

372
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,600
that's where my brain goes or when like

373
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,880
the people are telling their kids like

374
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,360

375
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,000
their like daughter or son that they're
