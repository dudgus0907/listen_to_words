00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,800
but whatever doesn't work

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
my biggest fear when it comes to dead

116
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,500
animals is one of them like jumping up

117
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,300

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,419

120
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:39,000

121
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,340
oh my God because when I was little

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,560
this is where my fear rooted from

123
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,199
genuinely Miracles ran apart is that

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,060

125
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,979

clue what the [ __ ] it is an OtterBox

304
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,600

305
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,740
like dads have like on their Clips oh

oh wait their new stuff's not bad

308
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,660
they're just all simple like tough are

309
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,660
we talking like generic OtterBox

310
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,820

311
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:26,579
said OtterBox a sword sword smash no

312
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,300
absolutely that would hurt

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:32,700
well I wasn't it's all metaphorical okay

314
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,040

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,620
talk about how kind you are why

316
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
why

317
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,880
are we looking over my shoulder I think

318
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,279
like if Nick was a chocolate he'd be

319
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,360
like a Kit Kat like the big cat like the

320
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,160
three the row of three of them boom boom

321
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,139
boom yeah like I feel like that'd be us

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,240
three not even just Nick like the big

323
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,899
cat where it's like you know a normal

324
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,420
kit kat is for us this way hey big cat

325
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,040
is three that way that'd be us yeah

326
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,899
that's hard

327
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,920
and then if Nick wasn't there and he

328
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,360
doesn't want to be a part of like the

329
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,940
whole chocolate reference we'll just be

330
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,040
Reese's like a pack okay smash or

331
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,740
passing piano

332
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,260
yes I hate pianos I can't believe kids

333
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,180
actually took piano lessons oh don't be

334
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:22,579
mean

335
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:26,180
a little someone's gonna ask for aspirin

336
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,180
that's totally fine

337
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,700
did I say my contacts please go ahead

338
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,579
there was this kid that I was friends

339
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,639
with

340
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:41,399
no listen he didn't enjoy playing the

341
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,519
piano he hated it but his mom had him

342
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,380
signed up for piano classes and me and

343
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,420
him wanted to always hang out like after

344
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,420
like school after the third fourth grade

345
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,920
but he couldn't because I can't yeah I

346
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,839
think parents have forced their kids to

347
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,940
do like extracurricular activities like

348
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,139
Chuck if you're a parent force you to do

349
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,820
something like that like an activity

350
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,620
that like really that you don't want to

351
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,639
do I say punch him in the face okay

352
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:08,699
don't don't do all that dude like the

353
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,380
kid's mom would always make him go home

354
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,120
and play the piano when he wanted to

355
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,160
like hang out if you can play the piano

356
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,779
you could probably play numerous other

357
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,579
instruments yeah because it's the same

358
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,920

366
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,660

367
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,360
audience one day

368
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,880

369
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,260
I know I know it's just sometimes in the

370
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,060
middle of a car video we'll randomly

371
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,579

372
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,620

373
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:55,320

380
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,860
exact thing happened last time we were

381
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,240
that's so true the posture too there's

382
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,199
got to be a portal somewhere bro

383
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,199
literally this dude

384
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,220

385
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,079

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,100
exact same parking lot some dude from a

388
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,260
[ __ ] there's got to be something

389
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,920
that's like a trail that way

390
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,019
who's walking on a train

391
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,760
in the [ __ ] morning either serial

392
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,399
killers or those who want to be a victim

393
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,899
of a serial killing there's the only two

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,820
people walking on I don't think anyone

395
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,800
ever really wants to be so stay off the

396
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,259
[ __ ] Trails okay that's my whole

397
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,959
point of the goddamn sentence dude next

398
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,399
word doesn't like I don't like what

399
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,259
grout

400
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,980
that's not a word

401
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:59,579
incorrect what the [ __ ] does a word It's

402
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,040
gotta be grout is when you're like a a

403
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:04,140
lining tile or like brick or like

404
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,220
something that's like in many pieces

405
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,919
grout is like the inside of it that just

406
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,140
[ __ ] up the camera for sure when you

407
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,620
somebody's just out there whistling like

408
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,620
I just hear

409
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,459
and it's really scaring me are you dead

410
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,319

411
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,720
so excited that's so scared like I I

412
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,179
think there's just somebody right over

413
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,000
there whistling what I'm adding that's

414
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:33,240
my list of biggest fear you have an

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,799
active list of that oh yeah no way can

416
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,179
you read a couple

417
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,700
no dude not yet like what is this plan a

418
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,140
fresheners how do we feel love it I hate

419
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,960
air fresheners I feel like they don't

420
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,140
keep the air fresh yeah it's like a

421
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,640
momentarily smell yeah actually perfume

422
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,620
works better as an air freshener than

423
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
air fresheners I agree like when someone

424
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,340
sprays a perfume that [ __ ] stays

425
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,500
forever forever dude if like if you have

426
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,980
a cologne or perfume in a car with you

427
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,419
or something it's Never Gonna Leave

428
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,400
that's why I love when I when we go back

429
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,020
from LA and to Boston and back and forth

430
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,299
because whenever I walk back into my

431
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:14,000
bedroom did I tell you my plan

432
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,000
like dude what you've interrupted me

433
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,740
no but my plan but I love walking into

434
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,059
my room and smelling it I get that on my

435
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,240
plan yeah yes

436
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:27,240
I want so badly to have like a body wash

437
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,460
a conditioner I've heard this telling

438
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,020
you again

439
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,700
I want like a bunch of different like a

440
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:38,520
soap a body wash uh all at all products

441
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,440
I want like candles everything yeah in

442
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,539
like a specific scent and then every

443
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,740
like

444
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:50,039
3.5 months I want to change them out

445
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:53,400
no 3.4 isn't divisible Seasons Seasons

446
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,559
yeah oh my God hurry up Nick wants to

447
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,240
have every single season I want to like

448
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,460
switch them all out so that way when

449
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,900
like a full year goes by and I'm back to

450
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,400
that scent it will remind me of

451
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,679
nostalgia I'd be like oh my God remember

452
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,620
that one time

453
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,260
so you basically want to create all your

454
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,480
scents for one season for all four

455
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,340
seasons so that you can like Circle back

456
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
to all of them with memories yeah

457
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,280
because then like the first day I used

458
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,380
those scent from a year ago to bring me

459
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,780
Vibes like oh what was I doing a year

460
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,039
ago I think there should be a car video

461
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,679
where we each really try on a poem okay

462
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm down like really hardcore yes like

463
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,880
wait can we do a fan submitted talent

464
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,039
show where they do their talents and

465
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,500
send in videos oh I have a gorilla

466
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,240
really good

467
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,840
really good idea whatever a fan submits

468
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,340
us them doing we have to recreate

469
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,380
because I know some of these little

470
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,120
girls can do some crazy [ __ ] like like

471
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,580
say that one of the girls fills up her

472
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,840
tub with like ketchup and jumps in I

473
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,520
don't even have to do I'm not doing that

474
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,380
no like I think it's a challenge because

475
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,600
that's also that just invokes them to do

476
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,520
like violent things like we're not gonna

477
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,840
recreate it okay I think we could have a

478
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,400
talent show though where they already

479
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,500
know what they're doing a little bit we

480
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,240
should play the extreme game and we each

481
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,480
take turns doing something until we're

482
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,900
at like extreme levels and then no like

483
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,900
I'm good

484
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
[ __ ]

485
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,440
[ __ ] like drink more water I don't

486
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,919
need something like that you want to

487
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,380
feel extreme no at all no I'm extremely

488
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,480
[ __ ] okay with not doing that I like

489
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,160
a good tall glass of water and uh my

490
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,240
feet up and a bag of goddamn chips

491
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,240
