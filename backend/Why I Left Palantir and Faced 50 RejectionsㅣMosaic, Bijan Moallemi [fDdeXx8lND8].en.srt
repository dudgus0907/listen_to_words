1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,399
if I'm playing a match and I lose a

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,120
point I can't worry about the point that

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,520
I lost cuz if I'm still thinking about

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,919
the point that I lost I'm going to lose

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,840
the next point in the next game and I'm

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,559
going to lose the match the same is true

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,599
in a startup we had like seven or eight

8
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,719
people in so I'm in my master bedroom

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,279
closet getting a call from an investor

10
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,519
hoping for a yes and we got a no that

11
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,119
was super painful we weren't ready for

12
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,320
that but it motivated us to be better

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,080
move faster and things moved on and so

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,119
later that year we were raising a series

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,800
a and that same investor came back

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,239
around actually saying hey I've heard

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,760
about the progress I'm seeing everything

18
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,760
you guys are doing I'd love to be a part

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,360
of the round I don't see no as a failure

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,559
if I'm doing the same thing over and

21
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,239
over and not learning that's failure but

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
if there's mistakes along the way and

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,039
I'm learning from that I actually see

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,760
that as a positive thing I don't

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,440
necessarily see that as a failure

26
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,120
ultimately that's that's just part of

27
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,440
the

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,879
journey I'm be Mami mosaic. Tech is a

29
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,840
strategic Finance platform we hook in to

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,519
data sources across the business and

31
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,600
automate a lot of the manual work that

32
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,840
Finance teams would be traditional doing

33
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,560
we debuted as number 97 on the deoe fast

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
500 and so that's for the fastest 500

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,200
growing tech companies for Revenue

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
perspectives pretty happy to be top 100

37
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,360
on that list and I think it's just a

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,840
testament to all the team's hard work

39
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,150
over the last few years to hit those

40
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:24,069
numbers

41
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:24,069
[Music]

42
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,480
[Music]

43
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,079
uh my dad moved to the United States

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,200
when he was 18 to escape the revolution

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,920
in Iran working three jobs to pay for

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,360
college was sending money back to his

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
family ended up getting two degrees in 3

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,159
years and so I think that work ethic

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
that tenacity was something that he had

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,680
something that my mom had and was just

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
kind of the way that I was raised for me

52
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,360
I think the first time that I really

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
started to see that in myself was on the

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,079
tennis court played competitive tennis

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,200
growing up for me was never the most

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,080
talented person never the most athletic

57
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,840
on the court but I felt like if I was

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
training harder than everyone that would

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,400
put me in a position to where I would

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
have a chance to win any match before

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,920
I'd get ready for tennis tournaments

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,400
they'd always have these National

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,560
tournaments over the summer and they

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,760
would be in the hottest places so San

65
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,640
Antonio in August which is 100Â° 100%

66
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,360
humidity or maybe it's Fort Lauderdale

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
Florida and the weather here doesn't

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,519
really get you prepared for that what

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,879
that would mean for me is going out to

70
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,959
Palm Springs training and sweatpants and

71
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,640
a hoodie in 100 degree weather for a

72
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,040
week getting ready for those tournaments

73
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,560
and that's definitely the attitude that

74
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,319
I've kind of taken with me throughout my

75
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,800
entire life I think that's the attitude

76
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,200
that you can't really lose CU you're

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,080
always getting better and in the long

78
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,280
run we feel like that'll help us

79
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,200
win paler is an amazing Company the

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,080
company was just over 100 people when I

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,879
joined the finance function wasn't

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,720
really built out yet and so we went on

83
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,560
this incredible journey for seven years

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,959
building and scaling the finance team

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,760
doing close to three billion of a

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,640
quarter dollars in Revenue by the time

87
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,920
we left when you've got a rocket ship

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
and you've got a company who doesn't

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,400
have their finances in order the

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
business was asking these reasonable

91
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
questions what's our cash balance how

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,159
much revenue do we have who owes us

93
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,440
money and early on because we didn't

94
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,120
have the infrastructure we couldn't

95
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,640
answer those questions ultimately we

96
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,440
were working really hard I remember I

97
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,200
was living in San Francisco at the time

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
we were taking the first Cal Train down

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
to paloalto in the morning taking the L

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,000
Cal train back up but because we were

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
doing our work kind of the oldfashioned

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,159
way which is using Excel to do

103
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,000
everything we were spending so much time

104
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,959
pulling data cleaning data mapping it

105
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,680
doing the analysis that if the business

106
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,080
asked us an important question it would

107
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,959
take us days or weeks to answer it and

108
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,840
with the pace of business these days if

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
it takes you two weeks to answer the

110
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,280
question people have moved on they need

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
something that is faster they need

112
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,560
something that's real time or proactive

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,840
paler was step one my co-founders and I

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,040
we each went on to be CFOs that other

115
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,959
high growth VCB companies if you don't

116
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,000
have the billion dollars on the balance

117
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,000
sheet like pal had at the time you don't

118
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,879
have a technical Finance team which most

119
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,519
teams don't you're actually in a big

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,480
disadvantage and the problem that we

121
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,319
were solving in paler it's Mission

122
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,040
critical every company needs to

123
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,439
understand their finances we realize

124
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,040
that hey everything we did at paler this

125
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,840
is actually something that's needed and

126
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,400
it's ubiquitous for all companies it's

127
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,000
not just a paler specific problem as we

128
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,800
were just getting the company built we

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
spent a really long time thinking about

130
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,840
the name we bought a dictionary and so

131
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,600
my co-founder and I we probably spend 2

132
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,720
three hours a day just paging through

133
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,240
the the dictionary we landed on Mosaic

134
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,039
the name itself if you think about a

135
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,120
mosaic tile one tile on its own could be

136
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,720
one system of data and that's valuable

137
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,840
but it's only so valuable but when you

138
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,560
zoom out and you've got a thousand tiles

139
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,160
representing all the data across the

140
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,199
business you can actually paint

141
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,039
beautiful Mosaic this beautiful Vision

142
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,759
about the company we're a small startup

143
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,720
we hasn't hadn't raised any money at the

144
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,080
time there's other mosaics out there

145
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,000
it's a somewhat common name and we

146
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,880
landed on Tech because we're a

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,919
technology company first and foremost

148
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
and Mosaic is really all about pulling

149
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,560
in data from various systems across the

150
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
business using that data to plan

151
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,680
forecast analyze do all the most

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,600
strategic important work that a finance

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,600
team is responsible

154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,720
for for myself and one of my co-founders

155
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,400
we're Finance people we're not the most

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
outgoing that isn't really the most

157
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,240
natural thing for us but it had to be

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
done and so back to us and the way that

159
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,080
we sold and the way that we were

160
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,960
probably presenting ourselves we got a

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
lot of nose and it's not always fun to

162
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,880
get no when people tell you no I'm not

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
interested or they don't really

164
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,440
understand what you're selling it

165
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,560
probably took a few months and 50 or 60

166
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,960
NOS for us to really start to figure

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,000
selling out the memorable no that we

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,360
have actually is more on the investing

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,360
side so I remember early on there were a

170
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,360
handful of investors that that we were

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,840
talking to and we felt like our pitch

172
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,800
was pretty good at the time we were

173
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,039
starting to get a little bit of traction

174
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,400
and we got kind of late stage in these

175
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,319
processes with these investors and we're

176
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,199
in I think the closet cuz the room

177
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,960
itself that was my office we had like

178
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,039
seven or eight people in so I'm in my

179
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,400
master bedroom closet getting a call

180
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,520
from an investor hoping for a yes and we

181
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,919
got a no that was super painful we

182
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,639
weren't ready for that but it motivated

183
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,120
us to be better move faster build the

184
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,120
product faster build the business

185
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,680
faster and things moved on and so later

186
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,639
that year we were raising a series a and

187
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,440
that same investor came back around

188
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,880
without us reaching out actually saying

189
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,319
hey I've heard about the progress I'm

190
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,319
seeing everything you guys are doing I'd

191
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,280
love to be a part of the real so I don't

192
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,639
see no as a failure if I'm doing the

193
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,800
same thing over and over and not

194
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,240
learning that's failure but if there's

195
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,639
mistakes along the way if there's

196
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
something that goes wrong and I'm

197
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,919
learning from that I actually see that

198
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
as a positive thing I don't necessarily

199
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,560
see that as a failure ultimately that's

200
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,400
that's just part of the

201
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,440
journey in a tennis match if I'm playing

202
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,120
a match and I lose a point I can't worry

203
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
about the point that I lost cuz if I'm

204
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,879
still thinking about the point that I

205
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,199
lost I'm going to lose the next point in

206
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,360
the next game and I'm going to lose the

207
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,080
match so you need to have this attitude

208
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,479
where you analyze that okay what can I

209
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,000
do better but then as you're starting

210
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,960
the next point you kind of it's water

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,800
under the bridge you move on the same is

212
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,039
true in a startup for everyone that's

213
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,319
involved in a startup but I think really

214
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,680
for Founders you feel it orders of

215
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,120
magnitude more the highs are high the

216
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
lows are low and there's days where you

217
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,240
don't want to get out of bed you don't

218
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
know what the next step is but I think

219
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,479
it's really all around persistence and

220
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
giving 110% and doing that day in day

221
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,039
out over a long period of time if you're

222
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,520
thinking about starting a company are

223
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,160
you ready to be persistent are you ready

224
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,800
to overcome those tough days are you

225
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
ready to do that for many years and if

226
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,800
you are being a Founder is the most

227
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,800
amazing thing but it's it's not for

228
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,560
everyone one of our core beliefs across

229
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,599
the business and we have three core

230
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,319
values but the first one is champion and

231
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,319
the customer the way to improve your

232
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,159
retention is really understand what your

233
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,759
customers want what they need and the

234
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,159
more time that you can spend with them

235
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,000
the better off you're going to be

236
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,960
listening to customers I think two

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,479
things are important number one you have

238
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,240
to make sure that you're listening to

239
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,080
the right customer and the the right

240
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,039
customer from last year may not be the

241
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,199
right customer for today or tomorrow so

242
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
that's something that you have to keep

243
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,879
in mind for us the customer that we were

244
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
serving early on was kind of the SMB the

245
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
small Market customer the things that we

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
were hearing from customers when we had

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,320
those customers was our everything that

248
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,120
they cared about in the SMB now the last

249
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
couple years the focus for us has been

250
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,959
pushing at markets really trying to wean

251
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,839
off of some of those smaller customers

252
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,479
and focus more on the mid-market and the

253
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,479
upper midm Market we do still have

254
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,560
customers that are in that SMB space

255
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,720
will sometimes sell to them but the

256
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,320
feedback that we hear from customers at

257
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,160
this point we're going to listen more to

258
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
the mid-market customer than we are to

259
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,600
the S&B customer and that's just because

260
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
of the business that we want to build

261
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,880
and and where we're trying to go and I

262
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,880
think second is it's really easy easy to

263
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,640
fall into the Trap when you have a large

264
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,320
customer to bend the road map and do

265
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,040
exactly what a big customer wants you to

266
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,880
do and you have to be making sure that

267
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,079
you're listening to the broader customer

268
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,079
base and not focusing on what one

269
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,760
individual customer might be saying I

270
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,320
think our approach I'm really proud of

271
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,399
this is we've spun up this team we call

272
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
it the rapid response team where it's a

273
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,360
handful of Engineers it's a smaller team

274
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
but it allows us to take the requests

275
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,880
that we're hearing from customers and if

276
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,160
there's smaller or medium type features

277
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,880
we'll try to weave those things into the

278
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,959
road map it's a nice way to get quick

279
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,000
wins for customers make them feel like

280
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,399
their voice is heard without actually

281
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,200
bending and changing the bigger road map

282
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,680
that most of the team's working on I

283
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,160
think customers value it but at the same

284
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,160
time it's all lowed us to stay very

285
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,880
focused I think focus is probably the

286
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,640
most important thing is a startup it's

287
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,120
less around what are you building it's

288
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,120
actually more around what are you not

289
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,720
building I think for us as we started

290
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,200
Mosaic we saw other folks across the

291
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,160
business at paler folks legal folks in

292
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,040
HR folks in sales folks in marketing all

293
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,600
other departments and they'd been

294
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,240
blessed with these amazing Technologies

295
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,920
these tools made them better at their

296
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,000
job it made their work faster easier and

297
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,160
on the finance side for the most part

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,040
over the last 40 years things haven't

299
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,200
changed you're still doing your work in

300
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,279
spreadsheets um in Google Sheets and

301
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Excel it's Rosen columns and the

302
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,399
technology hasn't really Advanced and so

303
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,040
we felt like there was an opportunity to

304
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
really push forward and bring this

305
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,760
technology to the finance Persona a

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,440
Persona that has been needing Innovative

307
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,880
technology for for years now so it's

308
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,040
something that we're passionate about

309
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
and I think if we can play a part and

310
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,360
make the role of the CFO a little bit

311
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,010
easier I'd be proud of of what we're

312
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:53,740
building

313
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:53,740
