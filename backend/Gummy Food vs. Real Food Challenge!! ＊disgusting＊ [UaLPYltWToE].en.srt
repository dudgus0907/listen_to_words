53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
out of 10 that's a 10 out of 10 gummy

54

to real food this is at the bottom cuz

58
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,080

gummy mix it should come with like a

229
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,760

307
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,920
gummies from today I agree good still

308
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,279

309
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,399
don't know guys are we not gumming

310
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:43,639

311
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,000
90 oh my God Nick you just broke a

312
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,639
childhood Relic and it was mine and it

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,680
was mine no I think that these just

314
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,360
aren't the particular gummies we like

315
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,040
and I think because you're not buying it

316
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,880
fresh like when I go into CVS and I buy

317
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,839
a pack of gummies I know that they're

318
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,680
like kind of a couple days old see when

319
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,399
I'm who how many people are buying a

320
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,120

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,760
this last time Nick just reminds me of a

325
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,600
