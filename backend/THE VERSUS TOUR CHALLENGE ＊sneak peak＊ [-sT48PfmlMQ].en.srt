00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,139
tour obviously we're gonna be playing it

149
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,400
a little bit differently right now the

150
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,259
rules are gonna be different during tour

151
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,300

152
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,100
balloon this is the pump this thing is

153
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,780
where the balloon grows and then pops

154
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,039
ready

155
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,580

[Music]

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,210
[Music]

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:25,019
I think these ones are stronger

161
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,019
[Music]

162
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,479
oh God okay these balloons aren't the

163
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,000
right ones so I'm pretty sure the clear

164
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,099
ones are stronger I agree

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,300
but that's one once again this game's

166
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,800
gonna be played differently than it is

167
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,900
on tour but right now you have to get

168
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
this green cup from the bottom all the

169
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,199
way through the cups back to the bottom

170
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,880
and then empty this tissue box with

171
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
tissues once again it's gonna be played

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
differently on tour but that's what

173
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,520

it's already team orange once again

202
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,740
gonna be slightly different than on tour

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,959
because you know this is just a little

204
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,660
preview but this game is not going to be

205
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,700
worth any points on tour instead it is

206
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,260
going to be minus points and that's all

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll say for now we're gonna play Big

208
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,800
Jenga and on tour we're gonna have a

209
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,140
limited amount of time that you can take

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,279
to pull your Jenga block so don't get it

211
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,380

212
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,380

233
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,800
so basically overall that's going to be

234
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,000
our versus tour with a little bit of

235
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
rule changes depending

236
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,279
the whole thing and we're keeping a

237
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,720
couple games a secret surprise for you

238
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,600

whole thing so if I don't win I'm never

241
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,880
editing a YouTube video again shut the

242
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,560
[ __ ] and I don't like to think of this

243
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,839
tour as a

244
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,500
um performance I like to think of it as

245
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,500
a YouTube video big giant um

246
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,459
no I had a word for it well it's also a

247
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,899
get together it's a big giant get

248
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,459
together it's like when people like you

249
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,260
know people want to pay to see people

250
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,300
compete because it's like people go to

251
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,920
sports games correct but at the end of

252
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,660
the day it's not even for y'all to just

253
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,680

254
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,200
of the day it's for y'all at the time

255
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,760
have a good time and meet each other

256
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,220
there's nothing more fun than hanging

257
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,720
out with people with common interests so

258
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,019
