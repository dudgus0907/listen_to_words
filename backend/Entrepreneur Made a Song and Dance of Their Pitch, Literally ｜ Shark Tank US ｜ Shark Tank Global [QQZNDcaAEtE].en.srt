[Music]

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,080
Hey, I'm Mia. Let me introduce the

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,720
number one jumpsuit, Mono Suit. Ladies

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,760
love jumpsuits, but the nature's call

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,160
his drama half naked in a restroom. Such

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,400
a mental trauma. Behold, I get the fix.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,119
No stress, no more lines at the ladies.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,399
Sorry, Kevin. You might not get this,

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,800
but this little prick you want. Buy mono

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,440
suit for your lady with the zipper in

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,160
the right spots and hit a jackpot.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Robert, do you think my mono suits

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,920
ironic?

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,800
It's iconic. Let me explain. Fashion

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,520
causes pollution. It's an undeniable

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,719
fact and it's time to react. All ladies

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
want that. I turn ocean plastics into

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,440
minus suit.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,560
It's my eco hack. It's my global impact.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,360
Circular life, zero waste, eco-friendly,

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,600
and it feels divine. We cleaning up the

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,320
ocean. One man suit at a time. Mark, do

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,080
you think I'm cute and funny? Then show

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,880
me the money charts. Together we'll

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,439
purify oceans and make our planet

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,880
cleaner. And with your help, we'll make

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,240
this world a whole lot greener. So check

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,000
out the money suits that you have right

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,680
over here.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,479
Outstanding performance.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,600
Thank you. Good job.

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,560
Wow.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
Good job.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
Um, can I have that one on the end?

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,159
Oh, that is so me.

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,640
Yeah.

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,600
So honored to be here. Uh my ask is 150

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
uh uh thousands for 5% of equity.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
Okay.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
And here's your little secret zipper in

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,759
the back.

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,759
Exactly. We got a patent for the zippers

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,399
on the butt because you know that every

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
every women can understand that

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
the most problematic thing is sitting

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
half naked in the restroom

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
because you need to remove it all. I can

48
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
do a demonstration a little bit if you

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
want.

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,560
So

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,440
it works like this.

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,480
Yes, it does.

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,360
It's very important to to say that my

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,599
suit is not just one piece collection.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
We have the whole sustainable line of

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,879
pieces including for example sneakers, I

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
mean accessories, I mean sleeves,

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
dresses.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,800
So you sell everything we see out there

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,120
from the sleeves to the shoes to the

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
gloves to the belt.

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,720
How much is it? So the average cost uh

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,680
retail price $290 per piece and the cost

64
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,800
to produce it is approximately $60. We

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,280
produce it in north Italy and it's made

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,200
from the recycled ocean waste.

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,879
The whole technology that we developed

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,640
maybe you know that the most polluting

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,599
thing in the ocean is actually fishing

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
net.

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,280
This is my mission and I explain why

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,319
because I was born in a small village um

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,400
in USSR. My dream was to become a

74
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,200
fashion designer, but we don't have any

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
money for to buy new clothes. So, I

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,159
actually literally upcycle all the

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,159
clothes into something I could wear.

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,280
So, Mia, what are your sales in the last

79
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,720
12 months?

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,720
Uh sales for the the past year was uh

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,720
$245,000.

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,040
And very important to to say that we did

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,840
not use any paid advertising.

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,120
Mia, how should I think of you? Should I

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,640
think of you as a fashion line or should

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,239
I think of you as a jumpsuit company?

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,640
So we are the fashion brand building a

88
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
sustainable community and technology at

89
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
the same time. I would say the core of

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
the business is the whole technology.

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,799
You can produce of course uh

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
but are they made out of all the same

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,280
material these bodysuits made exactly

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,280
from the ocean waste

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
right? What percentage of your sales are

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
your mono suit?

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,360
Approximately uh 70%.

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
Have you raised any money for that?

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,959
Yeah. Uh several years ago we raised $2

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
million from angel investments.

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
Wow.

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,400
And uh to

103
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
What valuation did you do on that 2

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,479
million? What did you say your business

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,080
was worth?

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,840
Uh 12 million.

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,440
12 million. 12 million.

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
It was in 2018.

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,759
But what happened?

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
Where did the 2 million go?

111
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
I will explain. So develop the uh two

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
collections per year. So to develop this

113
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
technology and let me explain about

114
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
technology. So currently clothing has a

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
linear life. All the things we are

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
wearing right now it will spend hundreds

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,919
of years until it bros down polluting

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,720
the planet obviously. So my suggestion

119
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,840
in my technology works like this. You

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,320
buy monu for us. You wear it. You return

121
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,400
it to us and we recycle it into

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,720
something new. So basically zero waste.

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,639
We just need money for develop it

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,040
further to make it really circular. Let

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,400
me let let me clear things up. Look, I

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,400
think they're beautiful. The challenge

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
is you're in two businesses, actually

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,199
three. You're trying to be an

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
eco-friendly business, you're trying to

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,039
be a technology business, and you're

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
trying to be a fashion business. And to

132
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,120
me, that's hard because they're all

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,280
expensive and they all require a special

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,280
focus. So, I don't see the ability to

135
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,479
pull all these pieces together in a way

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
that's affordable. So, for those

137
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,120
reasons, I'm out.

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
So, um I think the business is all over

139
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,000
the place.

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
And personally, I think if you just

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
focused on this jumpsuit thing and rode

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
that wave, you might make a lot more

143
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,600
money. Great presentation, great

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
product. Not for me. I'm out.

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Okay.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,720
Mia, I thought you were coming out with

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,800
a beautiful workout product to take on

148
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
Lululemon. I have no idea what business

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
you're in.

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't know if you're in a tech

151
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,880
business, fashion business, jumpsuit

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,520
business. I can't follow the uh the

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
bouncing ball. I'm out.

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
Let me explain uh also a little bit

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
further.

156
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
Can I mention one thing?

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
I thought this was the new Lululemon and

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,280
I was excited, but seeing all over the

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
place made me think that we wouldn't be

160
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,520
hyperfocused on making money through

161
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,759
this one outstanding product with the

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
great zipper in the back. Right. So, for

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,199
that reason, I'm out.

164
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,319
So, you're a very good designer. I love

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,039
what you've created. I would buy half at

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,440
least of what you have sitting here. But

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,080
my advice, I personally feel that

168
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
150,000 is nothing for you. Like

169
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,680
compared to what you're going to need, I

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,759
don't think this is the right investment

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,039
for me or for you. And for that reason,

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,199
I'm out.

173
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
Thank you. Thank you so much.

174
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
Thank you ladies.

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,520
Bye ladies.

176
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,759
Thank you.

177
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,759
Thank you.

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,479
I was a little bit disappointed that

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
people are continued focusing only on

180
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,720
making money but making money is good

181
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
but making money and making the planet

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
cleaner and making good for the planet

183
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,160
is much more important and big thing

184
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,960
that's why I was yeah I was I feel even

185
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
angry a little
