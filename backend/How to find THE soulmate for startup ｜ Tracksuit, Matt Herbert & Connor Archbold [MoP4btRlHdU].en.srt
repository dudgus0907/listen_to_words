brand tracking platform the best way to

34
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,159
measure top of funnel marketing the

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,439
problem that we're solving in in

36
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,439
marketing and brand building is there's

37
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,119
two jobs to be done the 95 and the and

38
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,840
the 5% the two jobs the 5% in any

39
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,280
category there are about 5% of people

40
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,439
who are ready to buy from you right now

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
and that's one job go and get those

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,079
people to buy from your your product and

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,320
your Brands but at the same time there's

44
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,240
95% of people who will come into the

45
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,000
category aren't ready to buy from you

46
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,079
right now but what are you doing to

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,759
build your famili familiarity and and

48
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,360
emotional closeness and and make people

49
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,520
fall in love with your with your company

50
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,680
and your brand so that when they are

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,520
ready to buy they're going to come and

52
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,560
buy from your business over the last you

53
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,720
know 15 years or so the world of

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,159
marketing has been so focused and

55
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,759
successful at measuring 5% of people or

56
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,040
the bottom of the funnel the sales the

57
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,479
conversions at the expense of the 95 and

58
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,520
so what we're doing at tracksuit is

59
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
building the best way to measure how

60
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,280
well you're building your brands with

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,719
the 95% of people that will come into

62
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,119
the category and they're going to choose

63
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,079
your brand essentially tracksuit we do

64
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,479
surveys of humans to find out what they

65
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,799
think and feel about Brands that's novel

66
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,280
because any company in the world hasn't

67
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,039
been able to afford this it's only being

68
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,720
available for Enterprise companies who

69
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,360
have $200,000 to pay for market research

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,599
reports that end up sitting on a desk

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,480
Gathering dust and we've created a

72
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,800
beautiful dashboard with you know we're

73
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,680
collecting surveys every single day for

74
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,280
7,000 Brands now globally we help those

75
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,680
marketers understand what people think

76
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,959
and feel about those Brands and how did

77
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,599

years later and tracksuit was sort of

86
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,040
started off the back of a weekly coffee

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
when we were figuring out what was next

88
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,840

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,519
wanted to ask is uh how would you

98
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,879
each other as friends but also as

99
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,599
co-founders colleagues however you want

100
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,840
to go about this but yeah how would you

101
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,760
describe each other who's going first

102
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,280
all right I'll start I'll start all

103
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,879

business partners Founders and so the

106
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,840
way describe Connor as a person as a

107
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,720
leader is just a little bit like a big

108
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,480
grizzly bear and what I mean by a big

109
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,959
grizzly bear okay is that he's the first

110
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,000
one to come over and give everybody a

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,360
big hug but every now and then he can

112
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,599
show a little bit of teeth and a little

113
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,000
bit of raw okay and he's the best at

114
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,439
just at at honestly at drive at driving

115
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,319
at driving forward and that's a a big

116
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,280
part that when we came together I mean

117
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,439
compliment child I know exactly what

118
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
Connor's going to say so that's why I

119
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,560
wanted to get in first he's like a big

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
grizzly bear he looks tough and scary

121
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
a big S but when he needs to drive he he

122
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,760
can drive really well all right there's

123
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,439
a reason the beard is just growing it

124
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,720

127
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,959
Matt um I think like he's the perfect

128
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,840

keeping us on task he's keeping us

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,680
focused and it's a really yeah it's a

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,320
nice combination and we work really well

142
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,759
together he also just like make sure the

143
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,080
team are focused if he sees a ball

144
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,199
bouncing somewhere he runs really

145
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,520
quickly no just

146
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,240
um but yeah it's it's a really nice

147
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,120
combo he's just super kind and always

148
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,080
has a smile but keeps you on task keeps

149
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,840
you focused and keeps you moving you

150
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,720
know I think one thing I think was is

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,479
worth touching on here and why this is

152
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,199
working why I just love working and and

153
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,199
leading tracksuit with with Connor is

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,120
that it's so complimentary and one of

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,199
the the very first I me couple of weeks

156
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,759
as we were coming in to start trackit

157
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,319
what we did is we did not only personal

158
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,319
Behavior profiling but team profiling

159
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,759
and so

160
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,360
this is where you say who do who do I

161
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,680
think I am as a person but what do my

162
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,400
teammates and what do my old colleagues

163
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,720
perceive me as and so you get this

164
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,880
really objective view around not only

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,280
what I think but what does my team think

166
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
we went through this exercise where

167
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,720
Conor and I both did this and it comes

168
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,520
out to say what is Connor what is Matt

169
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,440
where are our strengths where our

170
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,360
weaknesses but more so what are the

171
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,000
things just to watch out where's Connor

172
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,080
going to go and this is where Connor's

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,560
driving and really good and compliments

174
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,440
me and where are there where are the

175
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,360
some areas where you know I'm leaning

176
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,240
into to my superpowers or or My areas

177
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,759
but just knowing where we might cause

178
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,280
tension where we might see the world in

179
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,599
different ways and so having that as a

180
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,120
framework about who we are how we

181
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,680
operate how we build and operate and

182
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,160
teams together I think has had you know

183
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,000
a really impactful and huge impact on

184
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,960
who we are as As Leaders as friends as

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,599
colleagues but also the type of culture

186
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,639
and teams that we're building at

187
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,880
tracksuit you know what your role is in

188
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,560
any given team situation which is quite

189
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,000
fascinating if you know that you're the

190
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,759
strongest creative Problem Solver or the

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
strongest driver you know that when you

192
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,360
see people struggling with a problem

193
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
that it's your turn to step in or you

194
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,599
know when you see people kind of

195
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,319
deliberating for too long it's your turn

196
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:50,840
to step in and drive it forward and just

197
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,720
make a call and so yeah once you

198
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,759
understand how you fit in with the team

199
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,080
you are able to kind of embody that

200
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,400
trait at the right time and so yeah it

201
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,960
was it was is fascinating to do that and

202
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,919
it has helped we've done it for every

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
single person we're now at 100 employees

204
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,840
everyone knows what their roles are how

205
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,479
they should and can interact with the

206
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,800
team super helpful and then you also

207
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:17,080
decided to become co-ceos that must have

208
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,840
also been a very intentional decision as

209
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,080
co-founders so maybe help us understand

210
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,440
how that decision was made I I mean when

211
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,720
we started truit we both were doing

212
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,720
everything it was just and because we

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,560
were bootstrapped it was just like half

214
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,599
the time you're doing demo if you close

215
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,039
customers they're your customers and you

216
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,120
run it and we're both sort of thinking

217
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,599
about product and iterating and it kind

218
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,280
of naturally started that way where we

219
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,560
were both kind of doing it all and just

220
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,039
talking about the opportunity and then

221
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,240
as we started bringing on team members I

222
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,000
think you look at what we were doing and

223
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,360
it's like this is perfect the way it is

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
like let's not upset the apple cat I

225
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,319
think Coos is it's a like it's a really

226
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,120
interesting thing that you have to be

227
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,840
intentional with and we redraft our JDS

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,800
almost every 6 months I'd say where the

229
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,240
company's changing really fast so we

230
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,280
need to adapt and change really fast and

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,879
so yeah it's that relationship has

232
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,639
updated what we focus on at any given

233
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,919
time has changed the main thing is that

234
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,520
we have to be really good at

235
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,960
communicating just maintain that like

236
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,400
solid connection ourselves yeah it's

237
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,919
worked so far and I think it would you

238
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,280
know we can hire better people into a

239
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,280
CPO position or a COO position who've

240
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,360
been there and done that and there's

241
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,880
almost a bit of a hack in Matt can be in

242
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,519
London being a CEO and I can be in New

243
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,479
Zealand being a CEO so it's like 247

244
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,560
coverage yeah it's double it's double

245
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,080
trouble yeah and I mean and I've heard

246
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I've heard a couple times where around

247
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,360
if you're a CEO or a Founder founder CEO

248
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,560
you're the one that gets the least

249
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,399
amount of feedback in the business until

250
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,000
you're really intentional about that and

251
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,920
so to be able to do that together give

252
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,080
each other feedback take on each other's

253
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,680
feedback and have that ongoing dialogue

254
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,880
is so important so that you know really

255
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
lines and clear on what we're trying to

256
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,160
do here at trackit but also you know see

257
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
the world in slightly different ways and

258
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,920
compliment but it's that ongoing

259
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,680
communication I don't know how founder

260
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,560
CEOs go around building and maintaining

261
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
rapidly growing business as well as if

262
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,839
you're going down and raising investment

263
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,920
when we went through that that's that's

264
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,720
two full-time roles and then that was a

265
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,040
great example of when we decided to go

266
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,519
and and raise Capital you know a lot of

267
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,600
Connor time was spent on on doing that

268
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,920
the upwards stakeholder management

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,440
investor relations while I was able to

270
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,079
lean into keeping the business going and

271
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,079
maintaining and and the momentum that we

272
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,560
needed so being able to split the roles

273
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,040
we needed with what the company needs to

274
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,959
do leaning to our strengths but being

275
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,839
able to do it together is is fantastic

276
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,760
highly recommend yeah that's great

277
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,079
highly recommend as long as you're good

278
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
communicators yeah as long as it works

279
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,399
and you don't let your OS get in the way

280
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,560
right CU you got to I think that's I

281
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,040
reckon that's the main thing that gets

282
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,800
in the way of Coos over time is just

283
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,640
someone gets a little bit offended that

284
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,600
some call was made or they're like you

285
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,320
stepped on my toes and then it's like sh

286
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,320
then everyone's doing best at any given

287
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,200
time and and we're both aligned with

288
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,640
that long-term Vision so keep pushing

289
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,440
keep moving and make it

290
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,880
work you've made the cooco format work

291
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,440
quite well so far and so if you were to

292
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,640
give advice to other Founders on the

293
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
structure like how would you recommend

294
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,399
what advice would you have on this

295
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,680
co-ceo idea basically what I recommend

296
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,440
it yes I would recommend it I think

297
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,600
recommend it with a couple of flags is

298
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,839
that we also knew each other we've known

299
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,120
each other for 8 years when we first

300
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,839
came into this we did that teaming

301
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,800
exercise who are we as people how do we

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,160
operate in teams how are we going to

303
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,600
work dynamically so that I know exactly

304
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,000
where Connor's going off somewhere like

305
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
great I'm going to let Connor go there

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,600
when I'm starting to really lean in or

307
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,839
or or fight for all I want Conor knows

308
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,160
that like there's a reason why Matt's

309
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,240
going on on on that area knowing who you

310
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,839
are and how you operate together is

311
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,399
really important we're seeing in new

312
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,880
zealands that the multi CEO is as a

313
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,680
thing I think we looked at sh sharesies

314
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,720
investment they have AO they've got AO

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,880
shes and New Zealand have a three EO

316
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,320
there are examples of where it worked if

317
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,560
we weren't really honest with each other

318
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,279
if we didn't really know who each other

319
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,279
were deeply it probably would fall over

320
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,600
and so recommend it but go into caution

321
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,959
just because it works for us doesn't

322
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
mean it's going to work for everybody

323
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,839
else but what we do want to do is prove

324
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,720
that we can build an incredibly

325
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,600
successful business but be really well

326
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
respected in how we grow and what

327
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,959
trackit is as a place of work and the

328
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,160
impact that can that we can have yeah

329
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,959
everything you jump into in business in

330
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,600
life like there's going to be an outcome

331
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,360
and it's either going to be accidental

332
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,639
or it's going to be designed the coast

333
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,160
of your relationship is not something

334
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,959
you can go into and be open to an

335
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,760
accidental outcome you have to

336
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:49,160
intentionally design the relationship

337
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,120
your what Your roles are how you

338
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,680
interact otherwise I don't think it

339
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,360
would end well and and people aren't

340
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,279
very good at doing that when things are

341
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,920
busy and when they're hectic people

342
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,959
forget that they leave it for too long

343
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,279
so if you think you're that way inclined

344
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,079
don't do the coasty thing if you're

345
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,040
willing to put in the time and the

346
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,320
effort go ahead maybe even rewinding

347
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
further if you go to your personal

348
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,720
backgrounds a little bit of your

349
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,800
upbringing and also what some of the

350
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,760
SEMA moments were that you think LED you

351
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,720
to getting attracted to this world of

352
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,360
startups and Technology I actually

353
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,399
started my career as a corporate lawyer

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,000
of all things kind of wasn't inspired by

355
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,839
that uh so much which is probably easy

356
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,800
to

357
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,800
imagine but

358
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,639
I like ended up raising a fund and

359
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,639
almost going into the VC route first

360
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,639
because I started Auckland New Zealand's

361
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,199
first accelerator program and that was

362
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,079
my like risk-free way of understanding

363
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,160
everything I could about startups jumped

364
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,440
into one of the startups that came

365
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,720
through that program and that's that's

366
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,240
when I met Matt now wife and I ended up

367
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,079
running a surf and yoga retreat in

368
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,279
Nicaragua at some point um inar yeah

369
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,199
yeah we spent a year there and so yeah

370
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,079
I'm I'm attracted by you know like kind

371
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,720
of trying new things I've always always

372
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,880
been a first principles thinker and I

373
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,639
think that naturally you lend that lends

374
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,680
itself to being in a startup and and

375
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,680
maybe being a Founder in particular so

376
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,639
yeah I think I was always going to end

377
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,720
up here and have had a nice Meandering

378
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,560
path getting here I also studied law and

379
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,199
science I never went and practiced law

380
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,920
but my first role in the world of tech

381
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,639
was being part of the Uber team that

382
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,600
launched Uber in New Zealand and so that

383
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,639
was you know big Tech Big Brand that was

384
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,279
coming across the other side of the

385
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,000
world and being involved in that and you

386
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,920
know startup mode but the backing of

387
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,480
what Uber was in 2015 2016 that was the

388
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,000
introduction to Tech and I said great

389
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,399
let's get let's keep going in the in the

390
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,399
startup world had the opportunity to

391
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,079
move to Sydney that's where Connor and I

392
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,680
move met on the first day back in New

393
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
Zealand Connor was off to New York I was

394
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
going off to Sydney that company was a

395
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,480
company called Mish Guru it was looking

396
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,360
after the snap uh Snapchat management

397
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,880

with leading agencies and Brands to

399
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,240
unlock Snapchat as a new channel and so

400
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,279
that was the that was the real the the

401
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,240

brands use news new channels we there

403
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,800
for you know 5 years or so and then

404
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
ended up back in New Zealand linked up

405
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,120
with Connor have always loved uh brands

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,160
have always loved um an entrepreneurial

407
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,079
spirit I guess growing up I ran

408
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,839
Landscaping businesses and and pool

409
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,519
cleaning and and car washing around the

410
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,279
neighborhood so I don't know whether

411
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,279
that's where my entrepreneurial Spirit

412
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,519
came from but then Tech mtech and then

413
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,360
now trackit tell us a little bit about

414
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,160
New Zealand what is it like to grow up

415
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,160
as a kiwi what is the tech scene this is

416
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,120
a it's a great a great question I always

417
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,720
like to get Connor's perspective on this

418
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
um Connor brings the the best of the

419
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
American and the best of the the New

420
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,000
Zealand

421
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,199
take s yeah I I was born in California

422
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,880
and moved to New Zealand when I was 11

423
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,399
so I kind of have a bit of both matx I

424
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,199
think I can dial up one or the other

425
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,279
depending on what we need at trackx at

426
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:48,320
any given time do we need wild ambition

427
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,759
optimism and uh Ching those dreams and

428
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
drive yeah a drive yeah or you know he

429
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,279
can turn on the sort of the cool chill

430
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,000
kiwi charm and and that's the other side

431
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,600
so I mean growing up in New Zealand is

432
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,639
amazing I always like to tell my

433
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,240
American and friends that like my first

434
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,199
week of school in New Zealand I got in

435
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
trouble for wearing shoes that's like

436
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,720
New Zealand culture it's so relaxed it's

437
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,199
a wonderful place to grow up the tech

438
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,600
scene I think is it's an exciting place

439
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,040
if you talk to investors around the

440
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,480
world a lot of them are starting to look

441
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,560
at New Zealand and Australia because

442
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,279
we've had a lot of success recently with

443
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,600
the likes of canva and just like some

444
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,639
big companies coming out of that part of

445
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,120
the world and and we're starting to see

446
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,319
second time third time operators or

447
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,279
Founders coming through we're known for

448
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,880
being highly efficient that's because we

449
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,440
haven't had a lot of capital previously

450
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,440
you're seeing these companies come out

451
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,920
that are highly efficient they've it's a

452
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,600
great place to test and learn and so

453
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,639
it's a bit of a beta Nation because

454
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
you've got a highly engaged small

455
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,560
population the things that are coming

456
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,319
out tend to have good product Market fit

457
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
they're highly efficient and then they

458
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:52,279
can kind of take the World by storm

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,199
relatively quickly I visited New Zealand

460
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,240
a few years ago and I learned that there

461
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,920
are more sheep than humans who told who

462
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,399
told you that everyone I think cows are

463
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
actually the most now cows okay got it a

464
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,199
lot of cows but there there is a big

465
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,120
agretech sector like in New Zealand so

466
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,199
yeah we have we have Rockets we have

467
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,480
agretech and now we have truit y there

468
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,880
we go and does that impact the way you

469
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,199
thought of or think of the way you build

470
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,519
a company in other words do most

471
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,560
entrepreneurs think to go Global from

472
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,920
day one because it's a relatively

473
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,959
smaller Market or are there people still

474
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,399
focused mostly on the domestic Market

475
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,319
the global from day one I think there

476
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,279
are so many different ways to build

477
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,959
business and what the aspirations are

478
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,959
and when you want to to take things

479
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,279
absolutely at some point if you do have

480
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,759
international intentions you need to

481
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,639
leave New Zealand I mean there's only

482
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,079
you know there's 5 A2 million people in

483
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,360
New Zealand there's 25 million people in

484
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:49,959
Australia so the same it's the same size

485
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,480
as California how many hundreds of cows

486
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,600
thousands of hundreds of millions but

487
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,800
when you look at so when you look at the

488
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,639
size of of New Zealand at 52 million and

489
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,800
and Australia at about 25 it's the same

490
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,800
as California and so depending on what

491
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,440
you're doing and where you're trying to

492
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,959
go absolutely people look you know

493
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,240
offshore you can still build big

494
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,760
business across Australia and New

495
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,959
Zealand for us for you know for Conor

496
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,480
and I with track we were so intentional

497
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,280
about the way that we wanted to grow

498
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,319
track a few scars and burns about trying

499
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,600
to go Global too fast and and and

500
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,640
product Market fit and that type of

501
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,120
thing so with trackx right from the

502
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,120
start we said hey look the back end of

503
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,839
the technology that we're doing needs to

504
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,760
be in a position that we can turn on any

505
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,559
Market in the world when we're ready but

506
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,600
we wanted to be super intentional about

507
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
the way that we built do we have product

508
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,440
Market fit are people paying us are we

509
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,880
solving real problems are we building a

510
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,960
great team are we building great brands

511
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,280
that then enables us to go and scale so

512
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
we started in New Zealand our New

513
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,640
Zealand customers said can you do this

514
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
in Australia great we moved into

515
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,679
Australia we started working with

516
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,679
Incredible Australian Brands like

517
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,600
Culture Kings and Bondi Sands and then

518
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,760
those businesses said hey look the us

519
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,559
we've got a whole lot of Revenue in the

520
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
US we're trying to figure out how to

521
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,240
position what our competitors are doing

522
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
where we should be spending our

523
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,679
marketing dollars and so we went into

524
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,039
know came into the US off the back of

525
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,039
our our customers the same into the UK

526
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,600
so we've been pulled into the markets

527
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,159
which has allowed us to scale a team

528
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,159
with our customers with product Market

529
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,880
fit but always from the start absolutely

530
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,039
Global from day one but not turning it

531
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,360
on straight away and I think being from

532
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,880
New Zealand and how intentional we are

533
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
with our company Matt and I when we

534
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
started we wanted to spend 50% of our

535
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,080
energy on what we were building and

536
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,480
creating a great product and and trying

537
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,320
but we also wanted to like spend 50% of

538
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,159
our energy on how we were building and

539
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,679
sort of taking a great culture in our

540
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,159
company and then kind of taking that

541
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,360
culture to the world so we do have four

542
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,280
Global offices now we've got Sydney New

543
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,960
York and London on top of our our New

547
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,960

tracksuit culture to the world while

549
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,720
making like a good amount of room and

550
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,720
and setting space for that kind of local

551
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,280
flavor to be a part of that in each

552
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,840

553
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,120
can you share the story of hanging out

554
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,039
with Sam Alman in Auckland I was

555
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,240
launching Oakland's first accelerator

556
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,679
program Sam Alman was like visiting New

557
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,880
Zealand I think on a holiday not to like

558
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,320
do anything official I just like

559
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,679
bothered him in his Twitter DMS for a

560
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
long time like hey you want to we go

561
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,799
you're from California do you like

562
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,120
surfing do you want to go no no answer

563
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,640
do you want to like do something I don't

564
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,919
know and eventually I got him like he

565
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,720
said oh that'd be great when I said

566
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,200
something like oh I can maybe get an

567
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,159
investor to provide like a big boat and

568
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,919
we could do a tour of the harbor and go

569
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,240
so first of all I didn't have a boat um

570
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,919
but he said oh that'd be great I'd love

571
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,080
to meet some New Zealand startups so I

572
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,520
went and found a 70ft boat from some

573
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,360
investor in New Zealand go and we all

574
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,799
went out on it but the investor was like

575
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,760
he was like a a fishing guy like he he

576
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:52,159
wanted to go fishing and he wanted to

577
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,640
show these American visitors the great

578
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:58,840
fish you can catch in New Zealand

579
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:01,360
harbors and Sam was vegan at the time

580
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,880
so like I got this boat but the only way

581
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,960
we could use it is if the guy could take

582
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,400
us fishing and so it was just like oh

583
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,480
I'm sorry man like we're hauling up all

584
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,280
these poor fish and you sitting there

585
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,200
just like chilling in the inside of the

586
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,520
boat talking to a few stups and yeah

587
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,240
anyway so that was that was my

588
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,640
interaction with Sam mman 15 years ago

589
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,000
