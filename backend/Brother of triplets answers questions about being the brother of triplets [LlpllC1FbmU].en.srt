1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
you like sausage I love sausage

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,400
you better go let me know what you think

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,280
I mean you could have grabbed it too I

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,599
probably just ate it like I did

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,900
and then what you're saying how you miss

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,900
me

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,649
[Music]

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,199
[Music]

9
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:38,399
it's not that bad and eat McDonald's

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,140
breakfast at the same time

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,860
I think I really regret eating a whole

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,020
one in the shower a whole what

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,940
this whole thing taking one more bite

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,440
what

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,879
you're giving up after is it that good

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,920
like the first three that you buy the

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,739
whole thing and then just

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
my thought is more of like

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,199
skin of the whole thing you took a bite

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,760
so I'm already cutting off rashford

21
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,080
exactly

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,960
regardless the whole thing it's like

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,939
yeah neither can he just took a part of

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,939
it off let me get a bite let me get it

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,260
okay Matt such the type of kid to just

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
get two hash browns like we asked you

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,200
guys if we adjusted in the car then have

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
it on his lips what questions to ask him

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
and you guys did that

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,780
but no one's pulling it up so I'm gonna

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,299

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,220

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,400

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,140
bit of a better name what is it you

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,380
never even it's a little new Justin

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,360
hello we found him we met when we were

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,939
in third grade and he wasn't like

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,280
seventh and um

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,020
we went to the grocery store and he was

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,220
there shopping for his groceries and we

41
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,780
were like you know what this man looks

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,520
like people looks like Indian's guidance

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,799
he looks like he needs a place to put

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,320
those ever since that day

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,200
is lived under our roof or brought his

46
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,000
groceries home stop being a [ __ ]

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,799
just kidding he was there we were born

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,060
but

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm sure there was a moment where

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,939
someone saw him at a grocery store I was

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
like I'm gonna pick him up and bring him

52
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:15,379
home tough to find me at a groceries

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,379
people are weird why can y'all cuddle

54
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,180
I think we should explain to them beat

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,500
up Justin Time I think that's a good

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,120
thing I think it's a good thing to talk

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,160
about I mean it's pretty self-explained

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,900
I agree there was a moment of the day I

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,520
was dedicated to beating up Justin and

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,720
it was called beat up Justin but you

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,280
loved it

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
at all times you know I might not have

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,180
been the best brother so I gave them a

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,580
little moment you know maybe to shine

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,860
five or six minutes and they were like

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,420
little [ __ ] Gremlins but it wasn't

67
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,220
even five to six minutes it was like

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,800
hours of fighting no no it wasn't it

69
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,440
you guys

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,140
do what you could

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,540
have like frog bird and like it had to

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,560
it we did it for maybe a I don't know

73
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,560
how long do you think though

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,360
it's gone the reason why I thought that

75
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,220
was fun just because like Justin would

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,659
be in his room playing video games or

77
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,879
just doing whatever you're doing in your

78
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,319
room just take a little breather I'd be

79
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,940
like coloring Nick would be eating

80
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,860
cereal and Chris would be like upstairs

81
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,780
doing whatever you'd come downstairs

82
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,760
just screaming no matter what we were

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,300
doing everything was getting dropped and

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,800
running at it yeah ready to go

85
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,760
I remember wiping my ass once and just

86
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,760
like beat up Justin Time

87
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,080
you ever want a sister instead of a

88
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,879
brother

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,260
um so I have a step sister she's a

90
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,440
little older

91
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,959
um I had her you know before I knew

92
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,720
these guys

93
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,400
but in this house I always wanted at

94
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,840
least one little brother for sure that

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,080
was definitely what I wanted just wanted

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,239
a little brother and I got got three

97
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,099
craziness boom

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,980
I was actually just like Bonkers like

99
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,840
wanting one sibling and then yeah just

100
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,780
wanted a little guy to just kind of hang

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,239
around with and you know do Legos and

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,580
three oh were you like amped up when it

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,859
was three three I don't even know how I

104
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,720
even reacted like you were just probably

105
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,100
like didn't make too much sense to me

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
yeah because I didn't I don't even think

107
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,759
at that point I definitely didn't know

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,100
of any like triplets like when you guys

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,180
were oh yeah born whatsoever that's so

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
crazy

111
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,479
so I probably didn't even know that that

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
was a thing isn't it crazy you mad ass

113
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,919
when we were born and were you like we

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,720
didn't like we never like met you we

115
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,520
were just kind of like with you yeah I

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,900
think of that all the time people like

117
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,580
we were bored and then it was kind of

118
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,620
just like yeah there's like no ideas

119
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,479
your older brother and he's gonna be

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,940

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,460
time they just change on me it used to

131
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,080
be

132
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,520
um like the nacho cheese ones when I was

school that's like all they had so I was

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,180
banging those out and actually started

155
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,280
to enjoy them when Nick had buffalo

156
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,080
chicken in his room and then left it

157
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,580
under his bed yeah

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,199
make a face for me when you're doing

159
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,600
[ __ ] like that because my thought is

160
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,699
that never happened chicken in my room

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,380

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,180
be opened there was there was you had

163
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,580
two windows on the door no but I'm

164
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,620
saying

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,919
no like

166
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,919
I was mad

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,100
he couldn't open the windows that just

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,479
didn't open because someone was gonna

169
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,919
climb to the second floor of the house

170
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,960
and cough in his window I'm just saying

171
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,940
we were all like no one no one went

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,360
outside you know you can still open a

173
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,340
window I don't think was it uh yes you

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,600

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,520
them outside your room is what you're

176
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
saying no I ate no matter what the trash

178
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
ate the buffalo chicken and then I

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,900
didn't USA I kept it under my bed I ate

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,340
it and then I maybe fell asleep after

181
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,280
eating and then threw it out in the

182
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,539
morning no no no four or five plates in

183
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
that room at a time because in a weird

184
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,560
position of the house where there wasn't

185
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,300
a ventilation to make the smell leave so

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,800
I ate something in there thank you for a

187
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,800
while especially when it's old

188
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,240
adds too much Aroma to the [ __ ] where

189
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,919
it's just spicy at that point what

190
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,819
I'd rather sniff someone's [ __ ] than

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,819
Febreze [ __ ]

192
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
and you spray Febreze and you're trying

193
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,280
to mask the smell that [ __ ] with the

194
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,199
Febreze it's just not there's too much

195
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,900
[ __ ] talk going on I'm chilling funniest

196
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,639

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,620
oh word all right gotcha

245
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,940
what is this no idea

246
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm a Terry we just got kicked out by

247
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,940
[ __ ] mall cop yeah like what over

248
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,000
here is he drinking are we even in a

249
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,200
parking like a bad spot

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,360
we do this whole time goodbye buddy

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,160
that's crazy I can't like pull out like

252
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
dude what is he so worried about is he a

253
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,180
cop like is he in like a I thought he

254
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,740
was gonna try and Rob us are we on like

255
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,540
private property I don't know about and

256
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,279
the dude he's just in a Honda Civic

257
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,140
correct what is he a detective and then

258
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,580
we just like I just can't believe that

259
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,580
that just happened to me

260
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,279
we found another spot that has a some

261
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,839
overhead so we don't it's raining right

262
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,700
now so we parked in our underground spot

263
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,260
but we also

264
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,459
I've never had that happen to us I think

265
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,800
it's because it's like super early I

266
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,200
think Buddy's just nervous on guard like

267
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,000
he's like it's his time to defend it's

268
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,440
Batman in the night except it's not dude

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
he didn't have one thing that identified

270
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,160
him as like a person of authority

271
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,420
invisibility or teleportation

272
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,880
teleportation yeah it's really not close

273
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,800
I'd love a naughty people I love a combo

274
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,060
of them combo would be pretty cool I

275
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,620
know like this building would always be

276
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,740
pretty sick but it's like you can just

277
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,700
do you want to know you want to hear me

278
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,700
invisibility we get old in a week

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,700
teleportation but

280
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,860
I'll just teleport when I feel like I'm

281
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,060
supposed to be invisible like if I want

282
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,060
to be invisible in that scenario

283
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,320
you are invisible my thought is if you

284
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,640
teleport fast and stuff you're like

285
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,740
invisible to like maybe the human eye

286
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,540
like if you like imagine if you could

287
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,399
teleport faster like flash like he's

288
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,380
kind of just teleporting but like also

289
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,839
it's like if you could teleport really

290
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,339
quickly like the first thing I do is go

291
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,740
rob a bank right

292
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,300
and it's like if I can if I can like

293
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,640
teleport I'm just in the safe and I'm

294
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,620
out correct and also if you're if you

295
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,300
can teleport I imagine since it's like a

296
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,279
I know I'm going oh my God Nick like

297
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,560
don't say all that because it's not

298
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,320
realistic but we're talking about

299
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,899
yourself don't shoot me but I imagine

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,600
that for people who can teleport it's

301
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,160
faster than the speed of light

302
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,019
what the [ __ ] did you when I'm thinking

303
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,060
teleport I'm thinking I want to be on

304
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,279
the top of Mount Everest right now boom

305
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,500
amen correct agreed now would you not

306
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,140
would you care to agree that that's

307
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,060
faster than the speed of light way

308
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,560
faster I mean if you can go from here to

309
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,820
them that's why I'm saying the speed of

310
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,680
light in order to get picked up this

311
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,820
light like isn't that quick

312
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,079
it looks insanely quick but isn't it

313
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,600
so that's my thought it's like if you

314
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,800
teleport faster you'd be invisible why

315
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,000
would you want to be invisible oh so you

316
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,220
can go to this person's like whatever

317
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,480
like go in the bank or go this that like

318
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,579
why would you like invisible so you can

319
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,260
go to this person's voice it's just

320
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,079
teleport quick you know practically

321
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,700
invisible because I can't see it because

322
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,139
you're going faster with this pizza I

323
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,540
think I like what I'm teleporting like

324
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,380
yeah people can't see you but like sorry

325
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,380
I had a good idea

326
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,360
scare someone you don't like but you can

327
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,519
teleport faster than the speed of light

328
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,339
so you teleport like someone and go and

329
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,440
then teleport back

330
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,579
like this

331
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm like oh my God

332
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:11,639
thing yeah

333
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,500
this is gone yeah just nowhere it's not

334
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,820
like you're like 10 feet behind him

335
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,579
you're like that ass like another

336
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,800
country

337
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:22,260
middle of Saudi Arabia

338
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,760
apples are pancakes waffles easily I'll

339
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,760
defend waffles in my whole life yeah

340
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
pancakes have too much like potential to

341
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,920
go the wrong way for me I just hate

342
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,440
butter

343
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,820
right you know I know if I'm just throw

344
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,380
it in the Press you're good correct I

345
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,779
know if I order a waffle I'm like 50

346
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,519
gonna be happy like if I'm a pancake I'm

347
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,660
at like 10 like oh this is gonna be I

348
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,980
personally I don't think I've ever made

349
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,480
a waffle though I don't think I've ever

350
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,579
actually fizzled we need to get one of

351
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,500
those what are we doing we need it

352
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,660
waffle maker one thing that blows my

353
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,760
[ __ ] mind is that waffle batter is

354
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,279
the same as pancake batter it's just a

355
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,740
different do you guys know that it's the

356
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,440
same thing I never really never wanted

357
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,740
to hear that again

358
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,899
legit waffle batter and [ __ ] is the

359
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,920
exactly just my point of view on

360
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,660
everything because I don't think you

361
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,100
understand what that did because you

362
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,500
thought they were completely no no no

363
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,540
because I was when I was a little kid I

364
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,519
had chocolate chip waffles and I said

365
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,260
chocolate chip pancakes are way better

366
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,880
when in reality I'm eating the same

367
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,500
thing she's in a different shape well

368
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,899
Matt maybe it was just the chocolate

369
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,940
chips you basically just said we said I

370
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,820
honestly are you stupid he just said

371
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,959
what we said to be fair is he stupid

372
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,339
little I used to have chocolate chip

373
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,380
waffles sounds like chocolate chip

374
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,540
pancakes would be so much better but

375
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,860
it's like yeah we all would sound stupid

376
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,120
if we said that and Nick thinks like

377
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,680
everyone's gonna relate to him right now

378
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,380
so he thinks he's like well because Matt

379
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,339
said it like he's

380
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,480
was he trying to make a different point

381
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,279
he's having a different point just

382
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,500
because what was the chocolate chip the

383
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,940
point was saying like I'm surprised that

384
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,560
it's the same batter since I think

385
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,120
pancakes are better than waffles with

386
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,079
chocolate chips yeah but everyone was

387
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,699
saying that but he's like talking about

388
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,199
like he's been waiting on emphasis on

389
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,940
the chocolate chips are you different

390
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,899
agreeing with what we've been saying or

391
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,899
bullying

392
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,339
it was like oh chocolate chip like it

393
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,899
was something crazy and new and it's

394
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,519
like it's all right it doesn't affect

395
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,019
the back no it actually makes it more of

396
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,600
a fact because it's like if you were to

397
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,100
get a pancake in a in a waffle and you

398
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,079
dump like some random mystery ingredient

399
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,000
on it right like say you put like like

400
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,040
[ __ ] like so I'm not following so you

401
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,440
think just straight up no nothing in

402
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,600
them waffles are better but with the

403
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,800
pancakes with the pancakes chocolate

404
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,779
chip because they're more like they're

405
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,940
not inside or like what those are the

406
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,579
waffles I feel like I think it's because

407
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,320
it's like it's like it's not I think

408
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,639
with one you're chewing like that you

409
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,079
don't want some nice warm soft chocolate

410
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,540
you want you feel like it just doesn't

411
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,399
melt as enough into the water yeah I

412
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,019
feel you ever get annoyed at Christmas

413
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,079

414
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,800

you ever jealous

416
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,959
I think the funny part is like watching

417
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,860
when we watch those Christmas videos

418
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,720
back Chris opens a gift that like he's

419
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,579

420
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,279
