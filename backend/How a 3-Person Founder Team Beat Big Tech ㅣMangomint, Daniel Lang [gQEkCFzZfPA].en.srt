1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,279
I think it would be foolish to believe

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,120
that if you're competing against

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,720
companies with thousands of employees

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,360
and hundreds of millions of billions in

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,480
revenue and you can just show up with

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,679
like a threers Founder team and after

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,480
like one year of work you're just better

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,119
right that's just not how it works right

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,279
you start out by not having very much of

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,400
a competitive Advantage other than you

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,840
the founders and what you can bring to

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,000
bear with a product for very small

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,840
specific Niche and so then over time

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,960
what was the initial Niche the smallest

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,960
Niche God man

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,399
hi my name is TA I'm a partner at altto

17
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,920
ventures we are very excited to have

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,440
Daniel Lang here from mango mint welcome

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,760
Daniel thanks for being here thanks so

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,160
much for having me I'm excited to be

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,559
here I'm Daniel Lang I'm co-founder and

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,120
CEO of mangement mangement is software

23
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,199
for salons and spas what that means is

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,199
that we provide an operating system that

25
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,760
allows Beauty and wellness businesses to

26
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,280
do everything from scheduling

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
appointments taking payments marketing

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,680
to clients all the way through to

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,880
Payment Processing actually we should

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,640
probably rewind a little bit to your

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,920
journey up to Mangan share us a little

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,799
bit of that Journey that you were on

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,280
sure so I grew up in Austria which is a

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,240
for those of you who don't know a very

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,840
peaceful quiet small country in the

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,479
heart of Europe know sometimes you hear

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,200
these stories of entrepreneurs that had

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,720
to overcome all of these obstacles and

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,119
challenges in their childhood I really

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,320
can't say that that was the case for me

41
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,960
but what I will say is that my dad had

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,799
like a small business it wasn't so much

43
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,000
much what he was doing it was more so

44
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,320
the fact that he ran his own business

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,560
and that that was a possibility that I

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
think opened my eyes to that being

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,960
something that you could in fact do and

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,640
then at the age of 12 I just fell in

49
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,240
love with programming started my first

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,479
real business with employees at the age

51
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,880
of 19 but at the same time being in

52
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,520
Austria it always felt somewhat limiting

53
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,920
because Austria and Europe for the most

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,799
part is not a place that is conducive to

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,079
entrepreneurialism taking risks and all

56
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,640
of that stuff so the first time I came

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,640
here to America it felt like wow this is

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,759
a totally different world I mean just

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,680
like in Austria failure is something

60
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,239
that has a big stigma attached to it

61
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,039
whereas here it's almost like embraced

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,280
it's not that people enjoy failing like

63
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,879
failing still sucks but it's something

64
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,000
where if you fail as an entrepreneur and

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,840
you give it your everything nobody is

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,560
going to judge you for that right like

67
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,120
in fact they might high five you so I

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,000
was like immediately struck by that knew

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
that this was the place that I wanted to

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,040
start my business share with us a little

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,840
bit of the the early days and in

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,120
particular what was the journey to

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,519
saying I must build software for the

74
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,040
salon and spa industry totally one of

75
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,840
the things that was really important to

76
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,319
us when we started mangement is to find

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
something that we could truly be

78
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,480
passionate about for 10 15 20 years for

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,840
like the length of the journey you know

80
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,760
we spent about a year just looking for

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,879
different things and staying open-minded

82
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
during that time my wife and I we went

83
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,680
on this road trip I think we visited 32

84
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,239
different states basically visiting all

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,840
of these different places the one thing

86
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,920
that I noticed is that every town in the

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
America no matter how big or small tends

88
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,959
to have a lot of these like small

89
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,840
businesses local businesses that are

90
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,319
literally everywhere and at the time

91
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,519
this is 2016 coming from La I was

92
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,959
already used to using Uber and you know

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,840
Uber Eats and all of that modern

94
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,879
technology and yet when it came to

95
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,400
booking a herir appointment or booking a

96
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,080
wellness treatment it felt like you know

97
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,720
it was back in the '90s where you had to

98
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,239
call at a certain time and they had to

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,879
get back to you so we started to notice

100
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,239
that there might be an opportunity so

101
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,840
you go on this tour you wrap it up with

102
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,360
your wife you come back to LA and then

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,080
you say what we the co-founders and I

104
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,200
made it a point to spend several months

105
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,000
going out and talking to who we thought

106
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
would be potential customers and we

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,360
basically said if we can't get to them

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,360
now why would we be able to later so how

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,920
many customers pre-product did you in

110
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,920
some sense convince to use your

111
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,079
non-existent product yeah so one of the

112
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,640
challenges that we identified early on

113
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,400
was that none of us Founders had any

114
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,959
industry experience so none of us had

115
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,799
worked in a salano or Spa before I mean

116
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,200
everyone's a client in the salano spa at

117
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:06,959
some point in their life but we didn't

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
really know how these businesses worked

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,280
in order to build a great product for

120
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,720
them we had to go way deeper than what

121
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,720
we could learn in like a 1-h hour

122
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,840
conversation with an owner to solve the

123
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,519
problem we decided to use a trojan horse

124
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,079
approach where essentially we offered

125
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,000
free marketing Services we would

126
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,919
literally just like walk into salons and

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,360
say hey we have nothing to sell but we

128
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,320
have a background in marketing and Tech

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,960
and we'd love to just you know hang

130
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,600
around here and in exchange we'll build

131
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,440
you a new website we'll do your email

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,240
marketing honestly in the beginning it

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
was actually hard to convince people

134
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,199
because they thought we were scamming

135
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,800
them and way but you keep trying and we

136
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,720
found our first 10 20 eventually 30

137
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,560
customers that way two years later in

138
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,440
fact we had a software product that

139
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,120
somebody would actually be like a normal

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,000
person would pay for without being

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,960
friends with us so so you studied the

142
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,400
market quite intensely you talk to

143
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,400
hundreds of salons before you go into

144
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,160
the space so you probably some really

145
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,199
deep conviction that this could work but

146
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,160
that doesn't mean that it will work and

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,000
so as you were selling the first few

148
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,680
dozen software tools to these customers

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,800
were there any points where you're like

150
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,479
maybe I'm wrong like maybe maybe this

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
wasn't a good idea I'm still thinking

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,520
that every

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,440
day no the space that we're in took us

154
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,880
about 2 years to build the first version

155
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,400
of the product and that version was very

156
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,639
incomplete as I mentioned it probably

157
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,680
took another at least 2 years maybe even

158
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
longer to have a product that I would

159
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,199
consider competitive and so that's a

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,840
very long time and you know in the early

161
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,160
days we didn't raise funding at the very

162
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,919
beginning so it meant that as Founders

163
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,639
we had to basically put in money

164
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,600
ourselves not only not getting paid we

165
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
put in money for several years I think

166
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,039
that is why you really need to focus on

167
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,319
alignment with your co-founders as well

168
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,440
and making sure that they also

169
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,039
understand the length of how long this

170
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,319
takes there's so much in my opinion bad

171
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,720
advice out there for Founders you know

172
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,560
the stories that sound really we oh we

173
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,120
met on a weekend hackathon and like you

174
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
know 3 weeks later we had shipped the

175
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,319
first version and 3 months later as AOA

176
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,240
invested what not right like yeah sure

177
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,599
that happens once every 20 years maybe

178
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,080
but like the reality for most Founders

179
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,520
is different right like the reality is

180
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,560
like in the early days you put in

181
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,479
everything you can and a lot of times

182
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,479
you know the initial idea is not the one

183
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,720
that works out and so you have to stay

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,479
Nimble and many cases pivot we were

185
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
fortunate in the sense that our thesis

186
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,800
didn't actually change but there are

187
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,639
definitely moments where you kind of to

188
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,639
convince yourself to just keep going

189
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,680
there were already a lot of players in

190
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,720
this category of Salon and Spa software

191
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,560
so it's a relatively mature market in

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,720
terms of software penetration yet you

193
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,759
found there to be a need for mango mint

194
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,680
to exist and flourish so how would you

195
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,280
characterize the fundamental competitive

196
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,759
advantage that you have in mango mint

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,080
yeah it's interesting cuz you know

198
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,960
having started other businesses before

199
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,120
and been around Founders you make a

200
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,120
choice or on like what kind of risk you

201
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,720
want to take and a lot of Founders take

202
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,560
Market risk where they have some great

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,319
technology to have an idea but it's

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,960
unclear whether there would be a market

205
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,840
for it we did not want to take that risk

206
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,440
we intentionally chose a market that had

207
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
a lot of incumbents already we saw that

208
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,319
as a positive characteristic about the

209
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,599
market rather than a negative one a lot

210
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,199
of times you know when you talk to folks

211
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,520
and you tell them the idea they're like

212
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,720
wait but doesn't this already exist like

213
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,120
yes that's the point it exists and

214
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,680
they're doing well and there's many

215
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,680
companies that are making lots of money

216
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,440
that's a good thing because then it

217
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,639
allows you to focus on strategy and

218
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,000
differentiation and how you can carve

219
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,120
out initially like a wedge and then over

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,360
time grow that wedge into a real

221
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,360
competitive strength I think it would be

222
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,319
foolish to believe that if you're

223
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,120
competing against companies with

224
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,800
thousands of employees and hundreds of

225
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,280
millions of billions in Revenue that you

226
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,159
can just show up with like a three

227
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,479
person founder team and after like one

228
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,960
year work you're just better right

229
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,840
that's just not how it works right so

230
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,280
you have to really be smart about okay

231
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,080
better for who right and like you know

232
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,479
probably start with a very small group

233
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,879
that's what we did and so you start out

234
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,440
by not having very much of a competitive

235
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,520
Advantage other than you the founders

236
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,759
and what you can bring to bear with a

237
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,400
product for a very small specific Niche

238
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,759
and so then over time what was the

239
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,479
initial Niche the smallest Niche it

240
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,240
wasn't actually like a a niche in terms

241
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,440
of like segmentation of the market it

242
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,800
was a niche more so around what people

243
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,599
wanted from it and so for example when

244
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,839
we launched we did not have Payment

245
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,080
Processing we did not have reporting we

246
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,519
did not have a Shopify integration so if

247
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,399
any of those things were important to

248
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,240
you we would not be a good solution for

249
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,360
you but what we did have was a calendar

250
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,880
that beautifully designed fast

251
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,000
interfaces intuitive I feel like a lot

252
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,880
of people who don't have a plan don't

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,200
have a strategy make the mistake that

254
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,200
they say yes to everything and it

255
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,240
dilutes them so much that you can't

256
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,959
really tell after a while what they're

257
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,519
actually good for and so I feel like you

258
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,440
know one of the things that we've always

259
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,920
done well is being very clear who is our

260
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,680
ICP who are we for who are we not for

261
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,920
what are we willing to say yes to and

262
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,040
what are we willing to say no to and

263
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,320
it's actually hard because when you have

264
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,640
somebody knock on your door and wave a

265
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,519
lot of money in front of your face and

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,399
say hey I need this thing can you please

267
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,880
build it for me it's very tempting

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,800
especially when you don't have a lot of

269
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,800
Revenue yet and you know also don't have

270
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,519
funding but it's those moments when I

271
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,360
think it really matters to be clear

272
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,480
about what your strategy is so that you

273
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,600
have the permission to say no in those

274
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,959
moments what were the most painful NOS

275
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,959
you've said today oh man usually the

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,160
ones where somebody shows up and says

277
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,800
hey I got 70 locations we love your

278
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,240
product we've already used it we've

279
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,760
already done the troll and we just need

280
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,040
this one little extra button or this one

281
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,600
little extra report or something can you

282
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,120
can you please build it and we'll be a

283
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
customer those are the moments where

284
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
it's really difficult to say no but so

285
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,279
far we've managed to do that uh but

286
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,360
certainly not with without like you know

287
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,160
feeling wow like a man that would have

288
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
been nice actually right right this is a

289
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,079
question from one of your close

290
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,680
colleagues Daniel has exceptional

291
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,959
intuition for building a great product

292
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,440
how would you describe your personal

293
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,720
philosophy of what it means to build

294
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
great product I love the question

295
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,120
because intuition is such a thing that

296
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
is underappreciated in traditional

297
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,560
product management for those of you who

298
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,839
don't know product management is a lot

299
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,440
of like lot about prioritization

300
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,360
which features do you build how do you

301
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,079
weigh them there's all kinds of systems

302
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,279
that you can use you can assign points

303
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,240
and impact scores and whatnot right and

304
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,959
what ends up happening is you end up

305
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,519
with unremarkable products because when

306
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:48,160
you apply such a rigid system to the way

307
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,519
you build product you end up optimizing

308
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,320
for a lot of boring stuff I think the

309
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,880
most exciting products the ones that

310
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,560
really like inspire people make people

311
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,800
truly feel love for a product are the

312
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,279
ones that have intuition in then where

313
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,440
somebody had a feeling that something

314
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,800
was a good idea and went with that gut

315
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,560
instinct that intuition if you call it

316
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,320
so now the question becomes what does it

317
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,519
take to have intuition and I think it's

318
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,200
with many things in life where to

319
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,120
develop intuition for anything you just

320
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,920
got to put in the Reps you just got to

321
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,079
see a lot right so if you want to be a

322
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839
product leader you have to try a lot of

323
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,839
products you have to be in the products

324
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,480
you have to be willing to try every

325
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,959
product and analyze it and form an

326
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
opinion what do you like about it what

327
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,440
do you not like about it why is it good

328
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,920
why does a product make you angry why

329
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
does a product make you excited what are

330
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,839
those like you know things that are

331
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,279
going on and a lot of times it's not

332
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,000
stuff that you can perfectly capture in

333
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,839
like spreadsheets like it's like the

334
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,440
little things right and that's what I

335
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,639
mean with intuition right like you need

336
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,040
to see a lot of products try smell taste

337
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,079
products to be able to tell when a

338
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,560
product is good and then also be able to

339
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,279
judge whether an idea or a feature is

340
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,519
good and I'd much rather make an

341
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,040
opinionated decision and be wrong about

342
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,920
it then crowdsourcing these decisions

343
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,399
and then always making the safe decision

344
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,760
so I I believe like you know being

345
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,440
opinionated having a philosophy with

346
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
what your product should be is very

347
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
important to building a product that

348
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,600
people at will really love at the end of

349
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,040
the day are you still involved in

350
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,639
product at the stage very much so do you

351
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,880
feel like you have to stay involved

352
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,240
there for a while or is there a point

353
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,399
where you think the system has to be set

354
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,399
up such that the PMS or product leaders

355
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,120
have the uh empowerment to make their

356
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,560
own decisions the short answer is yes I

357
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,680
think it will always have to be involved

358
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,959
I think it's actually crazy to think

359
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,000
that the CEO should not be involved in

360
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,959
product I mean product is literally what

361
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,120
you're selling and it's in some ways the

362
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,120
most important thing about your business

363
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,560
so how could you not be intimately

364
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,040
involved as a CEO that's the way I see

365
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,320
it now that being said you don't want to

366
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,360
create an environment where you

367
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,440
micromanage everything of course right

368
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,680
so you want to put in place people who

369
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,399
are able to act with conviction

370
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,120
themselves right but I think that's

371
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,839
different from letting them completely

372
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,680
decide what is getting built and not

373
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,440
being aware of it I think it is very

374
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,440
important to stay plugged in to have

375
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,600
that sort of cohesive vision for where

376
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,240
the product is going and keep doing that

377
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,000
I also believe that the way software is

378
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,199
built in many companies is not conducive

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,120
to great product outcomes and what I

380
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,959
mean by that is a lot of times you know

381
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,040
a PM product manager comes up with a

382
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,600
feature they spec it out they work with

383
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,760
design to create like a UI design sign

384
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,279
and then they hand it off to engineering

385
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,199
and then engineering builds something it

386
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,760
comes back there's some Q&A maybe some

387
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,440
back and forth but then it gets shipped

388
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,560
right we fundamentally believe that this

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,839
is not a good approach to building great

390
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,680
great products I think you can actually

391
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,440
build really decent products with it but

392
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,120
if you truly aspire to build the world's

393
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,680
best software you have to do it

394
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,079
differently you have to bring the

395
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,920
engineers the ones that are building the

396
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,880
codes that the ones that are living in

397
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,160
the code base into the mix and they have

398
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,639
to understand why it is they building

399
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,839
what they are building they have to

400
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,959
understand the customer and so many

401
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,600
times when they make decisions the

402
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,360
little of things they will spot

403
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,360
opportunities that a product manager

404
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,040
could never identify so it's really

405
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,680
important that you bring them on board

406
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,519
and some companies call it product

407
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,199
Engineers I think that's just like a

408
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,959
title thing but at the end of the day it

409
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,800
means that the product manager is not

410
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,800
the owner of the product they're not

411
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,639
dictating what gets built and how and

412
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,720
all the specs they're more like a

413
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,800
research function that is there to

414
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,880
assist the product development which

415
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
happens with engineers and designers and

416
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,320
the product manager informs that by

417
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,399
providing insights and perspective from

418
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,079
talking to customers and the market and

419
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,279
competitors and all of that stuff but

420
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,120
they are not like the mini CEO as

421
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,880
they're sometimes called for a feature

422
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,680
or a product they're more in like this

423
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,160
research and assistance role so in the

424
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,199
early days you bootstrapped you figured

425
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,079
out ways to earn some marketing dollars

426
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,959
here and there and you tged along and at

427
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,440
a certain point you decided to raise

428
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,279
some Capital so what was that moment

429
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,320
when you and your your co-founder said

430
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,079
let's go talk to some fec's I think it

431
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,440
was always obvious for us from the

432
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,199
beginning that the vision was so big

433
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,600
that at some point along the journey we

434
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,480
would have to bring in some outside

435
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,040
Capital to you know just like make the

436
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,639
necessary Investments to hire the team

437
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,360
build the product and do all of that

438
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,880
stuff so it wasn't so much that we were

439
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,600
trying to figure out should we raise or

440
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,360
not it was more like okay when do we

441
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,720
feel like you know there's enough there

442
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,040
that we feel comfortable taking someone

443
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
else's money it's a big responsibility

444
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160
you know if you take someone else's

445
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,759
money and beginning it's like you know

446
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,240
they say family friends and fools right

447
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,199
for a reason uh a lot of times they lose

448
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,480
the money right and we just wanted to

449
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,759
make sure that we felt really good about

450
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,120
it before we did that and did not lose

451
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,560
the money frankly what was the early

452
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,360
iteration of those pitch meetings like

453
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,519
what was the feedback I'm sure you

454
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
remember some of the NOS that you heard

455
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,759
like what was that like I mean it sucks

456
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,759
right like you know fundraising as an

457
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,480
early stage it's funny because in the

458
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,720
beginning when you start out doing your

459
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,880
pre-seed your seat round man it's such a

460
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,720
grind right like as a Founder unless you

461
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,519
have some prior background unless you

462
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,519
already are super connected and know

463
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,519
everybody in the industry if that's not

464
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,319
you then chances are it's not going to

465
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,279
be a fun experience it's just not how it

466
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,480
goes right even like you know getting

467
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,680
into a meeting is difficult in the

468
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,319
beginning and then later once the

469
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
business starts to take off a little bit

470
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:23,160
there's this interesting moment where it

471
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,839
completely shifts like all of a sudden

472
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,959
like you know the VCS and the investors

473
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,600
are the ones that are trying to get a

474
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,920
meeting with you and now you are in the

475
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
position where there's like way too many

476
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,040
many emails coming in and you're trying

477
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,040
to figure out like how to spend your

478
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,120
time so you actually start to appreciate

479
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,360
what it was like for the investors so

480
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,480
now you're in the driver's seat you can

481
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,160
make some decisions with all these VCS

482
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,880
knocking on your doors how did you go

483
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,279
about that process like what did you

484
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,120
optimize for and ultimately how did you

485
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,360
pick the right type of Partners to work

486
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,839
with over time you know for the series a

487
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,639
um which we did 2022 we actually ran a

488
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,959
very very short process I think it took

489
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,959
us like two weeks from first meeting

490
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,639
until we had term sheets and then like

491
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,199
another week to actually sign a term

492
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,199
sheet for C then series a rounds at

493
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,079
least in my experience it's all about

494
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,959
like you know do you have traction and

495
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,799
is the investor excited about the idea

496
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,880
and usually you know pretty early right

497
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,520
like 20 minutes into a conversation the

498
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
person who ended up doing a series a

499
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,799
Sanji from open view he literally like

500
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,280
20 minutes into our first conversation

501
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,120
stopped me and said all right what does

502
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,400
it take to win this deal like I don't

503
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,720
need to hear anymore like I've heard

504
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,079
enough like what does it take to win

505
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,880
this deal right and I feel like it's

506
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,480
almost obvious when you have that

507
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,080
meeting and you know oh wow like you

508
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,240
know this could be some something that

509
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,480
could work out I guess later on like you

510
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,600
know for where we are now it shifts a

511
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,000
little bit right because now it's no

512
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,960
longer the question of are you going to

513
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,919
get funded yes or no but more like okay

514
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,840
who is the best partner to help us

515
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,600
fulfill our vision and make this like a

516
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,120
really big meaningful company for the

517
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,080
long term right so even like you know

518
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,400
with Altos you know the long-term Focus

519
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,120
that you guys have that was really

520
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,360
important to us right and getting to

521
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,200
know you better and the team here and

522
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,039
how everybody thought like that was a

523
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,960
much bigger consideration than when we

524
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,039
raised our seed rant several years ago

525
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,880
for example if you're on that road trip

526
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,559
with your wife talking to the salon

527
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,320
owners maybe even before that as you

528
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,280
were thinking about maybe starting a

529
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,039
company what would you tell Daniel what

530
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,919
now8 nine years ago I would say the

531
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,520
thing that I did not appreciate at the

532
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,159
very beginning of the journey is how

533
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,120
incredibly long it would take to get to

534
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,240
a place where it really you can really

535
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,840
see the future you know everyone

536
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,200
understands it intellectually when you

537
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,159
say oh it takes like 7 to 10 years for

538
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,440
any company to be successful right but

539
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:38,600
when you're in it when you're like a

540
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,000
year three year four it can feel really

541
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,640
long and it's almost like this thing

542
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,919
where for the longest time you're just

543
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
trying to survive and then it hits you

544
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,360
finally where it's like hey I think

545
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,240
we're no longer fighting to to survive I

546
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,159
think you know now I can actually shift

547
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,640
around how big could this be but before

548
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,320
you hit that moment it's a real grind

549
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,760
and I would say if I could go back and

550
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,640
talk to me at the very beginning I would

551
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,400
just like really emphasize hey make sure

552
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,120
that you embrace it it's like part of

553
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,600
the journey don't get discouraged I mean

554
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,159
we didn't but still like it would have

555
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,679
been nice to hear that and and and to

556
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,679
know that this is what it takes

557
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,619
