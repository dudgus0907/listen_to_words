1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
when is it time to call it? When is the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,960
chapter closed? I think one big piece of

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,519
advice is I think we're often as

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,000
entrepreneurs, we have a lot of weight

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,599
on our shoulders and between Instagram

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
and Artifact, I did some angel

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,080
investment and it's never positive news

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
when an entrepreneur tells you that a

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
company doesn't work. But I've seen it

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,640
before, you know, and so it's not a

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
surprise that some companies don't work

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
out. That's baked into the model. And so

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,800
I guess the advice I would give is

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,559
really check in with your investors and

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
don't I've seen entrepreneurs get stuck

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,040
in this idea like I have to keep going

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
because my investor expects me to and I

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,680
think what they'll find is sometimes

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,239
investors are like you're trying you've

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,320
tried it all in this space. I think it's

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,680
time to to call it and that's okay. And

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
you know it's never it's never a

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,559
celebration but it doesn't have to be

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,559
you know a tragedy

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,000
either. I'm Mike Kger. I'm currently the

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
chief product officer um at Anthropic

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which is an AI company based here in San

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
Francisco. I co-founded Instagram and

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,600
was its chief technology officer from

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,200
about 2010 to 2018. So nice crazy

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,640
journey that we had there too. Started

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
one other company with the same founder

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,479
as Instagram called Artifact which was a

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,799
AI news startup and then uh joined

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,560
Anthropic just under a year ago. So it's

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,920
been the kind of third chapter in my

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,720
professional career and it's been it's

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,720
been a lot of fun so far.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
Credit my dad for a lot of this. He

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
brought home a computer for us when I

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,000
was about four. I remember it had it

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
around Microsoft Daws still. It didn't

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
even have Windows. But one of the things

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,439
that was very cool is you can just type

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
edit and you would be able to open up

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,759
the files and all the even the apps that

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,280
came with the computer. And so I think I

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
liked taking things apart and putting

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
them back together. And I think I really

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
liked seeing how things worked. So it

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
sparked very early for me when I was

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,159
just four. when it came time to decide

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,479
what my career was going to be. What was

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
interesting was in Brazil at the time,

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
there wasn't really the same kind of

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,880
technology industry as there is today.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,640
And so I didn't have any friends or

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
parents friends who were working in

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,159
tech. And so I didn't really see it as a

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
career for me. I just thought it was a

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
thing other people did. And so it

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
actually only really took me until I

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,760
came to California that I realized that

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,360
this childhood interest that I had

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
actually was something that I could do

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,599
as a career and and make a whole living

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,680
off of.

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,080
When I got to Stanford, I discovered

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,319
that they had this degree program called

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
Symbolic Systems, which only Stanford

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
has, and it's kind of this little

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,280
strange program that when I was there, I

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
think per year they had about 40 or 50

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,319
students, and now I think it's more than

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
200. So, it's really grown, which is

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,000
great. What I loved about it is that it

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,920
wasn't just computer science which I was

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,400
interested in but it also included

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,239
design it included philosophy included

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
psychology and it was really you think

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
about the idea of the program it's not

82
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
just to study computing it's to study

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
the the whole context around why we

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,640
build software that was really powerful

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,480
for me because I knew I liked design and

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,120
I liked making things useful for people

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,280
but I also liked the actual building you

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,879
know of those things so I think a few of

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,360
the things I really came out of that

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
program with one was this idea that

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
everything you build should solve a

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
problem for somebody, right? It's like

93
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
kind of the core of design thinking that

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
you identify problems, you figure out

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
how you can best solve them after doing

96
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,480
the research and then you validate what

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,000
you've built to make sure you actually

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
solve those problems. I think that is

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
really important and that's a big piece

100
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
of what I what I came out with. The

101
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,840
other is the value of prototyping. So,

102
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
you know, instead of just working for 6

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
months on a project and then showing it

104
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
to somebody for the first time and then

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
it turns out you got something really

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
fundamentally wrong, willing to build

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,680
prototypes, show them along the way and

108
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
open up the design process a lot more.

109
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
And maybe the last one is the value of a

110
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,680
good team um and having the right

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
partners. So, person I co-founded

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Instagram with is somebody I actually

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,159
met back at Stanford. At the time, we

114
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
didn't know we were going to start a

115
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
company together, but I knew that

116
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
partnering with the right person,

117
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
especially that somebody that has

118
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
similar skills in some ways, but

119
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,000
different skills in other ways, and they

120
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,360
can complement you, um, can make the

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,640
difference as well for the company

122
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,200
succeeding. For example, there's a brand

123
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
new built-in camera. Now, the camera is

124
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
another way that the iPhone 3G has

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
really changed how people use their cell

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,000
phones. The new iPhone 3GS, there's a

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,000
brand new 3 megapixel autofocus camera.

128
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,080
It takes pictures that are even larger,

129
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,240
even more beautiful.

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,800
You have to kind of rewind your uh time

131
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
machine back to 2009. Now we take for

132
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
granted that everybody uses a lot of

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,919
apps on their phone, that we take a lot

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
of photos on our phone and that we

135
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,160
network or we, you know, use social

136
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
media on our phones. But in 2009, that

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,199
wasn't the case quite yet. So the

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
cameras were getting better, but they

139
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,880
were still quite bad. Facebook had a

140
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
mobile app, but um it was kind of that

141
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
early one where it was kind of just

142
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,320
trying to recreate the website on the

143
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,639
mobile side and it wasn't quite as a

144
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,960
native and there were very few sort of

145
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
new social products coming out and the

146
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
context is important because the reason

147
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
I got really excited to collaborate with

148
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
Kevin who ended up being my co-founder

149
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
is that he wanted to change all three of

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
those things. So he was building time as

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
a location sharing site a little bit

152
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
like Foursquare if you remember

153
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
Foursquare but with photos and videos

154
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,759
attached as well and really creating a

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
social experience when you're out and

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
about. That was really exciting to me

157
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
because I saw the potential for mobile

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
device to create a much more personal

159
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,039
connecting experience. So first moment

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
was reconnecting with Kevin and seeing

161
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,240
that he was interested in these ideas.

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
Second important moment was me getting

163
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,919
my work visa so I could go work with

164
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,520
him. So I was first had to transfer my

165
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,960
work visa and that actually took four

166
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
months. And then the third important

167
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,560
moment was us realizing that product

168
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,240
that we were working on it was called

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,840
Bourbon Burbn which was a that sort of

170
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,759
location-based check-in location sharing

171
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,199
app was good but it was not product that

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
was really going to where we wanted to

173
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
go and so we had a moment where we had

174
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
to take a pause really peel back all of

175
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
what was not working about the product

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
and realized that at the core the piece

177
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,960
that was really working was this uh

178
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
aspect about taking photos sharing what

179
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
you were doing and connecting with

180
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,919
people that way. And that was really the

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
the moment where we took a lot of

182
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,000
distracting things, stripped them all

183
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,600
away and then focused on what would

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,319
eventually become

185
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,319
Instagram. I think a lot of the art and

186
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,000
it's a part both art and science of

187
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,479
building great products especially with

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,240
emerging technologies. So Instagram it

189
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,639
was the rise of the mobile phone.

190
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,560
finding the technologies that are ready

191
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,160
for broader adoption than they currently

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,000
have and then finding how do you build

193
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
the product around it to make it usable

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,080
for many many people that's a common

195
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
sort of through line and I think the

196
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
kinds of things you can look for in

197
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,080
terms of that early energy is are there

198
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,840
some people already starting to do

199
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,600
something interesting in the space but

200
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,600
it's all the early adopters that's an

201
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
interesting kind of area um the other

202
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
thing I look at often is the rate of

203
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,039
change so if you look at the iPhone 3 to

204
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
the 3GS to the for and you look at the

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
quality of the photos and the quality of

206
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
the networking um stack and the ability

207
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,479
to connect, you can see the jumps. So

208
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,560
you're like, okay, if it goes one or two

209
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,720
more jumps, it's going to be incredible.

210
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,639
Same with LLMs. I joined Anthropic. We

211
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,160
had just come out with Cloud 3 and Cloud

212
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
3 was our first model that really

213
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,319
started to get more usage. It was still,

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
you know, limited in a lot of ways, but

215
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,599
then you see the next we did cloud 3.5

216
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
and that was a big leap. So you can

217
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,240
imagine that you're going to continue to

218
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,000
get these large jumps. And so as a

219
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
product builder, you have to start

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
thinking, I want to build a product

221
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,520
that's useful today, but is also ready

222
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,000
to catch the wave of what the next big

223
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,280
leap is.

224
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,560
You've closed uh the Instagram

225
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,639
acquisition. Why did you do it and what

226
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
are you going to do with it? Yeah. So

227
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
Instagram is great, right? I mean,

228
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,039
they're um they're this super talented

229
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
group of of engineers. They're building

230
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,199
this amazing product. Um they just

231
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
crossed 100 million registered users and

232
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
they're killing it. They started off

233
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,520
building on top of our platform. You

234
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,880
know, you can take pictures with

235
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
Instagram and you can share them to

236
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,400
Facebook. Um, and it's it's really first

237
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
class, right? So, sharing a picture from

238
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,360
Instagram, it basically appears exactly

239
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
the same as if you shared a photo on

240
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
Facebook. So, it's great. They did a

241
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
really good job with that. Our mission

242
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,919
around Instagram is we think Instagram

243
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
is amazing and we want to help it grow

244
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,759
to hundreds of millions of users. We

245
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,440
want to help them out um with with

246
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
whatever we can. Um, but we we have no

247
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
agenda in terms of making them go onto

248
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
our infrastructure or something. A lot

249
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
of times companies um force companies

250
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
that they're integrating to do stuff

251
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
like that. I think it's primarily a

252
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,360
waste of time. We're not going to do any

253
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,639
of that. We're going to just try to do

254
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,319
the things that that we would have done

255
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
if they were an open graph partner, but

256
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,120
now we can prioritize them more highly.

257
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,319
I mean, they can do a lot of them

258
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,440
directly because they have access to our

259
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,199
code directly.

260
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,120
I like to say that at Instagram, you

261
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,279
know, before the acquisition, we didn't

262
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,919
yet have a company. Um and what I mean

263
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,760
by that was we were 13 people had some

264
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
ideas around revenue, but we hadn't

265
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,360
built any of them out yet. still very

266
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,880
much that like early startup. Joining

267
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
Facebook was really interesting to me

268
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,959
because they were at the time thousands

269
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
of people. They had just crossed a

270
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,200
billion users, so much bigger than than

271
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,519
us in terms of company size. But they

272
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
were really focused on preserving as

273
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,720
much of the startup culture as they

274
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
could. So for example, uh every 3 or 4

275
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
months they would do a whole company

276
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
hackathon where everybody would get to

277
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,600
focus on what they were interested in

278
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,800
for a couple days instead of the the

279
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
ordinary road map. They really prized

280
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,000
experimentation. They really tried to,

281
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,080
you know, famously had the move fast and

282
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
break things kind of slogan. So I think

283
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
it was good that we went to a company

284
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,320
that was bigger but not super big

285
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
company or slow. And it taught us that

286
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,880
you can grow your team and grow your

287
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,040
ambition but still focus on the things

288
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,959
that keep you moving fast. I think the

289
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,279
value of the team is something that will

290
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,360
stay with me forever because you know

291
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,519
you can have the right strategy and you

292
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,440
can have a good product ultimate the

293
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,519
details that go into those products the

294
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
the pace and speed that you're able to

295
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,120
execute on and like how much fun it is

296
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
which is also really important

297
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
ultimately comes down to having the

298
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
right team around you and that's a

299
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
mixture of people that are talented but

300
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
don't have a lot of ego which is a

301
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,040
interesting and difficult combination to

302
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,040
find sometimes people that are willing

303
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
to be generalist lists rather than just

304
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
be caught in their sort of individual

305
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,959
silo. And so, you know, at Instagram, we

306
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,320
had people who would start off, you

307
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
know, writing the back end for a

308
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
feature, but would also then build the

309
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
iOS or the Android part. And it's

310
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,360
important, I think, for you to have that

311
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
fluidity, especially on engineering or

312
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
designers that would code or product

313
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,279
managers that would design, and it's

314
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,800
just not getting everybody boxed in. So,

315
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,040
that aspect is really important. And

316
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,720
then also a team that really cares about

317
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,720
the product they're building, which

318
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,480
again is easily more easily said than

319
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,640
done. It's I've al I've seen companies

320
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
where everybody is working and they

321
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,839
could be working hard but they don't

322
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
have a passion or really an attachment

323
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,040
to the thing that they're working on.

324
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,040
You're never going to get great products

325
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
that way. It just never happens because

326
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
the great product breakthroughs come

327
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
from people being close to the details,

328
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,760
understanding what could be better,

329
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,440
coming up with the next idea themselves,

330
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,440
not waiting for a, you know, strategy

331
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,680
meeting. So that value kind of

332
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
throughout the right kind of people and

333
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
the right sort of setup of team is

334
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,640
something that I think about all the

335
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,640
time.

336
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,320
In 2021, I founded Artifact of the same

337
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,640
co-founders, Kevin. Our goal, our

338
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
observation was there's been a rise and

339
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,079
at the time it wasn't, you know, LLMs

340
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
yet, but there was a lot of rise in

341
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,079
machine learning and the beginning of

342
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,560
some of these neural networks. For all

343
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
of that interest and rise, there was

344
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,920
still not a lot of products being built

345
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,279
that felt very personal. Because if you

346
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,839
think about it, the promise of some of

347
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
this machine learning was great with a

348
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,120
lot of signals, we'll be able to

349
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
incorporate what's personal to you and

350
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
also what's aggregated out, you know,

351
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,000
among a broader group and be able to

352
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
tailor the experience. But you looked

353
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
around and there actually wasn't that

354
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,079
many personal experiences. So our bet

355
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,560
with the company was by combining

356
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,920
cutting edge machine learning and good

357
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
product design, we'd be able to build

358
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
products that felt very personal to you.

359
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
And we started with news uh and articles

360
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,279
in general because that was something

361
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
that we felt most people are readers

362
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,480
even if they're not like book readers.

363
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
They like reading articles online. And

364
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,240
there's an existing kind of ecosystem of

365
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,680
blogs and newsletters and news sites

366
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
that was out there that we if we could

367
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,200
just connect people to those sites be

368
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,519
able to deliver a good product. And the

369
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,279
idea behind the company was this is the

370
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,680
first product, but we'll kind of take

371
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,839
the same personalization technology and

372
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,160
be able to map it to other products that

373
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,920
are also at this intersection of

374
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
personalization and content. So we

375
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,440
thought about shopping recommendations,

376
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,360
we thought about local recommendations,

377
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,519
all these ideas around how to

378
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,519
personalize information using machine

379
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,519
learning.

380
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
We launched um the product after about 2

381
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
years in private beta which I think was

382
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
too long because it took us too long to

383
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,279
get out to the market to start learning

384
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
and it also meant that by the time we

385
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,880
launched the team was already quite

386
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
exhausted for having worked really

387
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,079
really hard on this product for 2 years

388
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
non-stop and then we let the product run

389
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,240
for about a year and after a year what

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
we noticed was the energy was not there

391
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,880
in the system. like we would work really

392
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
hard to like improve a feature or add

393
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,279
social features and comments and

394
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,600
re-shares or posts and user generated

395
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,800
content like we we were trying big ideas

396
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
like it wasn't like the product was

397
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
standing still and it was very hard to

398
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,880
shift the energy in the system and I

399
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,240
think that was because there was not a

400
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,160
fundamental fit around what we were

401
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
doing and what people were wanting and I

402
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
think there was probably two aspects of

403
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,320
that the first one was even if our

404
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
algorithms I think were very good the

405
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,399
mobile web kind of websites that we were

406
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,560
sending people to for this news. They

407
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,320
were often like full of ads or not

408
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
formatted very well or full of like

409
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,120
pop-up videos. It was just not a very

410
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,480
good experience once you actually

411
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,160
clicked through. And that was like I

412
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,160
think a hard experience to deliver. And

413
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,839
I think the second part was our product

414
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
got really good if you put enough data

415
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,279
in there and you read enough articles.

416
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,880
We'd get very personal to you at the

417
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,880
level of all right, Mike is interested

418
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,200
in Formula 1, but not just Formula 1. is

419
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,800
interested specifically in this driver

420
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,160
and also he likes Brazilian modernist

421
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,160
architecture but also when that's paired

422
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,320
with you know Scandinavian design like

423
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
that level of like really specific

424
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,519
knowledge but to get that you had to

425
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
read a lot of articles and so most

426
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,720
people would come in they would read a

427
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,720
couple of articles they would say this

428
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
isn't very different than Apple News and

429
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,600
then they would bounce off so I think we

430
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,040
bet too hard on personalization without

431
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
remembering that you also have to be

432
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,560
good at the very beginning before you've

433
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,199
really gotten a lot of personal content

434
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,760
I think one big lesson is that users are

435
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,680
not going to adopt a feature or a

436
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
product just because of the the

437
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,360
technology underneath or just because it

438
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,800
has intelligence. It actually has to

439
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
still solve the problem. It goes all the

440
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,920
way back to what I had learned at

441
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
Stanford. So as we build products at

442
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,040
Enthropic, of course, the models are

443
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,279
very intelligent and they can do a lot.

444
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,959
But you have to do more than just say

445
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,800
this model is so smart. You have to go

446
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,320
beyond that and say and here's what it

447
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,760
can do for you and here's how it can

448
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,279
connect to you and here's how it can be

449
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,800
useful to you even if you're just

450
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
getting started with it. Right? It goes

451
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
back to that feeling an artifact of yeah

452
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,920
the product is good if you put a lot of

453
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,560
work into it. Like we need to design

454
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,320
things with claude that are useful for

455
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,839
somebody that's just discovering LLM

456
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,360
kind of for the first time. So a lot of

457
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
the work that we're doing right now is

458
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
how do we lower the barrier for people

459
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
who aren't yet familiar with all the

460
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
ways that AI can help you in your daily

461
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
life to just give them some really

462
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,360
concrete things that they could do where

463
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,360
it's useful to them today rather than in

464
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,880
theory. So that's a big lesson lesson

465
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
learned. I think another one that's

466
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,560
important as well is how do you get user

467
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,800
intent and the personalization more

468
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,560
quickly? And so for us, it's, you know,

469
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,760
when when you sign up for Claude, we ask

470
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,519
you some questions. And it's nice

471
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,720
because, you know, you can actually chat

472
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,920
start chatting with Claude and get a

473
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,760
feeling of what it's like to talk to

474
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Claude. Um, and hopefully, you know, the

475
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,320
questions we ask in that onboarding

476
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
process in your first day let us be able

477
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,760
to be more tailored and personal to you

478
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,040
quickly. And that was kind of came out

479
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,240
directly from the Artifact

480
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,320
experience. That's a great question

481
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,800
around like when is it time to call it?

482
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
When does the chapter close? The way

483
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,120
that we did this with Artifact, um, and

484
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,199
I think this helped, was we sat down, me

485
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
and Kevin, we made a list of like what

486
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,000
are the ideas that we still have in this

487
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,160
space that we will feel really silly not

488
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
having tried before shutting it down.

489
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,320
And we wrote them down and then we

490
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,120
prioritized like three big ones that we

491
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,880
said, we want to try this and after we

492
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,639
try this, we'll take a step back and

493
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
say, did it change? Did it change the

494
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,560
the trajectory of the company? Um, and

495
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,079
we did that and then we kind of wrapped

496
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,560
up 2023 and enter 2024 and we said we

497
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,000
tried them. It's still not, you know,

498
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
it's still not changing the the

499
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
trajectory. Then, you know, it's time to

500
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,759
to move on. But it is quite tricky. I

501
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,839
think it's I've seen entrepreneurs get

502
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,600
stuck at companies for years that they

503
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,279
feel, you know, they owe it to

504
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,320
themselves or their investors to keep

505
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,519
going, but it's not likely to to shift

506
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
the directions. So I think being

507
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,600
concrete either with a date or with a

508
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,240
set of projects helps you um know when

509
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,160
to move on. I think one big piece of

510
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,360
advice is I think we're often as

511
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,839
entrepreneurs uh we we have a lot of

512
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,519
weight on our shoulders and you know

513
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,959
between Instagram and Artifact I did

514
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,720
some angel investment and it's never

515
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,199
positive news when an entrepreneur tells

516
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,360
you that a company doesn't work but I've

517
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,519
seen it before you know and so it's not

518
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
a surprise that some companies don't

519
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,919
work out. that's baked into the model.

520
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,839
And so I guess I the advice I'll give is

521
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,600
really check in with your investors and

522
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,360
don't I've seen entrepreneurs get stuck

523
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,079
in this idea like I have to keep going

524
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,280
because my investor expects me to. And I

525
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,799
think what they'll find is sometimes

526
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,360
investors are like you're trying you've

527
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,439
tried it all in this space. I think it's

528
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
time to to call it and that's okay. And

529
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
you know it's not it's never a

530
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,679
celebration but it doesn't have to be

531
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,679
you know a tragedy either.

532
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,240
[Music]

533
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,160
I think what was interesting with the

534
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
anthropic role is that it was both

535
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
joining an existing company the company

536
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,960
was about 3 years old at the time had

537
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,280
already launched models had cloud.ai and

538
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,799
AI but there was still a lot of zero to

539
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
one to be done so I don't think we had

540
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,720
our mobile apps yet um we hadn't built

541
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,039
things like claude code which is our

542
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,440
agentic coding tool so there was a lot

543
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,679
of empty space still in the product so

544
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,400
it was kind of a combination of 0ero to

545
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,039
one and established uh we have a claude

546
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
character um effort and team and that

547
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,200
team is really focused on what are

548
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,440
claude's philosophies what's cla's vibes

549
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,240
how should claude respond and that's

550
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,679
been uh an effort even from early days

551
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
but It's something we've focused even

552
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
more on recently in the rest of the AI

553
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,760
landscape. You can often have these

554
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,280
evaluations or evals right where you say

555
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,160
all right how is you know the model

556
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,559
doing at math or competition coding or

557
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,400
agent coding it's a challenge to say

558
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,400
what kind of vibes does the model have

559
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
we have some internal ways of doing that

560
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
often you can try to use claude to

561
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,720
listen to claude and then say you know

562
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,480
what kind of vibe does it have but it

563
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
also comes from just using claude a lot

564
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,039
internally so every day there are

565
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,799
hundreds of conversations that you know

566
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,400
people atanthropic are having with

567
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,160
claude with the intention of

568
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,559
understanding how is Claude's

569
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,480
personality evolving uh when we're doing

570
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,960
training how could it be different going

571
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,960
forward even things like should claude

572
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
be verbose like should it say a lot or

573
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,280
should it be concise and the answer

574
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,840
varies on the depending on the situation

575
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,960
I think one of the hardest ones is um we

576
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,600
are building a fundamentally a dynamic

577
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,280
model and a dynamic system and so as an

578
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,799
example you know we have in cloud.io

579
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Okay, we have a a feature called

580
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,840
artifacts where uh you can sort of work

581
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,760
on a document or even a website along

582
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,760
with claude. You know, the model learns

583
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,520
how to make artifacts, but the taste

584
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,919
that it has in artifacts and how it

585
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,679
changes and what language it uses and

586
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,760
exactly what it does evolves from model

587
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,679
to model. And sometimes you don't know

588
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,360
how it's evolved until very late in the

589
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,799
model training process. So, one of the

590
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,039
biggest challenges with building

591
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,039
products alongside doing model

592
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
development is they're both moving

593
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,640
targets. Our product is evolving, the

594
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
models are evolving. Often the models

595
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,320
are evolving up to like a week before

596
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,000
launch and we're trying to build

597
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,240
products alongside. It's a very

598
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,240
interesting dynamic system. It's what

599
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,080
makes it exciting because the model can

600
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,200
be creative and it can surprise you in a

601
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,440
lot of ways. Uh but it's also um a lot

602
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,600
more challenging than try classic

603
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,320
product development.

604
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,720
I think it's really important to as a

605
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,200
product development team to be really

606
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,280
upfront about the capabilities and the

607
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,799
limitations and the risks. So you'll see

608
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,120
when you sign up for cloud and you go

609
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,200
through the the first conversation, we

610
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,559
really emphasize here's what models are

611
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
good at and here's where they can still

612
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,440
make mistakes. Um and here's the

613
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,919
limitations. And I think it's important

614
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
to lead at the beginning because I want

615
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
people to have the right mental model

616
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,640
when using these models. They're not

617
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,640
perfect. They don't know everything. um

618
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,200
but they can be very helpful in for a

619
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
given task. Similarly, I think goes back

620
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,480
to the kind of that quad character

621
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,200
piece. It's important for the model to

622
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
also be aware of its limitations. And so

623
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,039
often you'll find if you ask cla about

624
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,559
medical questions, it might say, "All

625
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,799
right, I can tell you more about this,

626
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,159
but first I'm not a doctor." And if

627
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,520
you're worried about this, then you

628
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,520
might want to consult a professional.

629
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,960
And it's not just a thing we put in for

630
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
liability. It's a thing we put in

631
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,559
because we think it's really important

632
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,400
to have Claude recognize its own

633
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,679
limitations as much as

634
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,280
possible. Yeah. So it's an interesting

635
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,919
question for us which is how do we

636
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,320
gather user feedback on claude in a way

637
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,679
that is like most helpful and the way

638
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
we've currently found although I think

639
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,200
there are probably other ways that we

640
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,600
can continue to evolve it is for every

641
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,280
answer in in claude we have you know

642
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
thumbs up thumbs down how did we do for

643
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,480
both thumbs up and thumbs down you can

644
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,559
write a little paragraph about why it

645
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,880
was good or was it bad and it's so

646
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,760
interesting because um and that extra

647
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,360
bit of signal around why is the most

648
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,039
important part and so we have a product

649
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
manager and she's She spends a lot of

650
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,280
her time aggregating and evaluating and

651
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
looking at how the model is doing out in

652
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,880
the wild. And then you start seeing

653
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,159
themes. So an individual answer maybe

654
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,159
doesn't give you the clue about how you

655
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,760
need to improve the model. But then in

656
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,480
aggregate you say, okay, Claude is being

657
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,760
too too verbose here in this particular

658
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,760
case. We're going to change it for the

659
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,200
next model. Or Claude is changing its

660
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,440
mind too quickly. So when the user

661
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
disagrees with Claude, maybe the user is

662
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,440
actually looking for a debate. Sometimes

663
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,600
Claude is like, "It's fine. Like you're

664
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,280
right. I'm sorry I was wrong, but the

665
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,280
user was actually looking for more of a

666
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,600
back and forth. So that kind of

667
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,840
conversational feedback is incredibly

668
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,159
valuable. And we basically for every new

669
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,919
model training will first look at all

670
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
the feedback in aggregate for the

671
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,600
previous one and say what do we want to

672
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,960
keep the same and what do we want to

673
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,919
change or what do we want to double down

674
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,240
on and what do we want to make

675
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,159
different. So that feedback process is

676
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,080
very very important and it's actually

677
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,720
the main feedback we get. So we don't

678
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,520
train on any user data um including

679
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,760
conversations for anybody but we do use

680
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,159
the the thumbs up and thumbs down as a

681
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,120
really helpful signal to figure out what

682
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,120
we need to improve. I think there's two

683
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,520
areas of consolidation that I expect to

684
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,520
see. One is on the model development

685
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,919
side of things as these models they're

686
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,240
already very expensive to to build and

687
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
train at scale. as they reach even

688
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640
higher levels of intelligence they're

689
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,840
going to require that same kind of jump

690
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,400
in compute and resources and I think

691
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,320
we'll probably come down to three four

692
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,000
five companies doing that not as many

693
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
you're already seeing some kind of

694
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
consolidation and and in that side of

695
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,039
things I think anthropic is well

696
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
positioned there we've got really great

697
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,640
partnerships with Amazon with Google

698
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,039
that I think will unlock a lot of

699
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,000
compute for us and the other side is um

700
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,320
consolidation in more of the apps side

701
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,640
of things because I spoke at the Y

702
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,400
Combinator batch of startups recently

703
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,000
and everybody's working on something

704
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,080
that is AI or directly uh adjacent to AI

705
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,159
and that's great there's a lot of

706
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,760
products still to be built in this space

707
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,200
but not all of them are going to work so

708
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,280
in the same way as you saw that with

709
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,600
mobile and social media where it's

710
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,280
useful to have that explosion cuz no one

711
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,520
company is going to map the whole space

712
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
out then you start naturally seeing you

713
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,480
know what's getting traction what's

714
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,799
going to get consolidated what are good

715
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,360
idea what were good design ideas but

716
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,120
wrong sort of business ideas that then

717
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,039
will evolve into better business ideas.

718
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,360
That evolution I think is very healthy.

719
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,679
Uh I saw that process with mobile, I saw

720
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,520
it with social media. I think now is the

721
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,200
time to start seeing it. Well, maybe you

722
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
know in a 6 month time you'll start

723
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,960
seeing more of that within the app space

724
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,320
as

725
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,840
well. I think there's when I think about

726
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
where we are and where we need to get

727
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,880
to, there's a couple of avenues I think

728
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
are really important. The first one is

729
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,480
understanding people for more than just

730
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,200
a single conversation or even a couple

731
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,559
of conversations. So we're not static,

732
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
right? We are dynamic. We have

733
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,480
relationships. We have moods. We have

734
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,120
challenges. We have wins. And I think

735
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,960
for models to be feel really like they

736
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,720
can work alongside us to really be part

737
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,960
of our lives. They're going to need to

738
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,799
develop a sort of empathy beyond a

739
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,279
single conversation and really have that

740
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,480
sort of longer horizon interaction with

741
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,080
somebody. I think that's really

742
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,320
important. I think that comes from

743
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,720
contextual understanding and memory. For

744
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,799
example, the second part is the models

745
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,400
need to learn when they can be proactive

746
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,159
and when they should sit back. As

747
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,760
people, we often know if somebody's

748
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
head's down working, we're trying to

749
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,880
we're not going to go interrupt them or

750
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
if they come to you for help, we can

751
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
answer a question and maybe get back to

752
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,640
work ourselves. So, how do we have that

753
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,880
collaboration with models in a way that

754
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,039
feels really natural? As an example, we

755
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,200
have Claude as a participant in our

756
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,799
Slack channels, anthropic, which is

757
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,559
great. it can chime in and and be part

758
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,039
of the conversation, but we're finding

759
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,039
it still either will not participate

760
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,640
enough or say too much. So, how do we

761
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,480
get it to feel like a more natural

762
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
participant in these conversations is

763
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,720
important. And then the third one is

764
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,120
around agency and independence. So, how

765
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,960
do we get the models to be able to take

766
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,720
direction from people but then go off

767
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,880
and either do work or do research or be

768
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,960
waiting for additional input and do that

769
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
over a much longer time horizon in the

770
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
background. I think that's very

771
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
exciting. There's a lot of things that

772
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,679
will be enabled by that capability, but

773
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,000
it's going beyond the sort of chat box

774
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,080
with a single interaction to more of a

775
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,520
longunning agent in the background. One

776
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,320
of the big changes that's going to

777
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,640
happen is the models will start being

778
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,240
able to give you insights about your own

779
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,320
self, which I think is very powerful,

780
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,679
right? Um I I have worked with a coach

781
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,520
for many years. I think it's one of the

782
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,760
most important ways in which I improve

783
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
as a leader. I want that for everybody,

784
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,039
right? Everybody has can benefit from

785
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,880
reflection and learning and iterating on

786
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,039
the way that they you know approach the

787
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
world. Right now you can go to Claude

788
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
and tell it about how things are going

789
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,760
and it will probably be able to give you

790
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
some coaching but it's very point in

791
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,919
time. When I think about the potential

792
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,760
it's to be much more of an ongoing sort

793
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,559
of uh improver or you know

794
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
conversational um you know coach. I use

795
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,360
this right now with Claude a lot.

796
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Anything that I write, I will put, you

797
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,559
know, if I'm writing a strategy

798
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,080
document, I'll put it into cloud and

799
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,320
say, "What am I missing? What did I

800
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,080
forget? Like, what poke some holes in my

801
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,720
argument?" And it's great to have that

802
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,960
partner. Um, I think that'll be one big

803
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,679
evolutionary step. The other one that's,

804
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,600
this is more speculative, but if uh

805
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,000
models go from being single

806
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,159
conversations, you know, single chats to

807
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,559
being more of, you know, long horizon

808
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,000
almost personalities, I'm curious what

809
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,159
kind of relationship we'll form with the

810
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,039
models. is like will it feel more like a

811
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,039
friend uh in some ways or a co-orker in

812
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,200
some other ways? I think that remains to

813
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,200
be

814
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,320
seen. I think in your early 20s you have

815
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,159
a unique place in the world because

816
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,919
you've you're pretty in touch with the

817
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,120
trends that like teenagers have which is

818
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,760
important especially if you're building

819
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,600
in consumer but you're now able to like

820
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,679
take those insights and make them into

821
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,080
something like a project or maybe even a

822
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,679
company. So, it's a very special time in

823
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,679
your life where you're like at the

824
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,039
intersection of being a teenager, being

825
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,799
really tuned into that, but being able

826
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,320
to do those things. I'd say the two

827
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,880
things I would I would I would add is

828
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,960
one, not worrying so much that every

829
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,720
step needs to make logical sense.

830
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,960
There's definitely things that side

831
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
projects I did or explorations I did

832
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,840
where at the time I was like, am I

833
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,760
wasting my time here? But actually

834
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,440
later, I find that it was connected to

835
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,520
the next thing I did. So just trust that

836
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,840
if you're driving towards a direction,

837
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,120
it might take some very strange routes

838
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,399
to get there, but as long as you're

839
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,399
learning, I think that that's fine. And

840
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,039
then the second one is advice that I got

841
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,520
when I was 21 and I still think about to

842
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,520
this day is the companies change, the

843
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,080
projects change, you know, the economy

844
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,919
changes, but the relationships you build

845
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,440
in your career will be the relationships

846
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,120
that you have over and over again. And

847
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
so I was working at a startup as an

848
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,640
intern and it was full of people who

849
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,480
were in their late 30s who had worked

850
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,640
together probably three or four times

851
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,559
since they were 20 and it really stayed

852
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,640
with me. So like remembering that those

853
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,720
relationships build on each other and

854
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,720
recur which means that it's you know

855
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,039
it's worth investing in the in that

856
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,720
time. I think for me I was talking to to

857
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,120
Daniela who's one of the co-founders of

858
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Anthropic. I I told her and I meant it I

859
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,039
hope Anthropic is the last job that I

860
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,679
have. I think I see the opportunity here

861
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,080
to be paired with research and build

862
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,440
interesting products for many many years

863
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,039
because I think every year will be

864
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,559
different. When I was 18, I had this

865
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
like promise to myself that I wanted

866
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,440
every year to feel different. And this

867
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,640
year has felt very different than any

868
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,159
other year that I've had being an

869
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,520
anthropic. And I think that the year

870
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,799
ahead is going to be quite different as

871
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,559
well. And so that's how I really think

872
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,640
about the next 5 years is just making

873
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,799
sure I'm set up for consistently

874
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,399
learning, evolving, working with

875
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,640
interesting people on interesting

876
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,320
products. And then taking the space at

877
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,679
least once a year to step back and say,

878
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,600
am I still learning? Am I still, you

879
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
know, eventually at Instagram, you know,

880
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,640
8 years in, there was a time where I

881
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,760
said, okay, I think I've I've gotten

882
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
what I need to get out of this

883
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,279
experience, and now it's time to try

884
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,520
something else. To me, entrepreneurship

885
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,520
is about finding ways in which the world

886
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,440
could be different and better and in

887
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,360
feeling empowered to go make that

888
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,640
change. It's something that really drove

889
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,360
me from a pretty early age. And as I've

890
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,960
seen that manifest both in the ways you

891
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,880
can change your city, the way you can

892
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,559
change, you know, the way people relate,

893
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
of course, with Instagram having global

894
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,320
impact, large or small, it's really

895
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,000
about identifying like what could be

896
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
different like as getting curious about

897
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,240
the world and then also getting curious

898
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,640
about how you or you and a small team

899
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,120
can see if there's a a change to be made

900
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,520
there. Um, and I'm very excited about

901
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,799
the way AI will empower people to ask
