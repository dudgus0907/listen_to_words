1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
To be honest, like our first product

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,200
looks really rough. We actually only

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,679
used two weeks. One day we have over

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
like 100 people just flowing this

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
product. Our users actually just you

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
know like doubled. There is huge

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,480
increase in the user and there's huge

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
increase in the revenue. That is a time

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,600
we know okay we hit something right. We

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,439
have over 10 million downloads in a year

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,680
and we now have over 10 million

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,720
annualized revenue within a year. It's

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,320
not just about fantastic UI, UX or how

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,120
you're marketing it, right? It's more

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
like what result users are get. You

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,600
don't need to wait for the product to be

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,840
perfect to launch it. Most of the time

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,719
in the AI era, things will change every

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,960
day. If you wait too long, you may never

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
be able to launch your product. So, you

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,440
just need to launch it, develop it,

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,440
learn from it at the same

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,359
time. Hi, I'm Ella. I'm the founder and

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,760
the CEO of CRY AI. Criti is the agentic

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,720
AI to augment your marketing video at

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,880
scale. Just drop one product image and

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,520
Criti write your script, shoot your

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,159
video and even do the processing for

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
your marketing video without the need of

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,119
full media crew. Cringy is growing

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,840
pretty fast. We have over 10 million

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,000
downloads in a year and we now have over

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
10 million annualized revenue within a

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,600
year thanks to our network effect

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
between the influencer and the

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,320
[Music]

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,880
brands. I started my career as actually

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,400
a hardware engineer at Apple. We are

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,799
building the first generation of

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,159
AirPods. We don't even know what product

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,799
people actually need. So we invite a lot

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,600
of users to our small interview room and

43
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,920
we ask them a lot of questions like what

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,079
do you need actually for the earpods?

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,799
What do you actually have the pinpoints

46
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,560
for? Uh things like that. At Apple when

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
we conduct the interviews instead of

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,439
just doing online surveys we actually

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,119
more prefer to invite the users to the

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,360
interview room and conduct like

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,959
face-toface interviews. Right? When you

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
ask people to fill out the survey

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,520
online, people most of time they just,

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
you know, click the first one, whatever

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,319
they see there, right? Because they want

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
to just jump to the end. No one really

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,720
want to get their feedback. So you may

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,720
get the wrong answers. And another more

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,040
important thing actually is when you are

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,520
talk to your users face to face, you

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,160
actually get more than what you want to

62
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,959
ask, right? Like people they always have

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,920
some assumption that okay maybe user

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,000
need A b and C but actually user don't

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
care about them like at all right like

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,720
they only care about what they care

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,319
about like D but you don't have that on

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,560
your survey so you'll get the wrong

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
answer that's the reason actually Apple

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,480
prefer to have face-to-face user

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,720
interview when they are building a new

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,680
product and one important thing we learn

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,840
at Apple is you know you really need to

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,319
understand people's pain points you need

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,959
to really know why people need it when

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,000
you are building it. We have our like a

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,159
lot of fantastic ideas or imagination

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,480
but those are not solving the pain

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,280
points of real customers and that's not

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,280
we want right so meeting people or

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
knowing people's pain points actually is

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,680
the first step when you need to create a

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,640
great product. The AirPods project is

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,480
like it's amazing uh experience for me.

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,799
Many people said I should stay there for

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,440
longer. But the thing is that I always

87
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,760
pursue for building something new or

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,239
building something I think I feel most

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,120
excited for. When I was a child, I found

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,000
I get information much easier when I get

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
it in the form of video instead of like

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
long text or like blog post or things

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,400
like that. So it is always my dream that

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,360
in the childhood that if one day we

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,840
could turn a lot of communication the

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
learning the information gathering just

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
in the video format that will be really

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,799
helpful for a lot of people sometimes

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,120
you know it's it's pretty pretty hard

100
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,959
for people from the giant company to

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,360
actually quit and really doing the

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,000
startup when I looking back I really

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,639
miss the time there at big company

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,759
enjoying with my friends and my family

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,160
Still I think I don't regret uh because

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,040
I am doing what I really passionate

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,720
about and I believe that will help a lot

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
of people that is more important to

109
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,320
me when I saw the generative AI even

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,479
it's back in 2020 I believe that one is

111
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,280
will change the world and it will be the

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,080
future because at that time I saw a lot

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,080
of people they spend over 80% of their

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,000
time just online instead of offline,

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,840
right? So there is a huge trend that

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,479
people actually are shifting from

117
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,720
offline to online and then people will

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,080
definitely need much much higher demand

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,800
for the great content online. But on the

120
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,800
offset that I saw it's pretty pretty

121
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,440
hard for people to create great content

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,440
right the requirement for great content

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,560
actually growing higher and higher. The

124
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,560
supply of the great content actually uh

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,960
have a huge gap between the supply and

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,800
the demand. I'm pretty certain that you

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,280
know it's only the technology which

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,680
could like merge the gap and help people

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,479
with that. That's a time that I think

130
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,720
okay even though I am not experts I

131
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,759
don't know a lot about software or I

132
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,680
don't know a lot about AI but you know I

133
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,919
can always learn once I find the

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,639
motivation I would know what I want to

135
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,800
do and I can shift to that and I can

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,120
learn that pretty quickly to be honest

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,440
like our first product looks really

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,160
rough. We don't have really fantastic UX

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,000
or UI. We even don't have the batch mode

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
in the beginning. But that's totally

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,800
okay. You know, like sometimes when the

142
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,280
product is really rough, but users

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,199
still, you know, like willing to use it,

144
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,080
that means something. If you have a

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,240
really like bad design product, but

146
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,720
people are still using it. They're like,

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,120
okay, there's some real value thing in

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,520
that one. It's not just about fantastic

149
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
UI, UX, or how you're marketing it,

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,720
right? It's more like what result users

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,199
are get whether they can use it to get

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
the benefit they want. You don't need to

153
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
wait for the product to be perfect to

154
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
launch it because you know like most of

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,400
the time in the AI era like things will

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
change every day. If you wait too long

157
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,960
you may never be able to launch your

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,600
product. So you just need to launch it,

159
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,600
develop it, learn from it. At the same

160
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,560
time, there's one lesson I learned as a

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,479
founder or I will say the most painful

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
lesson I learned. Our first product

163
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,800
actually is called ZMO.ai. At the time I

164
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,720
was building Zmo. I'm not sure like why

165
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm building this like why people need

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,880
this. The thing is at the time me

167
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,680
journey is super hot. Everyone is

168
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,160
chasing that right. So just like so many

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
other founders, I'm like, "Okay, text to

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,960
image is so popular. We definitely need

171
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,960
to enter this domain. So let's do it."

172
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
But I don't really know why people are

173
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,360
generating those images. So I don't

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,440
really understand the users need. When I

175
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,599
was building the product, we actually

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
don't know what the business model will

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,160
be and we even don't know what the next

178
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,479
step will be, right? So the revenue

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,199
actually doesn't go that high as the

180
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,360
users grow, right? and we suddenly just

181
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,160
get lost right we don't know like why

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,240
people are using it like why some people

183
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,240
pay why some people don't pay for it

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,639
when we have this difficulty the only

185
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
thing I can think about is talking to

186
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,880
your customers right that is a thing I

187
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,280
learned from Apple we do email our users

188
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,879
or most active users email them like

189
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,360
over 500 and finally we get 300 actually

190
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,759
we have the face toface conversation

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,560
with them because I believe talk to the

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
users is the only way we can find

193
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
whether there is a true need or what do

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,800
they really need after talking to more

195
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,039
than like 300 users we find that a lot

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
of people they create the images it's

197
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,479
just out of curiosity the AI is so new

198
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,120
to them they just want to try it out but

199
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,680
they do a small group of people they

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,919
they actually do have the need for it

201
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,720
not designers they don't know how to

202
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,800
create all those cool images they do

203
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,200
need actually those content for

204
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,320
themselves for their company uh for

205
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,640
marketing. So we're like okay we finally

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,440
find people who have real needs for

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,599
that. Most of them who are on Amazon or

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,760
eBay or Etsy they actually use their

209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,800
phone directly to take the photos of

210
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,040
their product. So they hope that okay

211
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,680
the social media is also on the phone

212
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,920
photos and the videos are also on the

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,680
phone. it will make him much more sense

214
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
if you just build the product on the

215
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
model. After talking to them, we finally

216
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,399
made the decision. Okay, we will

217
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,320
reposition this product and we will

218
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,399
build it for people who really have the

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,959
needs which is marketing and we will

220
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,720
also shift it actually from the PC side

221
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,360
to mobile. That's the time when the

222
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,360
pivot is happening.

223
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,760
We are building the mobile version of

224
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,080
creati in a way that it's not actually

225
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,240
just a tool but it's more like a

226
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,440
community for both influencers and the

227
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,959
brands. The reason actually we have

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
features or templates for both

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,399
influencers and brands is actually we

230
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,360
find if some brands they want to do

231
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,920
marketing it's impossible actually to

232
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,399
avoid uh the influencers contribution

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,120
because influencers they are the people

234
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,519
who actually know best about the social

235
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,480
media who actually know much better

236
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,519
about what content is more engaging and

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,399
more attractive to users. So when we are

238
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,200
building creat from day one we know okay

239
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,080
we need to create the actually the

240
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,480
network effect between the influencers

241
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,800
and the brands they they know the

242
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,880
internet so well after they create the

243
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,279
template they will also will post those

244
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,920
videos uh on their own channel on the

245
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,720
social media and if that video templates

246
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,800
actually is a great one that video will

247
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,040
actually go viral it will actually get

248
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,079
millions or tens of millions of views

249
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,480
right and Those viral videos actually is

250
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,720
the best marketing strategy for us to

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
acquire more and more brands because

252
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,040
when the video go viral that will bring

253
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,240
a lot of lot of users to the

254
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,240
createl the end of funnel there will be

255
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,320
the brands that will really use this

256
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
video templates to create their engaging

257
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
ads video. So the brands actually when

258
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,800
they are using those brands as video

259
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,640
they will pay more uh to create this

260
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
platform so that we can hire more

261
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,640
influencers in the community and the

262
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,360
influencer can create more viral video

263
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,760
templates for the brands. So it's

264
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,000
actually a very nice flywheel actually

265
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,720
we're building between the influencers

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,360
and the brands and we believe that is

267
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,680
the key differentiation CR is have

268
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,880
compared to all other like AI marketing

269
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,800
tools is because we believe the

270
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,519
ecosystem actually need both sides. We

271
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,040
need both influencers and brands to help

272
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,040
them to grow marketing at scale.

273
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,640
The AI world just changed daily. Every

274
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
day you wake up, there will be new

275
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,720
technology and new product, right? And I

276
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,120
think building in the AI era is quite

277
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,440
different from like 20 to 30 years ago

278
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,040
when people are just enter the mobile

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,959
boom. The thing is actually I believe

280
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,440
maybe 99% or maybe all the products that

281
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,480
you saw today maybe not the final

282
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,959
version of what they will be at the end

283
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,760
of AI evolution. The requirement for the

284
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,079
founder in the AI era for AI startup

285
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,480
actually is kind of different from

286
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,440
previously because those founders really

287
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,560
need to adapt really quickly and

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,680
flexibility to those changes. And one

289
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,560
thing we think actually is helping us to

290
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,720
adapt to all those changes is we talk to

291
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,279
our users every day and to learn what is

292
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,920
the key thing that won't change even if

293
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,480
the technology change. So the thing that

294
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,680
we find out you know is what kind of

295
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,079
content will go pretty like viral on the

296
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,800
social media is all the things that our

297
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,639
users or our customers care about. Even

298
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,040
though technologies change, the

299
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,639
important thing is once you get those

300
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,639
industry insider data and knowledge uh

301
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,279
for that vertical that will build your

302
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,760
mode and that will actually be your key

303
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,160
value along with those all technology

304
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,399
changes daily or those technology change

305
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,000
will just help you instead of you know

306
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,000
like disrupted to your product.
