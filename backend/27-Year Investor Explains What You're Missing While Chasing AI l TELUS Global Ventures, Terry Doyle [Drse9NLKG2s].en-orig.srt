1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
But I've been investing and working in

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,640
technology companies since 1999. I've

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,760
seen a bunch of technologies come and

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
go. I saw the first crash. I was working

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,120
in the mobile phone industry when all of

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
a sudden the world discovered mobile

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
phones. What I think that does is it

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
changes the lens under which you look at

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,800
new technologies and new developments.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
When I was investing in 2022, I was not

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
investing in what everybody else was

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,160
investing in because I felt like we were

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
going straight up the hype curve. You

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
want to invest when nobody else is

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,719
investing. And if everybody's investing

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,920
in the same thing, you probably

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
shouldn't be in there. You should

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,040
wait. Hi, my name is Terry Doyle. I'm

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
the managing partner of Telus Global

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Ventures. We're the corporate venturing

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
arm of Telus, which is a Canadian

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,079
headquartered global technology and

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,399
services business. So, we have about 90

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
companies in our portfolio. 60% of them

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,199
have a commercial deal with Telus. Last

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,960
year we did about $34 million of

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,960
business with our portfolio

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,200
companies. Age is not a determination of

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,920
intelligence. And in fact, some of the

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,640
best founders I meet are great because

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,960
they don't have preformed ideas.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,119
Sometimes you meet people and they've

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,040
got lots of experience and because of

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,520
that experience something that hasn't

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
worked they sort of shut their minds off

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
that doesn't work I can't do this I

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,400
can't solve this problem this way

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
whereas I think sometimes people who

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,720
maybe don't have that experience they

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,240
bring a very new perspective to solving

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,880
a problem and say they don't make

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,600
assumptions if you talk to people in in

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,759
great companies like uh Google they

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
spend a lot of time trying to prevent

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,360
people from making those assumptions

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
Your response to this question is X. Do

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,320
you realize that there's two assumptions

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,240
that are part of that? Why have you made

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,479
those assumptions? Oh, that's always how

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,799
it's always been. Removing that bias

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,399
almost is where you get some real

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
breakthroughs. We've invested in

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,680
companies like Clinia, which has really

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,680
developed an AIdriven optimized search

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,959
for enterprise customers and that helps

56
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,560
providers give better outcomes to

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,040
patients. We knew we had a lot of data,

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,440
but again, data is only as good as how

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
it's presented, how it's accessed.

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,920
Lineia has really changed the way we

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,319
think about what we can do with that

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,400
data and that business. It's changed how

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
our customers think about their own

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,720
data, but also how they they run their

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
businesses. Creating that shift in the

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,599
way we think and how our customers think

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,360
was really one of the important outcomes

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,360
that we got in making that investment.

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,160
But I've been investing and working in

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,080
technology companies since 1999. I've

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,080
seen a bunch of technologies come and

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,080
go. I saw the first dot crash when web

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
van got hundreds of millions of dollars

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,280
investment and then went bankrupt. You

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
know, I was working in the mobile phone

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
industry when all of a sudden the world

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,319
discovered mobile phones. What I think

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,959
that does is it changes the lens under

79
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,840
which you look at new technologies and

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,360
new developments.

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,159
2014 I was spending time with a whole

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,159
bunch of some of the best people in the

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,840
world in artificial intelligence. This

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,800
is great. You know, it's going to be a

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,000
good development. Maybe I won't be as

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,760
excited about the changes in the

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,599
marketplace as if I'd never seen those

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,879
previous cycles. It means that when I

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,319
was investing in 2022, I was not

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,640
investing in what everybody else was

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,640
investing in because I felt like we were

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
going straight up the hype curve. You

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,080
want to invest when nobody else is

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,680
investing. And if everybody's investing

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
in the same thing, you probably

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,640
shouldn't be in there. You should wait.

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,879
When a good investor is able to see a

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
fundamental shift in society, you know,

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,360
the consulting firm McKenzie has a

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,519
language which is horizon 1, horizon 2,

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
horizon 3. Horizon 1 is something that

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
we can use now. It's getting to the

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,879
beginning parts of the use of its life

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,200
in as a technology. Horizon 3 is well

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,480
into the future, very far away from

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,959
being commercialized. More like

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,759
fundamental science. We will sometimes

108
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,079
want to make an investment in a Horizon

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,720
3 company and the business just doesn't

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,639
see the opportunity for it. The area of

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
quantum security is a good example of

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
this. We know that at some point in the

113
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
future quantum will change how people

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
can they will create tools where people

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
can do harm just as we start to see in

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,800
AI. We've done some investing in quantum

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
security and we're not quite at that

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
point where we can use it. We have to

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,639
make a an educated guess. Okay, we think

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
this is going to be problem in the

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,680
future. So we we should probably invest

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
early and learn get we'll call it

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,080
tuition value about how this particular

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,800
space is evolving and as a result we'll

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
wait five or 6 years before we have any

126
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,520
commercial deal with the company. Being

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,280
able to spot the large shifts make you

128
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,360
better able to invest in the right

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,960
things. I think if you jump at every new

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
development I think you're probably

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
going to have a hard time. You're

132
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,560
probably going to make a lot of

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,479
mistakes.

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,320
You know, I talk to my team all the time

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
about this idea that we will make

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
mistakes. As soon as you say that, that

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,600
changes the way people do things because

138
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,320
they don't freeze up. They're not

139
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,759
nervous about making a mistake. So, one,

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
we're going to make mistakes. Most

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,919
important thing is acknowledge that

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,919
you've made a mistake. Second is fix the

143
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,120
mistake as best you can. And third is

144
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,880
obviously the most important thing.

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
Don't make the same mistake twice. I

146
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
think if you create that environment for

147
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,039
people, they feel more comfortable. They

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
explore options more. they don't freeze

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,720
up and be conservative in how they

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,759
think. And I think that's that's really

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,919
our job. Our job is to take risk on

152
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
behalf of the company and do that in a

153
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,880
way which is sensible, but to push the

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,199
company and to help get more technology

155
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,680
into the hands of our customers to make

156
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
their lives

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,800
better. You'll hear many investors talk

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
about are you investing in the

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
individual or are you investing in the

160
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
idea or the market. I think the

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,880
individual is really the most

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,440
determinative factor. Somebody's ability

163
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,759
to solve problems and continue to work

164
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,680
at problems even when they're not making

165
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,280
headway is the sign of a good

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
entrepreneur. There's a level of

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,479
stubbornness there which really is

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,479
important in taking on big problems.

169
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,960
That problem solving mentality and that

170
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,120
ability to continue to work even though

171
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,199
there's no progress. I think that's one

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,919
of the things that makes good founders.

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,199
And so our job is to really find great

174
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,240
founders who are solving significant

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,319
problems. And if you find those people,

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
generally you can usually find people

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,759
who want to give them money to solve

178
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,720
those problems. That's really what

179
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,199
you're doing as an investor. You're

180
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,639
finding money and you're finding smart

181
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,880
people and you're bringing them

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,440
together. Being a founder is a really

183
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,360
hard job. It's an exceptionally hard job

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,319
and you have to have that ability to

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,800
wake up every day and want to take on

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,280
and solve a difficult problem. And so I

187
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,520
think the thing that I find rewarding is

188
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,520
every time I work with a founder and I'm

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
able to help them go that little bit

190
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,400
farther on their journey, that's

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,400
rewarding for me.
