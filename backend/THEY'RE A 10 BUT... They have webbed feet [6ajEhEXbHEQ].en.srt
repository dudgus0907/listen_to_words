cook any

216
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,000

something there are 10 nah seven stop

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,599

219
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,320
feel like burning it is so extreme like

220
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,159
if you're going to burn it every time

221
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,040
just take it out a little sooner you're

222
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,240
are used to burning everything the

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
second I burn something I'm never

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
burning it again promise to swear to God

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,200
put it on my life okay literally sugar

226
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
cookies I cook them they burn not

227
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,920
happening again with those sugar cookies

228
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,440
no way I think the thing that's making

229
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,079
them not a 10 here isn't the fact that

230
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,839
they're burning everything I think it's

231
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,920
the the fact that they just keep trying

232
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,240
to cook if you can't no just give up no

233
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,120
never give up never give up I was going

234
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,640
to say that at least they're trying I

235
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160

460
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
like I said Weaponry they're rude to

461
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
service staff biggest thing rude to

462
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,080
service staff zero go up to your mother

463
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,039
look her down in the eyes and say I hate

464
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,919
you Mom that's the equivalent that's the

465
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,960
equivalent I agree I don't know about no

466
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,440
I agree with it is that was that was

467
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,400
very well said at least your mom isn't

468
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,240
getting paid I respect that a lot

469
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,799
actually okay last one I have you should

470
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,320
treat you should treat your they're

471
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,679
working hard to should Tre staff the

472
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,440
same way that you would treat your my

473
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,679
thought is if once again you can't

474
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,159
afford if you can't afford to be kind

475
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,440
you already have the leverage customer

476
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,640
is always right which I don't think is

477
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,919
true it's not definely however you

478
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,559
already are winning 90% of the battles

479
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,480
cuz the customer's always right which is

480
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,919
baloney but just treat him with some

481
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,799
respect I agree no I who they say um

482
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,200
what's it called if if you can't afford

483
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,679
to be kind to the person helping you and

484
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,679
you also can't afford to tip don't go

485
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,520
out to eat order it to go you useless

486
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,400
[ __ ] like I get I get it server some

487
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,600
servers start start [ __ ] and like this

488
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,200
and that but I always feel like this is

489
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
like a big thing actually I always feel

490
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,760
like people get wrong at people for the

491
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
wrong things like people start cussing

492
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,240
out servers because it's something like

493
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,039
the chef messed up on it's like first of

494
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,640
all you're screaming at the wrong person

495
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,480
second of all even if mess up you're the

496
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,960
one with the [ __ ] complicated order

497
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,400
so if he didn't get it out every time

498
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,919
you go be idiot it's just a big game of

499
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,520
telephone

500
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,600
mhm they wash their body with dish soap

501
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,159
