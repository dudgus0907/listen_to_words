with parents we don't live with anyone

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,039
else so our number one question whenever

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,680
we're talking to someone is literally

48
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,039
actually and I don't know why I say

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,799
number one question but it dead ass is

50
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,399
is like oh do you guys cook like what do

51
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,959

52
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,399
everyone asks us and we tell them we

53
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,680
live just the three of us and the answer

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,720
is always we order pretty much every

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,480
single [ __ ] yeah we eat like [ __ ]

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,920
literal slob Piggies like Monsters no I

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760

we're about we're about to cook

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,239
something like equally kind of unhealthy

60
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,920
no it doesn't matter as long as it's

61
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,519
like it's also not about health cuz we

62
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920

295
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,560
many questions Nick I like a k of

296
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,959
questions you know that some

297
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,880
um do you think that pepperoni would

298
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:11,079
taste good if I [ __ ] what do you

299
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,760
think the hardest part of being a gay

300
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,279
person is not to get like deep and

301
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,720
emotional I'm just genuinely curious

302
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,560
like what do you think the hardest thing

303
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,000
about simply just coming to terms with

304
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,920
that oh wow so just like being okay that

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,800
you're a gay person is the hardest thing

306
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,440
a gay person can deal with I think it's

307
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,480
like the most challenging step and then

308
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
everything from there is just like you

309
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,240
it's barbecue chicken from

310
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,160
there it's barbecue chicken from there

311
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,560
yeah no the hardest part is definitely

312
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,320
coming to terms with and the rest of it

313
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,920
is just challenges that a normal

314
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,839

362
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:02,040
me so hot not to get crazy

363
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,639
but like oh God if I was at like a

364
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,040
restaurant on the 4th of July after a

365
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,040
baseball game and I go and I ordered

366
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,320
Caesar salad in Pepperoni Pockets and I

367
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,480
got this in a Caesar salad like and a

368
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
and a coke that's a good knif I feel

369
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,279
like this is like I always say Coke cuz

370
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,720
that's more pizza parlor Vibes that's

371
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,000
the only time I will take Coke over

372
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,480
Pepsi this is like this is like this

373
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519

374
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,240
