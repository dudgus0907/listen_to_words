00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,880
Next up, an original way for kids to

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,880
express

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,259
[Music]

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,400
themselves. Hi, Sharks. My name is

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,000
Jennifer Stein Bishoff and I'm from

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Brooklyn, New York. I'm seeking

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,199
$250,000 in exchange for 10% equity of

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,359
my company, Supermix Studio. Sharks. As

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,119
a mom, I've witnessed the self-esteem

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,920
boost that kids get when they pick out

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,680
their own outfit. As a designer, I

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
wondered how I could enable kids to

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,640
create something that's a true

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,800
reflection of who they are. Introducing

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,039
Supermix Studio, the world's first

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,680
interactive custom kids clothing brand.

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,920
Our innovative platform empowers kids to

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,199
celebrate their individuality by

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,000
designing their own clothes. If a video

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,840
game and a clothing brand had a baby, it

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
would be Supermix Studio. Users can

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,559
hyperpersonalize our clothing and

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,000
accessories and create something that's

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,760
100% original. Just like Jake, who loves

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,360
soccer and skating, nice, and Jasmine

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,759
who loves tennis and dance.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,799
But Supermix is really all about the

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,640
design experience. Let me show you.

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
First, visit our website and choose a

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,439
style. We have sweats, denim jackets,

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
backpacks, and accessories, all made of

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,560
sustainable materials. Then click

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,200
customize now. Our design platform opens

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
up and you'll find over 500 premium

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,000
patches to choose from. Just drag and

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,200
drop and place them anywhere you want on

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,720
the style, the front, back, sleeves, and

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,640
even the hood. Step three is our job. In

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,759
our studio, we bring your child's

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,079
masterpiece to life. As you can see, May

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,759
is wearing the final product, just like

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,240
the one designed on screen. Nice. Nice.

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,719
And the best part, your kid won't want

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,320
to take Supermix off because they're

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,239
proud of it. That's the Supermix magic.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
Sharks, who wants to join me in

47
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,920
empowering kids to express themselves by

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,720
literally wearing their hearts on their

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:21,040
sleeves? Ready, set, patch.

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Good job, guys. Good job, guys. Thank

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,120
you guys. You're amazing. Thank you.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
Good job, guys. Thank you, guys.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,879
Excellent. Excellent.

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
Sharks, in front of you, you'll find

55
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,879
Super Mix that I took the liberty of

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,959
designing for you. Oh my goodness. Look

57
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,519
at this.

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,239
Of course. All right, I'm in. It's

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,000
really cute. Sniffle. Robert, you have

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,920
our classic denim jacket. And what

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
you're seeing there are our superized

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,879
patches. As I mentioned, we have over

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
500 patches and we have over 30 of these

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,519
large superized patches, which is really

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,640
what everybody gets super excited about.

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,760
It's really a cute idea. Very cute. This

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,480
is really well made. It is thick. This

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,319
is a jean jacket, but it's soft. Yes.

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,319
And how much is it? What would this jean

70
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,840
jacket cost? Sure. So, that jean jacket

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,879
is $69. That's the base price. We're

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,519
seeing an additional 15

73
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:19,519
to20 upsell in all of the patches per

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,319
design. It comes that's an amazingly

75
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
good price. It is an amazing price. What

76
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,519
does it cost you to make? So that denim

77
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,680
jacket is $1375 and as I mentioned it

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
retails for 69. So the margins on denim

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
are in the high7s. What about in the

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,080
sweatshirts? The sweatshirt. So Damon,

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,599
the sweatshirt that you have there is

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,440
705 and retails for 55. It appears that

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,840
you're actually manufacturing the

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,400
patches yourself. All of them. All of

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
the patches are 100% proprietary

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,239
artwork. I'm a designer. I've been in

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,239
the industry for two decades. I'm

88
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
responsible for generating billions of

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
dollars in What companies were you with?

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,360
Well, my first big job was for Gloria

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,000
Vanderbilt. I was hired to launch their

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,799
first ever junior brand. I would create

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,200
a gene there that ultimately was written

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,439
up as the hundred million dollar fit.

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,879
Tommy Hilfiger saw that article and the

96
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,920
next thing I knew I was sitting in his

97
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,079
office and at 28 he hired me to be the

98
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,759
vice president of design for Tommy Jeans

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,759
to breathe some new energy into the

100
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
brand. Wow. Jennifer, you're a real

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,840
loser. Yeah. So, you have no experience

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,479
going at all. My last role was as chief

103
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,960
merchandising officer for a large scale

104
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,400
private children's wear manufacturer. It

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
took my entire career to finally figure

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,759
out that kids is what I love doing the

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,919
most. This is definitely the most fun

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
I've had in in my whole career. What

109
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,400
inspired you to say enough of the

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
corporate world? It was the pandemic and

111
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
my kids were home and I was just looking

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
for things to keep them busy. We started

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
tie dying and putting patches on things.

114
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,479
I was like, "This is so much fun. This

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
is the white space idea that I'm keeping

116
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
for myself. I love this." So, you're

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
rolling out kiosks. Where would the

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
kiosk be going? So, we're looking at

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
taking these kiosks to all kinds of

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,040
physical locations. The first people

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,039
that we're testing the kiosk with is

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,680
actually with Claire's. They're the

123
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,680
premier destination of all things tween.

124
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
Smart, but we're also looking at putting

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,120
them in kids clubs at resorts and on

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,680
cruise ships and of course department

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,080
stores and boutiques. Okay. So, when you

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,720
came in, I thought that this was you do

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,160
this online, direct to consumer. I go to

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
your website. That's correct. Yeah, me

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
too. Is this now an expansion? Yes. But

132
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,039
Jennifer, why? Well, because I'm a trend

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,560
forecaster and that's how I've been

134
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,560
successful in my career by doing things

135
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,680
that haven't been done before. And this

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,520
is an incredible instore experience.

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,039
Everything's about retail tamement. What

138
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,560
are your sales? I launched in October of

139
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,680
22. My first holiday season was $60,000.

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,320
Okay. And year to date, we've done 110.

141
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
So, it's 170 lifetime sales. You're not

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
making any money yet, are you? Not yet.

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,320
You're not selling the kiosk at all.

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,039
You're putting them in stores, right?

145
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,919
It's a very interesting relationship

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,680
with our retail and venue partners. I

147
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:14,080
hate this kiosk idea. Take your retail

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,720
shackles off. Set yourself free. I am be

149
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,440
reborn. I am reborn and I'm very happy

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
to go into this from a DTC perspective,

151
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,000
but we all know that customer

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,280
acquisition costs are very expensive and

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,080
they're rising and they're getting more

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,080
and more difficult. This is customer

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,880
acquisition. Yeah, but it's not. This is

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
It's not. And here's why. Because we've

157
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,199
gotten to the point now with direct to

158
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,680
consumer where there's online and

159
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,759
there's instore. And typically when you

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,560
make the decision to go in store, it's

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,120
the immediiacy of the product, right? I

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
can grab it and get it right there. That

163
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
doesn't happen with your kiosk. I think

164
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
you're going to have people walk up to

165
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,479
it and maybe put in some information

166
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
which is great for customer acquisition

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
and then expect it to pop out and you're

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,039
going to get a lot of canceled cards

169
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,599
because that product isn't right there.

170
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,440
So, for those reasons, I'm out.

171
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,599
Damon, what are you doing? I'm

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
struggling. I I like I like this thing a

173
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,520
lot. You know, this kiosk thing can

174
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,319
either be a massive hit or a real

175
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,360
problem. It's just too risky for me. So,

176
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm out. Jennifer, incredible quality,

177
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,720
great price point. The sales are so low

178
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,599
and now we're going into

179
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,440
kiosks, but I still love

180
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,960
it. I I hear your feedback about the

181
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
kiosk, and it's certainly giving me a

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,680
lot to think about. The people in the

183
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,080
space that I've shown it to have been

184
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,919
very, very excited about it. It's an

185
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,639
incredible instore experience, keeping

186
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,479
people in the store longer. Why do you

187
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,039
pay the retailer? And the arrangement

188
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,919
here as we're discussing going into

189
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,840
Claire's is that they will receive 30%

190
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,400
of the revenue driven from the machine.

191
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
That's fine. It's a win-win. Ultimately,

192
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,759
I'm holding the inventory and

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,240
fulfilling. So, all they have to do is

194
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,280
put this kiosk in their store and then

195
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,000
it's it's 100% incremental volume. I'm

196
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,919
telling you, this is the next massive

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
children's brand. Imagine it as the

198
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,639
Build-A-Bear of apparel. Let me take a

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,560
stab at it. Okay. You're very impressive

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,479
and I really believe in the demand and

201
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
it all came to you during CO 19. But

202
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,919
before CO 19, you got a different virus.

203
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,680
It's called retail 19 and it's it's

204
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
running through your veins even now. You

205
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,720
can't let it go. It's 30 to 40% of your

206
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,199
margin forever. It's a curse. But she's

207
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,000
selling online. She's about to do

208
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,919
retail, which I hate. I'm sorry. I'm

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,039
out. And and don't come too close to me

210
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,719
with that retail 19. I mean, that's just

211
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
me.

212
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,159
Listen, I actually think you're pretty

213
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,839
brilliant. Thank you. I think that you

214
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
think out of the box. You're an

215
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
innovator. You've done something

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
completely unique and different. And I

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,680
think it's super smart. I see this for

218
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,600
Disney. I see this as in places where

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
you have the mom and the kid. They're a

220
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,240
captive audience, right? It's empowering

221
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,000
and it feels empowering to me. All

222
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,760
right. So, okay. We're going to make you

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,680
an offer. I don't know. We're going to

224
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,839
figure it out. I mean, honestly, I've

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
never done a kids clothing line. Oh,

226
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,680
we're going to do a kids clothing line.

227
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,920
So, at this point, yeah, while you're on

228
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,040
to a great thing, it's still pretty

229
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,279
early. We're going to offer you

230
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,360
250,000. We want 25%.

231
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,440
We'd also like a royalty because we

232
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,240
think a cash flow of 5%. Until we make

233
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,040
back the initial 250,000. After that, it

234
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,720
goes away. 5%. And then it goes away.

235
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
What a bad deal. Well, you can

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
negotiate. I mean, Mark, you're not

237
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,080
putting up any money. Mark is not in

238
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,240
this deal. I do not find that a bad deal

239
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
in today's market. Capital is completely

240
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,560
dried up, particularly in your space.

241
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
The fact you have an offer goes to your

242
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:58,200
credibility in your past. Even though

243
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,200
you are infected with retail 19,

244
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,880
obviously, it's really important for me

245
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,440
to remain liquid and to be able to grow

246
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,920
this company. So, I'd like to counter at

247
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,480
20%

248
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,480
and 2% royalty.

249
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,959
I'm sorry. I just can't.

250
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,600
All right, Jennifer.

251
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:26,240
250,000, 20% equity, 3.5% royalty.

252
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,079
Lori, I'm good with that. Are you? The

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,720
royalty goes away after you're paid

254
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,720
back. Correct.

255
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,120
You have a deal. Amazing.

256
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,519
Thank you so much, Lori.

257
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,920
Congrats. Well done. Great presentation.

258
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,920
Thank you so much.
