13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
Chris just bonded with fortnite in a

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,559
severe level so all throughout high

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640

16
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,280

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,920

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,320
playing fortnite this is what the map

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,000
looks like over time without all the

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,000
years fortnite was trying something new

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,160
and they did a bunch of different

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,960
updates across the screen right now well

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,399
They're bringing back the map with some

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,840
of the updates from the old game

32
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,479
basically fortnite is 100 people in a

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,960
Lobby and you guys all have to work

34
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,960
together to be the last one standing

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,680
okay you're fighting everybody else and

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,560
you're using material that you find on

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
the map to build so that you can survive

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
achieve and win basically me maners are

39
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,280
going to take turns every single time

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560

super fast-paced game so there's going

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,360

46
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,920
really scary to transition from triplet

47
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,000

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,680
