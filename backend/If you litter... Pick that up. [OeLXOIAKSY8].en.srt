and spicy confused you're an idiot no

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not it's yep you're probably the

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,040
only [ __ ] ever not true

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,240
yesterday when we were doing the

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,759
In-N-Out thing the In-N-Out thing I

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
almost called the pepper sour you're a

41
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,600
[ __ ] idiot yeah that's real that's a

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,920
common mistake I make I was you're wrong

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,520
no it's not it's like just like one of

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,159
those things that's like oh they're both

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
describing things they're both it's

46
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,240
completely different sour and spicy are

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,159
EX on like full opposite yes but they're

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,840
both describing food words thank you so

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,920
punch punch and kick are both different

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,399
way not true not true that's basically

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
what he's doing say

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,280
yeah but you can mix those up because

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,159
they mean the same thing spicy and sour

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,479
they don't no they don't punch and kick

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,319
don't mean the same oh I I I don't know

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,480
why I thought you didn't say punch what'

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,879
you think he said I thought I was

58
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,120
thinking of fruit punch I think oh my

59
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,319
God oh my God I don't even know if what

60
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,519
just occurred made sense I don't think

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
it well now that I look back on it it

62
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,920
makes zero sense but when when it when I

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,879
was in the moment of what I was saying

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,160
it made perfect sense another thing I

65
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:33,360
wrote down if you litter pick that up

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,640
what are you doing throwing your trash

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,680
onto the the ground the highway the like

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,280
if you litter or like if you leave trash

69
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,800
out pick that up for me what the [ __ ]

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,560
are you doing dirtying the Earth you

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,920
chum no I'm not even like that I'm not

72
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,800
even like at trying to save the Earth

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,599
folk I'm just think well no I am I

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,280
didn't ask I didn't ask I'm just saying

75
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,159
more along the lines of like you have

76
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,440
trash how do you feel things that are

77
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,800
biodegradable big fan love that love it

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,720
are you cool if somebody litters that

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,040
though oh like an orange peel sure go

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,599
for it well that's good for the Earth

81
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,440
actually that's compost you're compost

82
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,799
if I'm with someone and I just met them

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,360
and they litter and they throw their

84
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,879
trash on the ground there's I I I want

85
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,879
to leave you faster than I've done

86
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,200
anything ever I want get away from you's

87
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,200
the most what's the most that you would

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,280
litter like on a bad day like if you had

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
to litter if I had to litter something

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,239
it would be like a a a thing that has

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,360
some stupid [ __ ] watch it's not stupid

92
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,319
at all go ahead you're just you think

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,560
what I think you're the type of guy

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,519
would be like if I were to litter

95
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,640
something I'd do 100 lb ice because the

96
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,200
ice will melt into the water and then

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,959
the water will help the Earth like

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,519
you're just like always on some dumb

99
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,680
[ __ ] thanks I'm always on some dumb [ __ ]

100
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,239
you are if I had finish your thought

101
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,720
this is the Box mat I think right here

102
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,959
slightly outside the box answer this

103
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
question I would say if I had to litter

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,360
something it would probably be like a

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,319
bottle cap if I like dropped it I might

106
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,680
not pick it up nope if I had to litter

107
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,799
something it would be a um it would be

108
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,640
like a a water bottle or something with

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
liquid inside if you can't find the cap

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
cuz then it could has spill potential

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,079
like if I'm going to LIT or something

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,239
it's cuz it has like spill potential or

113
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,200
ice cream like a like a like a ice cream

114
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,120
I just jumped ahead to the next sentence

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,400
I forgot to finish the first one even

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,040
like I would never get rid of like a

117
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,320
paper bag full of junk what are you

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,840
talking about this is like a fear of

119
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,240
mine that's probably nobody else has

120
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,720
okay when I go to like CVS or like

121
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,759
Walgreens or

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,360
something it's mostly it's CVS now when

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,680
you go you can buy whatever you wanted

124
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,520
to self checkout and then they give you

125
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,280
the option no receipt or print receipt

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
and I always said no receipt because I

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,440
know how much I get is worth and I don't

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,440
need to read it and I don't want to

129
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,919
throw it away so I hit no receipt and

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,080
then my biggest fear is being accused of

131
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,280
stealing right after that moment of

132
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,360
hitting no receipt from walking from the

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,320
self checkout to the exit I pray for the

134
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,400
day someone checks me with that [ __ ]

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,880
I've come to find out something recently

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,160
I think I'm an

137
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,520
oversharer really yes I think it's cuz

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,280
you never stop you have a motor mouth so

139
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,199
it's like I I don't think you're an

140
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,960
oversharer I just think you talk way too

141
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,199
[ __ ] much which then needs to

142
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,680
overshare don't I don't even think you

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,400
overshare cuz a lot of the things you're

144
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,880
saying isn't like you're oversharing

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000

about like that I think is just so funny

314
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,000
is when people ask me a triplet related

315
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,839
question like oh like whatever [ __ ]

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,440

317
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,760

00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,800
forehead they always are like oh it's

322
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,720
probably so annoying like you probably

323
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,240
get this all the time but and then they

324
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,800
go on to proceed to ask 15 plus

325
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,040
questions all the time we should do

326
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,880
another YouTube video I think we have

327
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,360
one from forever ago like the most asked

328
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,040
questions about triplets well it's just

329
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,440
like dude if you're going to say out

330
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,760
loud like oh you probably get this all

331
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,440
the time you're probably so annoyed and

332
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,199
then you're going to continue I've never

333
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,760
got that I've never understood that if

334
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:39,720
someone's like oh this is going to be

335
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,959
annoying but and then they proceed to do

336
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
something or like someone comes out to

337
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,639
me day this is probably annoying but and

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,399
then one of my biggest triplet P stop

339
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,959
announcing you're going Anno my biggest

340
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,600
triplet pet peeve is when two of us are

341
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,959
away from the other one where's Matt no

342
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,880
wrong that's one of mine well that's

343
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,360
that's definitely one of mine but it's

344
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,760
when people call us twins when one of us

345
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,519
after they know that we're triplets like

346
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,639
you know we're triplets that's fully in

347
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,959
your head but then you call it like I'm

348
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,199

373
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,160
don't know why this really coexists in

374
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
my brain when I think of someone with a

375
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,480
visor but you're in the

376
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,000
way what like move over I feel like

377
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,120
every time someone has a visor on

378
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,920

379
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240

380
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,920

382
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,000
someone has a visor on and they're just

383
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,680
standing in my [ __ ] way I don't

384
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,759
