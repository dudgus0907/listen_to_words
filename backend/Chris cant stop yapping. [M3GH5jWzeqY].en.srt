look very like ninjas

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,680
mysterious Mage in my neck got a

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,199
crickety old neck I think need a haircut

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,239
I think that we should do we should do

24
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,120
everything self beneficial at the same

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,000
time like a massage a chiropractor and a

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,960
haircut say I would love to go to a

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,559
chiropractor I really think that a video

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
of Nick getting cracked where they like

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,360
put the mic on his spine and then they

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,080
go breathe in and then they go like that

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,759
would be like that's the one thing I've

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,119
actually thought about I'm like I I

33
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,280
think out of all the like embarrassing

34
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,240
content of me out on the internet that's

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,400
something I think where I'm going to

36
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,119
draw the line really chiropracting if I

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,960
go to a chiropractor it will probably be

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,720
a personal Endeavor that will not be

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,360
documented no we should do it and get

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,960
the chiropractor to come to our house

41
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,159
and set up everything in our living room

42
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,960
and then just like Vlog a whole if we

43
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,360
could get a licensed chiropractor in our

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,880
home I'd do it okay today we don't have

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,079
any topics but filming a car video

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,439
without a topic is like finding the

47
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,240
dusty book what does that mean like you

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,600
know sometimes you see the book you

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,520
shake off the dust and it's always like

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,040
the one you need you know in the movies

51
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,880
when they're like what do you know about

52
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,600
Dusty books what do you know about

53
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,799
reading what I'm saying is like do you

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,159
know when the videos or like in the in

55
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,960
the Disney [Â __Â ] like whenever they find

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,479
the book that they like need to like

57
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,200
solve the problem that's occurring it's

58
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,759
always like Dusty and like hasn't been

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,320
touched for years okay that's what

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,479
filming a car video with no topic feels

61
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,520
like it's like get I don't get the

62
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,560
corespondence of one another well just

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
like we need to get that Dusty book dude

64
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,920
I hate when people are driving around on

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,920
Teslas cuz it literally sounds like a

66
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,840
UFO of D no I'll be my I'll be like I'll

67
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,640
be in like I don't even know say it your

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,280
room that's what you're going to say

69
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,440
just say your bedroom right like say

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,640
bedroom but I also say like a restaurant

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,959
like I could like multiple stories up in

72
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,200
a building I will always hear a Tesla

73
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
it's not a Tesla it's an electric car

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,920
it's like all forms of electric vehicles

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,680
dude it's obnoxious like I'm just saying

76
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,480
if everyone if everyone on the road gets

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,879
an electric vehicle it's going to sound

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
like aliens are out to get us the whole

79
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,720
day literally they need to lower that

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,959
like silence that no I feel I fully

81
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,760
agree I feel like I have to turn around

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,200
with like ray gun and shoot whoever's

83
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,519
coming toward me no it's terrible okay

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
like I feel like it's going to be an

85
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,159
automatic alien battle the second

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
electric I don't feel like that I don't

87
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
feel like that at all well no I'm

88
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,319

two weeks that I just want to bring up

151
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,479

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,560
Chick-fil-A is ass I mean I completely

153
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
Chick-fil-A is just ass like every

154
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
single time I if you order Chick-fil-A

155
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,680
like like and it gets delivered to you

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,199
by the you could live 10 minutes from a

157
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,080
Chick-fil-A at

158
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,280
I I've been saying that for years is

159
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,680
like consistently the most ass food I've

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,840
ever had in my life I've been saying

161
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,240
that for so long out of all the fast

162
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,199
foods Chick-fil-A It Takes the Cake

163
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,720
dominates the worst [Â __Â ] you want

164
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,120
know what the worst actually like cuz

165
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,720
the reason I bring it up and why I

166
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,639
express my the fries that are like the

167
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,240

I bring it up is cuz Chick-fil-A had so

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,759
much hey and like has height I think

174
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,759
and

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,080

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,560
lot how how little people really need to

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,280
just like speak

183
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,919
yeah dou down on that you're thinking of

184
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,400
me though no a lot of people I look at

185
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,520
and I'm like H you could benefit a lot

186
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,919
from shutting your [Â __Â ] mouth I agree

187
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,080
I think that's something you should try

188
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,639
and oh like there's some people that

189
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,919
like talk a lot and I love that they

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,599
talk I love listening to people but

191
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,759
there's some people wait what no you

192
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,639
don't no there are some people that like

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,160
tell me stories like oh I love listening

194
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,520
to you like genuinely there's people out

195
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
there that talk and I'm like I will

196
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,199
listen I could sit with you for 24 hours

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,360
you could talk to me all day yeah and

198
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,560
then there's some there's also sometimes

199
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,599
like I'll be outside and I'll see

200
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,120

201
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,800

it like sounds creepy if I describe it

208
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,960

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,400

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,360
bizarre but when there's people out in

215
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,759

love seeing people smile like doing

220
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,560
stuff yeah like if someone I saw some

221
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
lady we went out to eat today and she

222
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,240
was like a literally and it sounds like

223
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm a stalker psychopath like fully

224
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,080
across the restaurant and she was like

225
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
sitting with her whole family just

226
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,639
smiling eating food and I'm like I hope

227
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,360
that she's having the best day ever yeah

228
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,960
see I don't think that's creepy at all

229
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
who's off I was going to say something

230
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,400
but then Nick fully interrupted me you

231
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
all you've done is you you have to not

232
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,240
be mad when you get interrupted when you

233
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,960
interrupt people to say stupid R number

234
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,159
one number one yes no I was going to say

235
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
something but one of you guys like

236
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,919
screwed do you have to keep saying I'm

237
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,639
going to say something or what am I

238
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,599
going to

239
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,000
say so much about I have so much on my

240
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,440
mind that like the new thought always

241
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,720
just knocks out the old one but it

242
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,479
doesn't go far it just like bumps it

243
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,959
back in the the brain like adding to a

244
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,880
que yes like I have like a cue of

245
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,800
thoughts at all time and then it's

246
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,760
either like it just goes blank like the

247
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,159
motherboard overloads and then it's just

248
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,599
like whoop and then I just so this is

249
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,919
why you accidentally let out words like

250
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,519
water bottle correct cuz then it's just

251
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,080
like white like nothing and then do you

252
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,480
know like how you view a computer how

253
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,959
it's like all those green tabs with the

254
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,160
funky words like think of that as like

255
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,560
my thoughts and it's just like piling on

256
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,079
and I have a ton of tabs like loading in

257
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,480
and then I like click one and then I

258
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,959
accidentally hit escape and like

259
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,279
everything closed like that's how my

260
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,760
brain is so that's why like when I say

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,480
things you're always like oh you're

262
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,920
repeating yourself or it's like oh cuz

263
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,399
it's like my brain is gener like a

264
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,000
software like it's like okay thought

265
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,079
thought thought thought new thought I

266
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,640
boom on the page but then I exit out and

267
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,279
then I minimize and it's down here and

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,880
then I full screen it goes in between

269
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,279
these two tabs but it's just like my

270
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,399
brain is full and then I forget a lot

271
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm going to end this with I think I

272
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,440
need ADHD or something I'm going to end

273
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,640
it with one question do you have

274
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
anything to say right now do you know I

275
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,480
know what happened to me the other day

276
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,279
yeah this story this is what I have to

277
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,320
say I was writing something down and I

278
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,480
started like a list and I like formatted

279
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,680
the list of like like on the top it was

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
like formatted the list no I needed to

281
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,279
make a list of like things to do or

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
something I don't know what it was like

283
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,200
it was either a list of like things I

284
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,839

289
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,320
put number one and by the time I put the

290
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,200

little less you know move on um Chris

324
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,519
shut up I always think what your life

325
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,920
would be and how it would change if I

326
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,200
never spoke again I think that too

327
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,839
sometimes let's try it okay I was

328
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
thinking the other day see the the funny

329
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,800
thing is to me he can't not like it'll

330
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,720
break in 5 minutes yeah you will but I

331
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,240
was I was talking to someone day and I

332
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,480
was like it's crazy that I think that I

333
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,040
will spend more than half of my life in

334
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,160
some type of mode of

335
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,720
transportation whether it's a plane a

336
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,680
car a train um that's not even close to

337
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,079
the truth Nick cuz you you sleep in a a

338
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,160
bed every day so no matter what within a

339
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,279
okay

340
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,160
okay I have to pee I have to pee so bad

341
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,680
please go home please half half is

342
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,000
probably dramatic but I think a solid

343
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,839
third I think think I've traveled more

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
than I've slept literally I feel like

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm all obviously not true if you add up

346
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,519
like walk if walking counts I you have

347
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,279
to keep in mind the amount of night 100%

348
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,720
I have you have to keep in amount the

349
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,800
amount of night sleeps that we've gone

350
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,480
on listen if you're asleep in the car I

351
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,360

our career is also this so even

353
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,720

the car L we're not traveling right now

355
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,199

just said you were ex shout

387
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,120
out I wrote this down as well my list of

388
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,440
thoughts it pisses me off so much when

389
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,079
someone says baking isn't cooking like

390
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,800
baking is baking yes but it is

391
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,279
definitely also cooking like people

392
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,480
would be like oh like if you bake

393
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,320
something like if you bake something

394
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,560
you're also be like I'm cooking later

395
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,959
cuz if you put something in the oven you

396
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,680
put something in the oven if baking is

397
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,199
100% cooking something mixing

398
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,920
ingredients and cooking and heating up

399
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,079
or freezing and then coming out with a

400
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,519
final product you just cooked I don't

401
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,240
care if it's Absol you know what I mean

402
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,360
baking is 100% a form of cooking and if

403
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,000
you disagree you can [Â __Â ] yourself

404
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
correct but it pisses me off I saw

405
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,480

406
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,440
