1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,220

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,819

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,079
that we laugh and keep the spunk is

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,660
everyone has to say a joke and we have

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,100
to like fake laugh yes I'm not famous

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,980
yeah I'm not doing that if the joke's

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,520
funny I'll laugh okay why does Frosty

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,520
the Snowman

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,180
not have a nose

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,960
the reindeer ate it off

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,960
he ain't [ __ ] with the haters

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,160
low-key I agree with them I feel bad

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,899
like you don't even [ __ ] with people you

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,580
had me at the hook like a lot of people

20
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
like they put on cologne perfume they

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,600
want people to smell them Frosty even

want to smell you bro I love that all

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,439
right moving on we're gonna basically

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,360
talk about specific ways that we think

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,100
would make someone go crazy or like how

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,600
to Gaslight someone I don't know why

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,860
this is kind of like a video topic we

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,860
have but I think it's

29
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,060
have like like they like carve into the

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,460
cement wall how many days in they're

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,840
gonna they're like they're into their

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,520
sentence they are and they like carve

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,020
into the wall I'm gonna start doing that

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,259
on my wall when I wake up in the morning

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,380
like every day just like I wake up draw

36
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,600
a tally that's kind of terrible I was

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,820
just Cherry that's not a league for you

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,560

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,240
Pepsi Cherry can you [ __ ] all right

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,340
yeah I'm going to my [ __ ] thing okay

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,820
do you guys let me hear online yes yeah

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,000
okay I would hide a paper clip and like

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,459
say it's the Nick in your room every

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
single day until you find at least one

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,239
and then you just like they just keep

46
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,340
popping up out of nowhere

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,500
like a paperclip like under your like

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,420
you're like playing I don't like this

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,920
one why I don't think it'd make me go

50
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,660
that crazy because I have so much in my

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,400
room that I genuinely would just be like

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,319
oh when did I put these here no like

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,739
wanted like each pocket of your clothes

54
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,360
one in like like under your candle I

55
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,160
wanna know everything you touched like

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,200
it's funny or your phone I think if you

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,959
did this to me I'd find the first

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,640
[ __ ] what is it per clip I was like

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,020
toothpick I would find the first paper

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,959
that would be good I find the first

61
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,540
paper clip within 24 hours that's not

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,760
true I can almost get we're doing I will

63
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,379
literally make a video I will at a

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,120
random day this month start doing it to

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,800
my room no a random day this month I'll

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,300
hide a paper clip somewhere in your room

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,000
and I promise you you won't find it

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,560
within 24 hours okay how much money put

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,560

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,060
mouth is oh my God

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,220
however oh yeah we can what's your bet

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,860
the yesterday we made it in the hot tubs

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,680
however many toothpicks you can hide in

74
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,180
my room every 24 hours until I find one

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,180
I'm catching you off guard I'll give you

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,519
just tell me when you start June so it

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,519
will be in June okay listen

78
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,040
made a bet yesterday and I think that

79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,739
it's [ __ ] hilarious so we're gonna

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
share with you guys basically I what was

81
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,360
the context

82
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,459
I went under water in the hot tub and I

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,340
scared Matt because I was under for like

84
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,220
45 seconds I don't know what came over

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,080
me but I felt so much peace no you said

86
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,879
that you saw a tick tock on some guy

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,099
that is true he does underwater

88
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,640
underwater meditation and he trains

89
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,940
himself every day to to feel more and

90
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,940
more

91
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,840
like do you mind he trains every single

92
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,519
day to feel like I want to get more

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,680
light in here like I want to feel the

94
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,080
light it's bright no he trains every day

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,819
to like try and stay underwater longer

96
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,239
and now like he's been training for like

97
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,860
a month

98
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,260
seven minutes so Nick's convinced that

99
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,900
if he goes to the pool every single

100
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,239
night then he can keep his head under

101
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,160
the water and train himself to get to

102
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,320
the point where it's like he can be

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,120
underwater for like a very long help so

104
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,460
me and Matt have a bet that the day

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,139
summer starts like the day that sounds

106
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,840
like summer switches to Autumn whatever

107
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,740
when summer switches to fall so by the

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,139
Fall I have to to gain the ability to

109
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,860
train to stay underwater for three

110
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:47,759
minutes at a time and basically I owe

111
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,220
Matt 600 and that's like a crazy amount

112
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,320
of money I know like if this is the most

113
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,100
comfortable bet someone could ever know

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm a hundred percent I'm like

115
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,220
going to train and do and you guys don't

116
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,540
even know there's like rules and

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,040
guidelines to this [ __ ] like Nick

118
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,780
literally has it set up so that if like

119
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,699
someone jumps in the pool he gets like a

120
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,440
reset date like they ain't fully run in

121
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,600
them

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,699
I said I'd I'd befriend someone who uses

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,800
a white noise machine and then buy the

124
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,840
exact same white noise machine but

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,460
replace it with an audio file that's

126
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,620
slightly different from the one that's

127
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,840
in there so it'd be almost exactly the

128
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,280
same but it would occasionally throw

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,840
something in that he didn't know was

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,580
there she didn't know was there it's

131
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,120
like throw them off like in their sleep

132
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,120
yeah

133
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,620
this seems premeditated

134
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,240
Nick had this no because I sleep with a

135
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,740
fan noise that I pull up on YouTube and

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,020
if I played like the rock have you seen

137
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,759
the guy like an ad popped up I'd wake up

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,259
afraid so I thought when we thought of

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
the video idea I'd take someone's like

140
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,080
white noise machine by the exact same

141
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,660
one and then replace the audio you want

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,000
to know what's actually insane what you

143
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,800
have hooked me to use fan noises because

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,900
I never needed anything I never did it

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,580
but Nick and Nathan both of them need

146
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,199
fancy sleep so every time I would sleep

147
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,620
but then they got me used to it but

148
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,880
there's this YouTube video

149
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,880
[Laughter]

150
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,740
what I don't know I thought of a joke

151
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,500
but it was like every six hours it just

152
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,240
cuts the fan and I think that my body is

153
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,400
auto waking up the second it ends

154
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,160
because like oh it's good I'll wake up

155
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,680
every night when the fan is over bye

156
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,139
every morning and it like never stops

157
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,699
right but like I genuinely think I'm

158
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,960
waking up the second it ends do you know

159
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,979
a little water drop thing that you put

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,060
in the water and you squeeze the end

161
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,560
that goes up the tube like the

162
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,539
penicillin thing like the old yes yes

163
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,520
I would take it by that and fill it with

164
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,919
water and then go to someone's sock

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,080
drawer and dampen every song just a

166
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,580
little bit like like just like two drops

167
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,380
so that they can feel it enough when

168
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,479
they put the sock on but it's just like

169
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,220
in one spot there's a list it would dry

170
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,100
by the time I put this on I agree

171
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,860
no like every like I know like say

172
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,360
you're you put socks aside to wear those

173
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,160
and you like walk away real quick like

174
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,740
to brush your teeth and get them a

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
little damp every time like just plan

176
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,580
ahead like this is like too strategic I

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,500
think dude can we just go with the video

178
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,660
like okay that's fine no it's good cool

179
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,160
okay all right the only reason I

180
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,020
wouldn't like that is because like I

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,300
only put socks on to like start my day

182
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,800

Massachusetts yeah

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,300
imagine I'm driving home to our house

216
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,759
and then I pull into the driveway that's

217
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,399
one before our normal house like the one

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,860
before our drive that's so and then I

219
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,940
just go oh sorry I forgot and then I

220
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,560
pull out and then drive into the other

221
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,300
one dude I like actually really check in

222
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,520
on you right because I've been driving

223
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,099
to that other one for how many I

224
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,180
actually have a really similar one

225
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,860
thousands would it be I think I'd

226
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,260
immediately start panicking because if

227
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,120
you think about it think about this

228
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,740
think about this you're like never in

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,660
someone's driveway unless you're like

230
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,420
their friend like a driveway is kind of

231
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,680
like an intimate place to be

232
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,800
if you accidentally driving to someone's

233
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,800
driving

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
are you ever driving down straight years

235
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
like go the other way it's like pulling

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,120
someone's driveway for a second yeah I

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,140
feel like I'm trespassing I'm doing too

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
much I feel like I'm in this person's

239
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,220
way link driveways are kind of intimate

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,399
that's really weird sure that's not

241
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,399
weird

242
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,820
like no but it's not like I'm being

243
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,140
rushed or anything like I'm the only car

244
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,300
in the road and I just pull into that

245
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,820
one oh my bad I forgot no it'd be really

246
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,360
weird what do you no um a driveways for

247
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,880
cars only like listen imagine someone's

248
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,560
just standing in your driveway like nah

249
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,760
you get home and they're just landing

250
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,320
something crazy and they're just

251
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,580
standing okay hold on let me read

252
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,260
another one myself that's actually

253
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,060
terrifying okay I get it if someone

254
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,100
pulls a car in but if someone was just

255
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,399
standing at my driveway I'd [ __ ]

256
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,620
freak the [ __ ] out

257
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
imagine imagine you had like a clock

258
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,160
Chris imagine you had like a clock in

259
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
your room like an alarm clock or a

260
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,560
digital clock anything and I changed it

261
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,380
three minutes every three days oh my

262
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,060
like it went three minutes I forgot to

263
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,680
throw the clock out before I would catch

264
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,300
on way too quick I don't think you

265
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,740
before you beat like 10 minutes I'd

266
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,240
throw the clock the second I set the

267
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,800
alarm and I was waking up at like a

268
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,740
different time I'd be like what dude

269
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,380
like if I didn't say like alarm I said

270
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,240
clock yeah but if he used that he

271
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,740
changed it by three minutes it was like

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,420
you said it was like an alarm clock so

273
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,519
if I had an alarm clock and it said like

274
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,339
9 30 and I went in the shower came back

275
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
at nine like at 10 and it didn't say 10

276
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,100
I'd be like oh it's off by a couple of

277
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,080
minutes okay whatever this is a bad one

278
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,240
I guess whatever I don't even know I

279
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,980
don't know

280
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,540
until you explained yourself I would

281
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,339
know right away the second my alarm

282
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,100
clock has changed three minutes okay

283
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,360
okay that's a little insane I would go

284
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,980
on my phone and be like oh it's wrong

285
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
literally like this year during like the

286
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,500
daylight savings things you didn't

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,420
realize that it happened and when it

288
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
said from like 2 A.M to like 3 A.M well

289
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,120
that's a lot more reasonable because

290
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,399
it's one hour and it's Universal for

291
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,320
everybody's clock not just mine

292
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,120
everyone's clock went forward an hour

293
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,740
not just mine yeah but if you can't even

294
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,140
realize that everyone's clock's going

295
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,279
forward all right way different story I

296
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,279
disagree that you're wrong

297
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,560
we don't have to argue about it anymore

298
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,540
because I know my stance and you know

299
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,480
yours let the people speak

300
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,920
like you're saying yeah

301
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,180
voice your opinion shut the [ __ ] up

302
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,399
idiot let me talk let me go listen if

303
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,680
just my alarm is changing by three

304
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,720
minutes and everyone else's is the same

305
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,880
I'll probably notice that mine won't

306
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,100
change by three minutes but if every

307
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,440
[ __ ] clock worldwide changes by an

308
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,360
hour then everyone would be on the same

309
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,860
page they'd be like oh it all changed an

310
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,899
hour and even if I'm not you're I'm

311
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,339
saying I'm denying you even realize that

312
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,560
it doesn't matter if I realized it

313
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,300
because it doesn't matter okay are you

314
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,240
dumb or stupid let us know like legit

315
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,620
it's almost crazy

316
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,040
[ __ ] you Matt okay I was doing your

317
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,079
laundry and I cut tiny little holes in

318
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,260
your shirts I know right away again too

319
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,420
but like every microscopicles and

320
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:08,339
where's the location I don't know

321
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,899
Microsoft no like a pin un pinhole that

322
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,420
would freak me the [ __ ] out like little

323
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,880
microscopic but where would they be I

324
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,300
just do one every single time oh my God

325
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,300
somewhere

326
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,380
you would need to be a legit

327
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,980
Mastermind to pull this one off okay

328
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,320
okay but it's like replace so set

329
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,540
let's get there

330
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,560
start with like a weird item of clothing

331
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:41,120
like underwear or socks I'm hooked right

332
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,899
and then start just making them small

333
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,360
just making them making making them

334
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,160
shut the [ __ ] up

335
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,320
smaller every time they wear it so like

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,180
they wear socks and like when you put

337
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,880
them in the laundry like say like you're

338
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,200
in the perfect world today

339
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,240
like no don't even shrink them a little

340
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
fully replace them with like a size down

341
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,959
it's like if the underwear is like an

342
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,700
extra large buy them large and then just

343
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,620
replace it oh here you go and like but

344
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,360
scrape off the L so they can't tell and

345
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,980
then they'd wear it again oh it was a

346
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,600
little tighter that time to replace it

347
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,459
with a medium and then but it's they're

348
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,920
gonna get to like all their clothes it's

349
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,480
just like get Dumbo this actually works

350
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,980
better every time they wear it like that

351
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,959
would freaking get the [ __ ] out better

352
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,100
this works better if that person's owner

353
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,600
does the laundry because then they can't

354
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,180
blame it on like oh I'm like if my

355
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,639
clothes were like rapidly like lowering

356
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,320
in size like all of them like every time

357
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,360
I wore it it was just coming I'd like it

358
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,440
so mad at who's doing my laundry when

359
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,540
you meet someone for the first time

360
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,700
saying like oh you know who you look

361
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,220

gravity ball

500
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,820
maybe an illusion you decide this looks

501
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,160
like exactly what they were promoting in

502
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,960
the Power Rangers all the people to turn

503
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,520
bad you couldn't understand even a

504
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,179
grocery bag and every time you help

505
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,400
someone carry it from the store

506
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:52,860

508
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,100

510
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,520
your man was but sometimes you say one

511
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,320
you give us like a glimpse of what

512
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,580
you're about to get into say the whole

513
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,919
goddamn maybe that's what you really

514
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,919
should do take that with life okay

515
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,200
what are you talking about you look like

516
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,120
the type of guy to not even say a

517
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
sentence fully in a cart video because

518
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,980
you you're like

519
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,140
let me put a mirror right here like this

520
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,480
you're like a record high of 10

521
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,280
sentences a video so I'd zip your lips

522
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,280
at least mine makes I have more room

523
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,360
[ __ ] you you have more room for error

524
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,400
because you just black if I went up to

525
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,780
bat a thousand times I'd probably strike

526
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,059
out more than you if you went up to bat

527
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,760
a hundred times correct so if you

528
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,460
straighten your probability okay would

529
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,230
you rather

530
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,440
anything more

531
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,140

536
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,740
