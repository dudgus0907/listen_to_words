1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,336
-Who doesn't love
Anne Hathaway?

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,704
Thank you for coming.
-That's very nice.

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:04,738
But you know when you have
a moment, you're just like,

4
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,739
"Oh, I'm gonna remember
that forever."

5
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,007
Thank you so much for that.

6
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,976
-There you go. It just happened.
Come on. The Roots.

7
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,745
-Thank you. Hi, everybody.

8
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,680
-Thank you for playing
"Reverse Charades" with me.

9
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,948
You're a great partner.
-Thank you.

10
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,850
You're a great partner.

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,218
-I mean, are you are you
competitive when you play games?

12
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,220
Do you play games at home?
-Oh, I don't mean to be.

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,522
-I know. Me neither.
-I don't mean to me.

14
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,756
But then you saw her over there,

15
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,157
I was like, "No, it's just
a nice, friendly game."

16
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,993
And then the last, I'm like,
"But the points are on.

17
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,161
Like, it's on."
-Let's go. I want to win this.

18
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,331
-Something takes over.
I'm less competitive now.

19
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,699
-Why?
-Kids.

20
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,201
-Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,103
-I think maybe being competitive
is genetic,

22
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,406
because my kids are, like --
They're competitive, too.

23
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,008
And it turns out
motherhood has softened me,

24
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,009
and I like to watch them win.

25
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,043
-Yeah.
-Aww.

26
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,412
-My kids are
very competitive, too.

27
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,015
Well, my one daughter is.
Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,083
The other one doesn't
really care.

29
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,785
She's like, "That's fun.
It's all good."

30
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,387
But the other one
really wants to win.

31
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,489
And I don't throw the games.

32
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,158
You know, I go --
I really -- And I play for --

33
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,360
I play for money, too.

34
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,632
Are you -- Is there a party game
that you're especially good at?

35
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,401
-Es-- No.

36
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,203
I mean, you know,
I was playing a game --

37
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:13,340
We play a lot of PokÃ©mon
and we play a lot of Trouble

38
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,508
and Sorry!

39
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,877
But there is a game --
I was working last week

40
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,313
and I was on set, and we were
just passing the time.

41
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,281
And have you seen
that movie trivia game

42
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,383
where it's cards and they --
and it just asks you questions?

43
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,852
-Oh, yeah, I've seen --
Like, they have a bunch of

44
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,887
quizzes, like sports and movies.

45
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,021
-And I was just having one
of those, like,

46
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,657
runs where I couldn't miss.

47
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,093
Like, I just knew and I was,
like, surprising myself.

48
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,394
-Well, you know your stuff.
You know movies.

49
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,063
-I didn't -- I mean,
apparently, I do.

50
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,798
And then I got to
this one question,

51
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,434
and they were like, "Oh, okay.

52
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,537
So, uh, junior executive
assistant, 'Devil Wears Prada.'"

53
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,539
I'm just like, "Emily Blunt."

54
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,041
And they were like, "No."

55
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,710
And it wasn't her. It was me.
So...

56
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,280
I was gonna say, "Wait..."

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,283
-But I was genuinely confused.
I'm like, "Wait, but it is her."

58
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,584
It is.
-"That was me, but I'm the..."

59
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,653
That's wild.
See, when it comes to you --

60
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,154
-Yeah, so...

61
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,990
-Do you ever -- Do you
kind of do a project

62
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,359
and then you kind of block it
out of your mind or no?

63
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,261
You just --
It just so happens you...

64
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,963
-I don't know.
I'm not huge on looking back.

65
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,899
It is kind of funny
when -- Like, because,

66
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,667
you know, I was in this movie
when I was 17 years old

67
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,935
called "The Princess Diaries."

68
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:15,936
-Yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]

69
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,407
-Have you seen it?
-I watch you all the time.

70
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,909
To this day, I watch you
all the time.

71
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:22,943
-Really?
-My family loves you.

72
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,611
-It must be your girls.
-We love you.

73
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,446
Yeah, they love you so much.

74
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,282
-I love that it's become kind of
one of those family touchstones.

75
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,051
So, anyway, people quote it
to me all the time,

76
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,420
and I don't know what
they're talking about.

77
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,688
I haven't seen it in a minute.

78
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,456
-But "Devil Wears Prada" --

79
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,426
I recently saw a photo
of you and Anna Wintour.

80
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,796
You made your kind of Broadway
debut together in

81
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,398
"Gutenberg! The Musical!"

82
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,599
You guys stood up.
-There she is.

83
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,468
-Did the crowd go nuts?

84
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,905
-So, they --
So, by the way, I have to say,

85
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,173
that's Josh Gad and that's
Andrew Rannells.

86
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,541
They're both dear friends.

87
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,844
And they're so -- They were
so brilliant in the show.

88
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,912
It was really next level.

89
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,149
And at the end of the show, they
invite two people up onstage.

90
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,751
And, so,
they said my name first,

91
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,153
and the audience had
a very nice reaction.

92
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,989
And then they said Anna's name,
and it was like rock star.

93
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,858
-Really?
-Yeah, rock star.

94
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,460
-Because you don't
really see Anna do many things

95
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,528
that are outside of her --

96
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,630
-Wear a trucker hat.
-Yes, exactly.

97
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,633
You'd never see Anna Wintour,
from Vogue, wear a trucker hat.

98
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,802
That's correct, yeah.
But everyone just went nuts.

99
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,904
She's also a New York icon.
-Oh, yeah.

100
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,906
-So I think
if she shows up at a pizzeria --

101
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,741
-Yeah, she's a New York icon.
She's a worldwide icon.

102
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,376
-She's a worldwide --
She's everything.

103
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,211
Is she fun
to share the stage with?

104
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,779
-Yeah. Yeah, really, really fun.

105
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,583
And just -- She's been
incredibly sweet to me,

106
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,584
and I'm very -- I'm just very
grateful for our relationship.

107
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,253
-She's so cool.
-She's so cool.

108
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,654
-She's so cool.
-So cool.

109
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,289
-Do you get nervous around --
I get a little nervous --

110
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,091
-I absolutely do.
-You do?

111
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,059
Now, I have less to lose,

112
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,661
because I'm never going to be
on the cover of Vogue,

113
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,530
so I have nothing
to worry about.

114
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,431
But she likes me, and we've been
friends for a long time,

115
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,700
so I kind of -- I'm comfy around
her, so I can --

116
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,269
-I don't mean to --
I try to keep it comfy.

117
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,637
I try to keep it cozy.

118
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,740
But inside, my heart is --
I just respect her so much.

119
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,874
-Yeah.

120
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,609
-But I feel very comfortable
around you.

121
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,845
-Yeah, good. You should be.
You should be.

122
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm your bud. No, please.

123
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,049
I totally -- I got the respect

124
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,617
and also the dig
at the same time.

125
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,953
So it was perfect.
-That's how well I know you.

126
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,721
That's how cozy I am.
-Yeah, exactly.

127
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,623
You know, I saw you,
by the way --

128
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,592
I was going to say
on Broadway, but it wasn't.

129
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,160
It was Shakespeare in the Park.

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,862
-You were there?
-Yeah, I came to see you.

131
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,530
Absolutely.
I'm a big fan. Yeah.

132
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,531
You did that.

133
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,301
-I feel really bad about
the dig now.

134
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,236
-You better keep digging me.
Are you kidding me?

135
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,372
I have -- Please, if you don't
laugh yourself, then come on.

136
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,608
I saw you,
and it was at the...

137
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,943
-"Twelfth Night"
at the Delacorte Theater.

138
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,044
-...Delacorte Theater.
-Yeah.

139
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,278
-You were amazing.
Do you get nervous?

140
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,780
Does anything go wrong?

141
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,315
Nothing went wrong
when I saw you.

142
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,716
-Nothing went wrong?
Thank goodness.

143
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,951
-No, you were perfect.

144
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,018
-Well, because --
So, the Delacorte Theater

145
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,654
is an outdoor theater in
Central Park.

146
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,489
And, so --
-And you're doing Shakespeare.

147
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,791
-Doing Shakespeare.

148
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,093
And it rained
almost every night.

149
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,661
And, so,
but it's kind of amazing,

150
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,897
because every night,
the last line of the show,

151
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,067
which we actually sang, was for
the rain, it raineth every day.

152
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,468
And so the audience,
at that moment,

153
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,836
always burst out laughing.

154
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,238
And the whole show was
so joyful.

155
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,739
I had such a wonderful time.

156
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,908
But one night, something --
I don't know if it went wrong,

157
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,543
but something happened.

158
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,211
And, so, there's this scene.

159
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,747
My character, Viola --
she comes onto the stage.

160
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,849
And I knew
that the line was funny,

161
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,252
but I couldn't figure out
how to make it funny.

162
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,287
So every night, I was
just trying something,

163
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,655
just anything I could think of.

164
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,923
And I was,
you know, go out there,

165
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,325
audience wouldn't laugh,
and I was like, "Tomorrow."

166
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,263
And then, one night, I went out
there and I said the line,

167
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,231
and just the house went down.

168
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,666
-You killed it.
-Killed.

169
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,703
And I was like, "Oh, I found it.
This is such a good feeling."

170
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,238
And I just like --
And so then, of course,

171
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,274
I leaned into it,
because you do.

172
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,042
And so I lean into it
and I'm just --

173
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,544
The audience
is losing their minds.

174
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,746
I look under the wings,
the cast is losing their minds.

175
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,015
I'm high-fiving myself
in my head.

176
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,851
I'm just like, "I've arrived.
This is happening."

177
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,086
And I get offstage
and I'm just like, "Well..."

178
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,723
And they go,
"Did you see the raccoons?"

179
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,660
And I'm like, "The...what?"

180
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,261
And then they just go,
"Behind you.

181
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:05,566
As soon as you came onstage,
a family of raccoons came out.

182
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,634
They were so cute.

183
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,536
Couldn't focus on the scene
because the raccoons

184
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,938
were so cute."

185
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:15,008
So I was like, "Well, actually,
high five to the raccoons."

186
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,477
-See?
You got to work with everybody.

187
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,712
-Absolutely.

188
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,781
-You got to work --
You play well with others.

189
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,649
Let's talk about
"The Idea of You."

190
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,585
Oh, my gosh, buddy.

191
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,720
The trailer alone has
gotten over 125 million views.

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,623
-Yeah.
-It crushed, broke the record.

193
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,594
Most-watched trailer of
any streaming movie in history.

194
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,362
Can we set up what
the movie's about?

195
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,730
-Oh, sure, sure.

196
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,532
The story is
about SolÃ¨ne Marchand,

197
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,968
who is a woman
who lives in Silver Lake.

198
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,936
She's a gallery owner.

199
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,073
She's a mom and she's got
this really wonderful life.

200
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,209
And she unexpectedly meets
the lead singer

201
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,944
of the biggest boy band
in the world,

202
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,546
a 24-year-old young man
named Hayes Campbell.

203
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,580
-Yeah.

204
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,883
-And he thinks
she's kind of great.

205
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,385
And so the story is about
how they fall in love.

206
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,988
-Yeah. Because you're just a mom
and you're chaperoning

207
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,556
this thing
and you go to this thing

208
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,857
and then you see this boy band.

209
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,226
-I love hearing you describe
my movie.

210
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,961
"Just a mom in this thing."

211
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,096
-Yeah, you're a mom
in this thing.

212
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,064
That's how I described it.

213
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,434
Mom is chaperoning,
like, a Coachella type of thing,

214
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,538
like a giant outdoor festival
thing, and the biggest boy band

215
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,573
in the world,
and then the lead singer --

216
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,544
-Oh, yes, so, my daughter
is off watching St. Vincent.

217
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,379
Because she doesn't like
the boy band anymore.

218
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,114
She liked them in seventh grade.

219
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,149
But, anyway,
I have a backstage pass,

220
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,251
so I'm a -- all-access thing.

221
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,352
I have to go to the bathroom.

222
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,954
Somebody tells me
where the trailers are.

223
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,391
I go and I walk
into the wrong trailer.

224
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:41,061
-Yeah. And the rest is --
High jinks ensues.

225
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,798
But remind me of the actor who
plays the lead singer.

226
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,933
-Nick Galitzine.

227
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,135
-Oh, man,
you guys have great chemistry.

228
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,703
Did you know when he
was auditioning?

229
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,572
You go, "Oh, this the guy."
-Oh, yeah.

230
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,441
Yeah, no, as soon as he --
I actually burst out laughing

231
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:59,613
when he walked in, because --
Has anybody here read the book?

232
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,349
-No, we don't read.

233
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,984
-Well, you should.
It's fabulous.

234
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,118
-This is "The Tonight Show."

235
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,889
Yeah, you want to go over
to Stephen --

236
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,624
You want to go to
Stephen Colbert

237
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,060
if you want to get
people that read books.

238
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,862
We don't read.

239
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,233
Lame!

240
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,401
-Well, you have an awesome book
in store for you.

241
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,570
It's written by --
-Lame-O!

242
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,241
We do Audible here.
We do that. Does that count?

243
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:30,344
-I think it's time for you to --
to get me back.

244
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,312
-Yeah, I know.
-Okay, so --

245
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,248
-It's based on this book.

246
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,782
-What's a book?
-Yeah.

247
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,051
No, too late. No, too late.

248
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,521
But this is based
on the big best-selling book.

249
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,891
-Well, the book does have
a fan following somewhere.

250
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,327
And -- Anyway, and I think
the book is incredible.

251
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,329
And Hayes Campbell is so
beautifully written in the book,

252
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,631
and so we knew that we just
really needed to find

253
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,632
someone really special.

254
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,567
And he walked in, yeah,

255
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,335
and I just thought,
"Oh, that's Hayes Campbell."

256
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,137
And that was
almost two years ago.

257
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,805
And now Nick and I
have become really good friends,

258
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,641
and, yeah, it's opened up
in this beautiful way.

259
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,509
-It's really great.
I want to show everyone a clip.

260
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,311
Here's Anne Hathaway
in "The Idea of You."

261
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,312
Take a look.

262
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,556
-Hi again.

263
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,059
-Are you a part
of that ASMR community

264
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,661
that gets off on listening
to people pee?

265
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,062
-No, I wasn't --

266
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,297
-Because I don't think you can
just go around assuming --

267
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,565
-It's actually my trailer.

268
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,899
-What?

269
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,801
-It's not literally mine.
You know, I don't own it.

270
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,103
-This is your trailer?

271
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,605
-Yeah, I'm in the band.

272
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,006
We're performing on
the main stage.

273
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:37,044
You know, I'm Hayes Campbell.

274
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,745
-August Moon?

275
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,780
-Yeah.

276
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,316
-Well, I absolutely know
who you are.

277
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:47,221
Um, anyway...I'll...

278
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,160
-Yeah. Come on.
You know how to do it.

279
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,828
Anne Hathaway, everybody.

280
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,864
"The Idea of You"
begins streaming

281
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,999
on Prime Video this Thursday.

282
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,301
We'll be right back
with Melanie Lynskey.

283
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,302
Stick around, everybody.
