43
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,980

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,980
Hogwarts Express

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,560
because it feels like you and I are

46
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,560
having somewhere magic

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,319
because it feels like you and I are

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,080
headed somewhere magical

49
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,640
come on get back in bed laughter when

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,700
the second water comes out of your mouth

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,019
you might lose

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,840
that's what it should have been so we're

53
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,540
at both at one point all right guys so

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,220
we're changing our point system so that

55
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,500
you don't want points

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,180
and if you laugh you get a point if you

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,739
laugh at your own teammate so remote

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,780
that one because Nathan laughed at Chris

59
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,879

60
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,140
who you laugh at the second water comes

61
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,640
out of your mouth you get a point and

62
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,800
you don't want points if you are a

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,060
vegetable

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,900

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,900

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,400
