1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,640
As a founder, you are taking the biggest

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,880
bet and risk on yourself and your life.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,400
Being born in Algeria, my moonshot was

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
New York City and went straight to New

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
York. I don't have a proper education. I

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
don't have a proper sort of route to

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,720
becoming a founder. For me specifically,

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,840
I don't have the option to to fail. And

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,039
so giving up is absolutely not on the

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,680
table. Every decision I make, I doubt.

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,400
But then there is a stubborn persona in

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
me. So, as long as your vision is the

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,440
same and consistent and what you're

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,360
delivering is clear to the world, how

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,000
you get there, it doesn't really matter.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,239
What is truly imperative is the

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
reinforced principle of believing. You

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,559
really have to believe that your product

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,239
is helping people. And I think

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,559
perseverance and any hardship I had

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
going through life helped me become a

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,320
better human first and then a better

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,320
founder.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,399
My name is Khaled Maneri, co-founder and

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
CEO of Selfbook. Selfpoke is really

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
providing the infrastructure for travel.

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,880
So if someone is on the website and have

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
intent to book that hotel, we should

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
eliminate as much friction as possible

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
to increase conversion. Before self

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,320
book, no hotel in the world could accept

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,799
Apple Pay for instance. And so we

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,000
brought in the digital wallets into the

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
industry. And then now we're adding much

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
more features to streamline the

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
experience even more.

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,400
Being born in Algeria, obviously

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,560
geopolitically we were restricted. We

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,479
couldn't travel. When the pandemic was

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
an example for a lot of people how to

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,799
they felt the need to travel but they

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,799
couldn't. So imagine a world in Algeria

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,799
where you actually can't travel because

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,399
it's impossible to get a visa or

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,119
especially as a young kid. So when I was

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,720
able to finally leave my moonshot was

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
New York City and went straight to New

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,880
York.

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,360
I walked up Fifth Avenue and discovered

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,600
the Apple

51
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,560
store. It was beautiful. I remember the

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,799
first iPod ad on Fifth Avenue or in Time

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
Square. That was a big iPod ad and I

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,039
remember how beautiful that product was.

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,599
I then learned design because they're

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,319
open for 24 hours. They let you use the

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,560
Mac. So that that changed my life

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,120
because I was really inspired by the

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
design and was really inspired by truly

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
obsession of excellence and product

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,760
excellence and so made me want to learn

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
how to design and maybe a better product

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,280
founder. Uh my business was purely

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,000
accidental. As an immigrant I had to do

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,120
any job to survive. I really wanted to

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,200
design products but I had no education

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,840
or network or any sort of background to

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,120
earn the benefit to go and work for

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,440
someone. I think not going to school

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,000
here or at all and not having a strong

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,080
network when you first move in to a

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,360
foreign country. You have to start

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,599
somewhere and so one friend can become

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
your network, right? When I was

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,840
fundraising, I didn't really know a lot

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,560
of people, right? I knew two or three

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,480
people. That's it. And the three of them

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,519
specifically that I have in mind helped

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,159
me with a build a network, fund raise.

80
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,000
They're still my close adviserss and

81
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,879
investors and even help me hire and get

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
new customers. So, you really can't go

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,799
at this alone, right? Some will change,

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,480
some will come, others will go. But

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,480
whether they will end up there or not,

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,440
they will always be part of your story.

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,200
We're going to touch us with our

88
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,920
fingers. When the iPhone launched in

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,080
2007, that sparked an idea to design an

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,840
app. No one had designed for mobile

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
before. So that was a really opportunity

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
for start as a starting point and that

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
was six agency. I called it six agency

94
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,040
because I was working out my apartment

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,680
6A. So the name was easy to come up

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,519
with. This app in particular, an idea

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,000
that we wanted to push to some of our

98
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
clients to say you don't need a full

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
catalog of products in front of a

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,200
customer on a small device. The app

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
would show you only one product per day.

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,079
Sometimes it could be a pencil from

103
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
Japan or it could be a beautiful watch.

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,240
It was highly curated. This is before

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
Instagram, before Tik Tok. And some of

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
the products and experiences that we

107
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,440
started adding is travel experiences.

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,400
When we showed these experiences,

109
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,960
engagement went up 70%. So people really

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,040
wanted to learn about an experience or

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
buy an experience. But it was really

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
hard to book on the app just because

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
there was no proper booking

114
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,919
infrastructure at a time. You had to

115
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,000
leave the app and go find the experience

116
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,000
somewhere else in some other marketplace

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,400
to book it. And that's what inspired us

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
to launch the travel app. It was an app

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
designed where you can easily discover a

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
hotel and book it right there and then.

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,759
But the month we were officially

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
launching it, the pandemic

123
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,240
started. Every hotel in the world shut

124
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,120
down. Yet I was thinking beyond that.

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,479
When the world comes back and they would

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,120
want to travel again. For me, every

127
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,160
decision I make I doubt. But then there

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,479
is a stubborn persona in me and a

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,360
relentless drive to create something

130
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,840
seamless. And so we had to think of ways

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
where we can pivot. Two key insight

132
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,080
points that I received during that time

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
was that no hotel in the world could

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
accept Apple Pay at the time. And

135
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,600
secondly is that launching a consumer

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
app is really really hard. So for us was

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,039
how can we leverage everything we built

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,160
and still provide this unique customer

139
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,800
experience to compete against OTAAS was

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
an impossible mission. Big OTAAS use

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,479
Apple Pay and they have a really

142
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,440
streamlined booking experience some at

143
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,840
least. Hotels didn't have that. So they

144
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,240
didn't have a leveled playing field. So,

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,600
Selfbook provided that to hotels instead

146
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,319
of them just continuing to give 25%

147
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,160
commission to OTAAS because a lack of a

148
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,560
streamlined booking experience. We were

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
able to bring that to them. Our view was

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,600
that if the guest really wants to book a

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,759
hotel and they are on the hotel website,

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
there's absolutely no reason for them to

153
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,000
leave the website and go to an OTAA to

154
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
book that same hotel. They should book

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,479
it right there and then. And that's

156
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,440
where Self really comes in to provide

157
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,520
this booking infrastructure married with

158
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,600
uh an end-to-end payment layer. We

159
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,479
believe that building a guest first

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,880
experience is so much better than just

161
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,160
building another B2B product even though

162
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
it was a B2B company. When we think of

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,360
the industry and we think of hotels as

164
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
clients, obviously the industry is left

165
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,160
behind from a technology perspective and

166
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,400
every product that they have was really

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
antiquated, especially on the guest

168
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,440
experience, right? Some of these systems

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,680
were built in the '60s. User behavior

170
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,000
was moving fast, but the change was

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,840
really slow. Our rapid growth since

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,919
launch was mainly driven by really being

173
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,680
charmingly relentless. You have to push

174
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,000
an agenda to an industry that I felt and

175
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,039
I still feel like the word sleepwalking

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,599
towards a precipice. A modern payment

177
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,919
solution like Apple Pay that uses a

178
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,080
cryptogram doesn't really work with a

179
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,400
system like Saber. And so we had to

180
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,400
build layers that allows a hotel that

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
still uses Saber to accept digital

182
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
wallet. And that was one of the

183
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,720
challenges that we solved. But then as

184
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,440
we kept on going, we've discovered a lot

185
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,080
of other challenges. And one of them is

186
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,440
providing flexibility in rates or even

187
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,840
providing a single API for platforms to

188
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,840
sell travel without having to build

189
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,720
every single component from the ground

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,400
up. And as a payment company at a core

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
or fintech company at a core,

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,280
transaction volume was key. And so we

193
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,599
had to achieve high GMV early on because

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,599
we were on growth mode. So you know we

195
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,360
went for hotels with higher average

196
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,080
daily rates or in the industry we call

197
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,280
it ADR so that we can achieve that

198
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,120
higher volume. Now again we scale beyond

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,639
just luxury but that was the starting

200
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,919
point and that's what helped us grow

201
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,720
really fast. Last year 2024 we 3xed our

202
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,680
revenue. We also helped hotel increase

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,800
conversion on their websites by 40% and

204
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
we also reduce cancellations by 44%. So

205
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,880
these are some of the ideas that we're

206
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,279
working on. If you go to an agentic on

207
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,039
AI search like Perplex City and you

208
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,480
search a hotel, the best hotel New York

209
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,120
City or I want to stay downtown or in

210
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
Soho, what if you can book them right

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,000
there and then without leaving

212
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,480
Perplexity? Bringing that to life, it's

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,320
so powerful. We're suited to build this

214
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
and we're super excited to deliver

215
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:06,800
it. Murakami says, "Pain is inevitable.

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,760
suffering is optional in his memoir. And

217
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,080
it's true as a founder, you're

218
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,560
constantly debating different ideas. A

219
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,959
key word that you know we hear every

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,200
hour of the day is trade-offs. You're

221
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,600
constantly trading off different ideas

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,920
and different assumptions. So sometimes

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,880
you get it wrong. Our biggest assumption

224
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,200
was that we could replace certain

225
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,440
systems, but that was more difficult

226
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,480
just because hotels are set in their

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,880
ways or perhaps they use an on-prem

228
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,000
system that it will take decades to

229
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,640
shift away from it. And so we had to

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,880
pivot our ways of thinking and work

231
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,480
cohesively with these systems and

232
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
integrate with them as opposed to

233
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,240
completely replacing them. really

234
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,720
focusing on what matters most and

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,440
focusing on what we are good at or we

236
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,640
are the best at. So a perfect example

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,200
Muse uh they are a cloudnative property

238
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,880
management system we're integrating with

239
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
and we're really excited to work with

240
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,839
them. We don't have to replace anything

241
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,880
they do but working together with them

242
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,279
we enhance the booking experience and so

243
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,640
building an integration layer across the

244
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,279
industry was key for our success and our

245
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,920
scale. The first customer on self-poke

246
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,600
is a resort called Nemain. This is a

247
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
time where almost every hotel in the

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,640
world was shut down. In July of 2020, I

249
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,800
flew to Pennsylvania and went to this

250
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
resort called Neolin and met with the

251
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,320
team, met with the owner and they were

252
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,560
really passionate about their product.

253
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
They were really passionate about

254
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,920
hospitality. Despite the fact that we

255
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
didn't have a full product yet and we

256
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
didn't have uh any track record at the

257
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
time or any client, they really believed

258
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,120
in us. They believed in the vision. It

259
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
wasn't because it was technical or it

260
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,000
would convert better or anything like

261
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,800
that. It was because we were obsessed

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,880
about providing guests a better user

263
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,360
experience. And the owner really cared

264
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,000
about that. She said at the time, if it

265
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,399
isospitable, we want it, right? And so

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,920
that's what we aimed for. And uh that

267
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
was our first client and they're still

268
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,800
our client. We're proud of that. Travel

269
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,880
is a human connection. Travel is a

270
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,839
gateway to culture. When you walk into a

271
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,920
store, you don't see just a sheet of

272
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,160
rates. You see products and you have a

273
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,120
conversation. So I think Self has big

274
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,880
visions of its existence, provide the

275
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
hospitality that the industry is meant

276
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
to provide anyways from day

277
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,560
one. Schumaker Formula 1 driver said

278
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,880
once there is passion, motivation is

279
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,360
there and I feel my passion was always

280
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,040
travel. So I was motivated to do so. I

281
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,519
think leaving Algeria was allowed me

282
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,760
to continue to dream bigger. Having that

283
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,240
freedom to create regardless of your

284
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,360
background or education or lack of which

285
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,560
in my case was really beneficial. It's

286
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:03,000
it's easy to give up. Um but you can't

287
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,000
be a quitter. You have to continue.
