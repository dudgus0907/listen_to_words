written down that are just like goofy

101
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,940
um my least favorite words and people

102
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,479
are like oh it's ethereal or ethereal

103
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,520
like [ __ ] what does that mean

104
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,060
shut up what does that mean it's like oh

105
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,380
like like I look ethereal or ethereal

106
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,199
like they think they're like a fairy

107
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,520
princess and so you look a little a

108
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,520
little better than mid

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:24,360
at all oh my God

110
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,699
I just hate that word oh my God I hate

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,100
that that was the best that was the most

112
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:34,080
you've ever flamed like something

113
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,740
he said you look a smidge better than

114
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,720
mid oh I love that word

115
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,160
thank God

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,960
it is true I really just don't think

117
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,360
that that word's ever suitable for like

118
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,060
a human being is that a real word let's

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,979
Google it is good to use if you enter

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,020
Narnia you can be like oh this place if

121
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,080
no yeah if you're if you're living out

122
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,940
of fable then go for it

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,860
it's extremely delicate and light in a

124
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,100
way that seems too perfect for this

125
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,100
world wow

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,280
you're so goofy I feel like you'd do

127
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,259
that that was that was so it's like

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,960
doing like the only way I would use that

129
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,479
is if I was like

130
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,460
I wouldn't use it yeah and maybe

131
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,259
entering Narnia or like visiting

132
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,240
Tinkerbell but those are like seems to

133
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,919
be the only two occasions also another

134
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,860
occasion is if I was in Smurf Village

135
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,560
for sure oh yeah you have to no question

136
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,440
about it damn bro Smurf at Loki she

137
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,660
gotta be rich

138
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,660
damn bro Smurf at low-key

139
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,160
this real like no it's because it's the

140
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,500
realest like that's like like are all

141
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,660
the smurfs gay

142
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,520
celibate

143
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,699
probably that option

144
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,740
I agree well if Gargamel made the first

145
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,139
Smurf at

146
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,300
how did the Smurf become

147
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,220
I don't need to know I also wrote down I

148
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,500
feel like can't get enough it's such an

149
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
underrated oh I love it it's such an

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,860
underrated way to say how someone feels

151
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,940
about something oh they just can't get

152
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,460
enough it's like one of those words

153
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,699
that's just like you can't get enough it

154
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,699
could be

155
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,400
oh I can't get enough of it like it

156
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,380
could be an exciting way you can make

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,060
fun of someone that way not that that's

158
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,460
a good thing no it's a great thing

159
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,060
correct like oh you just can't get it

160
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,060

don't know if this is [ __ ] up

166
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:54,539
but if someone was deaf I would whisper

167
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,759
surprises around them to feel risky you

168
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,919
know what I mean like if I had plans and

169
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,380
I couldn't tell anyone like if someone

170
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,940
was deaf or claimed to be deaf epic

171
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,099
whisper little secrets around them to

172
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,360
see like to feel just something you know

173
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,419
what I mean

174
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,740
Nick that's tough I'm [ __ ] up like if

175
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,699
someone's fully deaf and you're just

176
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,080

177
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,380

think kids should learn from their

206
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,959
lessons like I think if a kid spill

207
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,300
something in a store he should clean it

208
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,040
like even if he's like four like get to

210
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,459
thinks he can carry the coffee he can

211

what was I getting at you he was going

301
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,839

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
ahead of him and he wouldn't let me buy

307
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,839

309
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,680

the reason

320
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,399
I'm being rude about this is because I

321
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,279
got like I usually have so much patience

322
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,680

323
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,620

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,339
was keeping secrets in the bathroom

330
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,139

332
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,740

like the last time I saw a really old

334
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,279
person was at like the deli like I feel

335
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,300
like I haven't seen an old person in so

336
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,040
long

337
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,019
we don't really go to many functions

338
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,620
which the old would be attending no but

339
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:03,060
for real like I I think

340
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,220
no I just feel like I haven't seen like

341
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,839
someone old in so long like is that

342
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,399
weird to say

343
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,940
um a little I haven't seen a pregnant

344
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:16,320
woman in a while

345
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,760
okay she is bouncing on my booty what

346
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,940
are you saying what's your least

347
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,459
favorite word least favorite word oh I

348
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,920
got a really good word oh least favorite

349
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,320
or good like good okay like one of my

350
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,600
favorite words is grenade like it just

351
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,060
suits it so well I feel like a grenade

352
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,160
is perfect

353
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,800
if I was getting thrown I thought

354
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,199
through a grenade at me like I know like

355
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,420
bad is to come oh what else would you

356
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,300
think a grenade could be correct like if

357
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,459
I said like dude the only other thing

358
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,139
that I would think was near me if

359
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:54,899
someone yelled grenade is a pastry

360
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:56,100
what a grenade like say I'm a grenade if

361
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,380
it wasn't what it is it'd be a really

I've been trying to figure this out for

400
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,139

401
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,420

she was like oh it's gonna sit on like

412
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,940
my attic thing and we sat and she just

413
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,500
hummed the eggs at the wall and I was

414
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,540
like I was there because she had

415
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,980

416
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,480
regular eggs like no babies yes I don't

417
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,279
