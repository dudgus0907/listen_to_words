00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
What is up everybody and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,920
another Sterno triplets Friday video.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,679
Woo!

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,759
All right guys, as you know Nick is gay.

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,840
Nick is not only just gay, he's also

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,520
onethird of the Sterno triplets and our

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,720
leader. Yeah, leader. Yes, I hardly know

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,640
her. Anyway, because Nick is gay for

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
Pride Month, me and Matt are only

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,679
allowed to say yes to any question Nick

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,199
asks us. And we can we basically have to

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,600
We basically have to do everything Nick

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,520
says for the entire month of June. Hey,

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Nick. Hi, Matt. Happy Pride, bud.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
All right, Nick. Do you want your little

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,559
Pride Month gift or what? Pride month

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,719
gift. Of course, it's the month to

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,160
celebrate our gay brother. We're reusing

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,640
this basket. Not the panty basket again.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,680
The picnic basket. What's in here? Is it

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,640
going to bite me? No. Oh my god.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,320
Gamer. Gamer.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,360
gamer shirt. Matt, isn't that cool? Oh

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,960
my god. Is that not so cool? It's

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,720
definitely not. Go ahead. Next one. I'm

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,680
so scared. Look.

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,920
Sorry, girls. I like bananas. Oh my god.

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,040
Is it not perfect?

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
I don't think. Put it on. No. Absolutely

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
not. No, I'm not wearing that. Smells

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
like some high-end gays live here. Does

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
it smell good? I don't know. I haven't

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,960
sniffed it.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:39,439
No. Rupaul Mad Libs. Mhm. Last thing.

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,439
Brokeback Mountain

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,159
little book. This is so cool. Matt,

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,799
right? What is this? I don't know. I saw

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,560
it. I love it. Wait, can I tell them

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
about today's sponsor of the video?

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
Sure. Are you like me, Matt, and Chris,

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
needing to get out of the house, wanting

42

All right, Nick. What is the first thing

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,440
that First thing we're doing? I want new

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
shoes and I want them today and now. So

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,840
if they have my size, we're going to buy

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,440
them from where we're going to take you

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
to pay less. We're not going to buy

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
them. You guys are gonna love them. I

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
forgot. I slipped my mind. Like they're

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,480
very similar to these boots I have on,

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
but they're like slightly different and

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
I want them. So, we're going to go buy

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
you boots that are slightly different

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,519
from a $2,000 pair of boots that you

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
already own and just use mine and hers

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,280
as mine. Wow. You pieced it together

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
quick.

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,159
We all saw this coming, didn't we? Like

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,159
a moth to a flame. Salt. Yeah.

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:28,720
We all knew he was going to stop, right?

87

[Music]

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,239
Should I do the worm? Yeah. I almost

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,000
broke my wrist. Nick, what are you

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
doing? Look, I got my There's a full

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,319
watch indent on my wrist. What are you

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,599
doing? I almost just broke my wrist.

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
You're going to start Now there's a car

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,720
coming. I'm going to kill myself. You're

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,799
going to start getting Nick can't even

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,480
film. What? That guy was hot. Hi. Nick

97
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
can't even film a sick montage cuz he's

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,239
too busy being a living. No, I can't do

99
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,959
it. Well, show them off. Show them off.

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,040
And they got like the big new buckles.

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,680
No, they're fire. Can we watch Brokeback

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,840
Mountain or No.

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm down.

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
I really love this movie. It's a really

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,040
heartbreaking gay story, but it's like

106
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
it's an important piece of gay history.

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,640
I just can't imagine that people are

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
homophobic. Like I think homophobia and

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
like worrying about people being gay is

110
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,199
like really [ __ ] gay. It's crazy cuz

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
sometimes homophobic people get like

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
they get super worked up and angry when

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,199
no one even said some gay [ __ ] Like

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,880
sorry you're thinking about

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
and that's why you're like spiraling out

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,290
of control. You know what I mean?

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,740
Popcorn ain't going to last.

[Music]

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,479
Up again. The most painful story.

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,520
You're going to broke back mountain.

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
Even if you're going to Big Back

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,280
Mountain, huh? Know that's all right.

123
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,440
Watch yourself, brother. Your wife's

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,440
right there.

He was only 39 years old.

127
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
Hello.

128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
Aren't you so happy to have a gay

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
brother?

130
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,520
Mhm. That movie's so good. I feel like

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,080
every single time I watch it, I might as

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,080
well just stab myself in the face. Yeah.

133
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
It's like an equivalent feeling. It's

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,199
really, really sad. Equivalent. You mean

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,560
equivalent, right? Like after all the

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
gay people go through, you want to

137
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
correct how I say a word, after all the

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
things I experienced emotionally in my

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
life. You should pin that back of your

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
hair down. It looks a little silly. It

141
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,759
is crazy like what people had to go

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
through. It's so sad. It is. It's

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,880
devastating. All right, that was movie

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
night for Nick's Yes Day. I don't know

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
why I just decided to torture us. That

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,960
was a really good movie. It's a great

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,320
movie, but it's like emotional torture.

148
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,440
I can't believe I've never seen it. I'm

149
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,440
happy I watched it. So good.

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,479
Lamar Jackson, get ready. Receiving the

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,440
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll

152
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
let you know if I have any more

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,240
questions. I appreciate you. This This

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,000
kid hates AI, by the way. I do.

155
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,039
No worries at all. I'm I'm always happy

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,600
to help, whether you love AI or not. Oh

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,240
my Whoa. You're paying a little bit too

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,639
close of attention. That kind of scared

159
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
you that you heard him.

160
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,080
Oh, I'm sorry if that caught you off

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
guard. I just tried to be attentive. All

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,560
right, I'm going to listen to music.

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,560
Talk to you later.

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,160
There's a prize for judgment. All right,

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,520
I have an idea.

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
We're going to go watch the sunset at

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,240
the beach and we're also going to do

168
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,240
yoga cuz I want to be more tranquil

169
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,560
tranquil and peaceful. So, I think we

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,680
should do a yoga class.

171
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:06,880
You can hear the waves crashing already.

172
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:09,520
Ah, it might rain. Rain, rain, go away.

173
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,280
Dude, you're weird. Imagine living on

174
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,280
like a beachfront. Gorgeous. Sorry, I'll

175
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,840
take a walk.

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
Imagine living on a beachfront gorgeous

177
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,440
home and it's the ugliest one in the

178
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,639
vlog.

179
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Watch out.

180
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,560
The Green Brothers are back. The boys

181
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
are back. It doesn't even look like

182
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,319
you're wearing green. It looks like

183
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
brown. Bro, people see this hoodie and

184
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,039
they're always like, "Chris loves that

185
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,639
hoodie." And they think it's like my

186
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,560
gray one that I wear. I think whenever

187
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
someone talks about the quantity of

188
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,080
which someone's wearing something, they

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,840
need to stop talking. Okay. Well, it's

190
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,120
like I'm wearing it. Like I'm I'm I wear

191
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
the [ __ ] out of my clothes. Like if I

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
like it, I'm going to wear the [ __ ] out

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
of it cuz I like it. I thought for some

194
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,560
reason the sand was going to be freezing

195
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
cold, but it's kind of not. Is it not?

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
It's not at all. I don't know why you're

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
wearing Timberland boots. I don't like

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
touching I don't like sand touching my

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,000
skin. I like get freaked out by it. We

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
should have brought chips. We should

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,039
have brought Lays chips. [ __ ] Dude, we

202
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
should have stopped at Jersey Mike and

203
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,280
got BLTs. Let Mike have his way with our

204
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,360
sandwiches. Let Mike [ __ ] it. Let Mike

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
do his thing.

206
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
I don't know. I think we should just

207
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,120
like enjoy the moment. I'm down to enjoy

208
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,879
the moment. Let's do something fun. I

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,479
agree. What? You're going to get sand on

210
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,039
you. Are you serious? Yes.

211
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,199
Oh my god.

212
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,840
Again. How the [ __ ] did you do that

213
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,680
again? Come here. No. Yes. Dude, that

214
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
like hurt my hand. Come here. You have

215
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,959
my balls. No, I didn't. I know where

216
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,959
your balls are.

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,039
That was so fun.

218
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,760
All right, so Matt's turn. Matt, your

219
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,600
turn. No hands, though. No hands. I

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,080
don't think we can do it just like No,

221
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,080
we can try it.

222
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,519
Yo, Matt, that's kind of impressive.

223
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,760
Really? It's all Nick, you should flip

224
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,240
them like in circles. No. Should I back

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,800
flip right now? What?

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:11,760
Yo, there's sand in my shirt up here.

227
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,519
Do that. Obviously, bro.

228
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,000
What's other fun yoga moves you could

229
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,800
try? Downward dog and [ __ ] like this.

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,040
Yeah, do that next to him. Matt, do it.

231
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
Do it. No, you do it. What's the word?

232
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
What's a good like yoga move? I don't

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,480
know. They're standing in my mouth, on

234
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,360
my face, and in my butt when I have

235
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,959
moisturizer on. So it's like kind of

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,959
like primer like like sticking to my

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,399
face. Okay. What do you want to do? I

238
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,399
like shit's sticking to All right. I

239
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,399
know.

240
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
Stop. Do you think there's a life guard

241
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
on the lifeguard tower or a life guard

242
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,160
in the life guard tower? Do you think

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,160
there's one? I don't know. I really

244
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,000
like God. You guys should have like

245
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
definitely got me a date for this video.

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
You should have asked. You didn't ask.

247
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
Yeah. You wouldn't have found anyone

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,160
anyway. Yeah. It's hard. It's an

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,320
impossible task. Find Nick a date.

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,120
World's not true. I have to I need more

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,839
god, guys.

253
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,839
I'm not that good.

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,079
Stop laughing at me. Good. Stop. Okay,

255
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
dude. I just got flashbacks to when we

256
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,320
were like 11 years old. Dude, what is

257
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,399
this? What is this?

258
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,640
I was going to pull your pants down. Yo,

259
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:41,680
what the [ __ ] was that? Nick.

260
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,560
Holy [ __ ] Nick. No. No.

261
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,519
Get away. Nick, stop. I'll smack the

262
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,240
[ __ ] out of you. No. Dude, beach patrol

263
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,160
is going to come over. The beach patrol.

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
Nick, it is really freaking me out that

265
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,360
you're like moving your feet around like

266
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:01,519
that. Look at him. Like it just freaks

267
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,160
me out cuz I wait Nick. Oh my god.

268
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,600
My I was like I got taken a back cuz I

269
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
saw his penis on the ground. You want to

270
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,959
know what I realized? You almost got hit

271
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
by a bike earlier. These are only for

272
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,760
bikes and people are supposed to walk up

273
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,040
there. So we're like rollerblades.

274
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,200
She's good. Let's go. Come on. Yeah. She

275
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,720
would have smoked.

276
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,560
It happened to me once. I got hit by a

277
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,760
bike except I was walking in a straight

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,240
line for 30 minutes and then he hit me.

279
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,480
Like what the [ __ ] I'm literally tired

280
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,800
like in my back.

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Really? Yes. It's our ball. It's our

282
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,160
ball. Z carry me. Yes. Wait, I forgot

283
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,160
you guys have to say yes. Just try.

284
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Okay.

285
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,440
Okay. I don't think this has ever

286
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
happened in my life. My butt cracks kind

287
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,800
of out.

288
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,399
Hello. Sorry. Get back. Get back cuz

289
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,360

291
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
We're going to get chips. We're going to

292
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,720
get chips. Let's go get chips. Fix your

293
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,320
hair and resay that.

294
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,959
Oh. Oh my god. I almost got our car door

295
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
taken out. Seven more cars. Go chips.

296
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
Chips. Nick. Nick, there's more cars

297
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,880
coming. I want chips. I'll tell you when

298
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,880
you can open the door.

299
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,360
He just doesn't. Oh my god. Hey guys,

300
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
what's up? You know where it's Nick's

301
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,920
guess what month? Two weeks. How long

302
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,079
has it been? It's a month, Matt. Pride

303
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,680
month. Sorry, forgot. Um,

304
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,800
we're going to get him a cake because

305
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
he's out with friends right now. And

306
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
we're going to surprise him with a

307
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,880
little sweet treat when he gets home cuz

308
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,360
we know he'll love it. I'm not baking

309
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
him a cake. You're not? No. Like, I'll

310
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
buy him a storebought one, but I'm not

311
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,120
baking him. I thought the whole point

312
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,480
was like to bake a cake. We can frost

313
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,320
it. I'm not baking it. Okay. I feel like

314
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,000
let's try to bake him a cake and then we

315
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,720
can use like something like this like

316
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,279
and he'll No, no, no, no, no. Oh, Matt,

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,040
what? Oh my god. Oh my god. No way.

318
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,440
Wait, this just made our life so much

319
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,760
easier. That was easy as [ __ ] And he

320
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,000
doesn't he like chocolate cake? I don't

321
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
know. I think he does. Where's like a

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
chocolate cake? I feel like he likes all

323
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
types of cake. Should I get him like

324
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,760
this? That's That's giving like gay,

325
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
right? Yeah. And we can like type on it.

326
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we can go to

327
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
the aisle instead of like a little end

328
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
cap over here. This is per What's the

329
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
difference? Are you judging it based on

330
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
where it was found? No. I just think of

331
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,839
fruit. I think we can find more options.

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,800
I think we go Chris. We can find better

333
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,560
options. We don't need better. But we

334
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,639
can get like a Chris. That's the worst

335
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,320
thing. Eating icing pink tastes

336
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,160
delicious. That's the worst thing. We

337
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,000
don't need pink. What is it? Is he

338
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,760
having a girl? Like let's not No, he

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
just loves this. Okay. No, I think we

340
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,839
find like an actual good color. You're

341
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,200
saying this is a bad color? No, I'm not

342
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,040
saying it's a bad color. I'm saying that

343
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,480
we can do better than this. You just

344
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
like don't even want to put effort. I'm

345
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,399
buying this. Chris, let's go. Chris,

346
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
let's probably get him a hat, right?

347
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,639
We're here for a cake. We're not going

348
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,639
to He'll love that.

349
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,760
Should we get him the hat? I don't think

350
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,079
we need to get him a sun hat. All right,

351
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,279
let's keep going. What about flowers?

352
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,000
No. No. No. You don't think he'll love

353
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,320
flowers? No. You know, men only get

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,880
flowers at their funeral. Damn, that's

355
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,519
deep. Come on. Wow, that's actually

356
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,360
really deep. I've heard seen that like a

357
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,180
million times. I feel like you can get

358
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,290
deeper there.

359
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,290
[Music]

360
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,680
Matt, I'm fine with this one. No. Why?

361
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,160
Cuz like, dude, you want to bake them a

362
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,680
cake? No, we could do Look at Look at

363
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,760
all the other options. You can just get

364
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,519
this better and you just don't get that

365
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,880
but smaller decorating gel.

366
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,040
See, but now we can get like the letters

367
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,279
like we can spell like easier to type

368
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,279
with.

369
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,279
You think that's easier to type with?

370
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
100%. Oh my god. Let's get him a party

371
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,880
popper candle, Chris. Yeah. Yeah. That's

372
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
the type of [ __ ] I'm on. Yeah. Yeah.

373
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,279
Yeah. Do you want to carry something?

374
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Yeah, I do. But I'm also recording.

375
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,000
Get that. Okay. What is that? The thing

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,639
with a million wicks in it. Grab it,

377
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Matt. Okay.

378
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,760
What is that? Yeah. Incredible candle.

379
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,079
Oh, it opens. Yeah, but it says happy

380
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,480
birthday on the inside. That's fine. No,

381
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,959
he'll love the idea.

382
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
Oh, wait. Chris, he'll love this. What's

383
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,440
that? A n like nautical theme. I don't

384
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,040
know what that has to do with pride, but

385
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,800
let's just make it like like the crab

386
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
looks cute. We should make them [ __ ]

387
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,880
like we'll make that crab [ __ ] the other

388
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
crab. Chris, I don't even like hearing

389
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,800
that. I feel like we can ditch the

390
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,399
single slice cake. I kind of agree.

391
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah. Can you go put it back? I will put

392
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,600
it back, but let's figure out what else

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,600
we need. I just looked at this decorate.

394
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,079
One.

395
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,079
Matt just looked at this sheet of A

396
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,680
through Z letters and goes, "Will this

397
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,079
spell pride?" And he's like trying to

398
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,839
find all the letters. It's al it's an

399
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
alphabet. Okay, let's just get a bunch

400
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,560
of rainbow sprinkles to like top it off

401
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,560
and then we'll be done. Okay, bye.

402
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,720
Are you home yet?

403
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,839
Am I home yet? Yes. I think that's the

404
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,839
question for you.

407
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,680
Where? To my room.

408
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,880
Yes. What's going on? Me and Matt just

409
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,440

410
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880

411
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,959

I knew that was a bad idea.

480

We have to go bury that somewhere. Run

481
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,880
