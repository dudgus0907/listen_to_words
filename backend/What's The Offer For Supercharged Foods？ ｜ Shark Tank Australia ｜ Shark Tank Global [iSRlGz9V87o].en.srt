00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Hi everyone. My name's Lee Holmes and

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,600
I'm the founder of Supercharged

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:20,199
Food. I'm looking for

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,560
$200,000 for 20% of my

6
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,640
business. Supercharged Food started

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,039
about 5 years ago after a struggle that

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,199
I had with my own health.

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,160
I woke up one day and I literally could

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,480
not get out of bed. I had hives covering

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,120
my whole body. My hair was falling out

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,360
in clumps around me. I went through what

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
I found to be a very complex medical

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
system. Doctor to doctor, scan to scan,

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,079
more clumps of hair, and I was put on a

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,039
concoction of drugs, immunosuppressants,

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,920
anti-inflammatories, steroids that blew

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,160
me up like the Michelin man. From there,

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
I looked to food for answers. I created

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,199
recipes and I put them up on my blog,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,199
Supercharged

22
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,039
Food. The blog became really popular.

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,680
Everyone loved the delicious recipes and

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,240
I wrote my very first book, Eat Your Way

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
to Good

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,920
Health. And it became an international

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,760
number one bestseller. I've since

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,159
written four bestselling

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,640
books. One of the main new parts of my

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,680
Supercharged Food website is my online

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,799
4-week heal your gut program. It's based

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,360
on my latest book, Heal Your

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,960
Gut. It's put together with a team of

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,360
experts. People do the program online.

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
They get recipes in their inbox, and the

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,479
testimonials have been so outstanding

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,320
and fantastic.

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,920
We've also got some supercharged food.

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,840
Would you like to give it a try? Sure.

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,520
Absolutely.

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,960
So, Lee, that was $200,000 for 20%. So,

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,840
you're valuing your business at $1

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,680
million. Yes, that's correct. Thank you.

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
So that's the mint chop chip smoothie

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
that you're having, Naomi. Looks

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
fantastic. It's dairy free, sugar free,

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,360
wheat free, gluten-free, everything

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
free, as my daughter would say. So yeah,

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,479
what am I eating? That is a vanilla

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
custard with gelatin, which is really

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,360
good for the gut. Right. What am I left

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,879
with? You're left with a beautiful

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,879
salmon chowder, I think. And there's

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
also some pesto and some beautiful

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,200
lemony herb crackers. Cracking the

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,200
pesto. This is yummy.

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,520
So what is your business? So, the

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
business is my online website, the

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
digital platform. I have an online

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,720
store. It's my program, my four-week

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
program, as well as subsequent programs

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
that I'm putting together. There's a

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,040
2-day maintenance program, and it's also

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,800
ebooks. Can you just run me through your

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,680
income streams and the revenues you get

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,200
from each? So, my books, um, I've sold

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,879
120,000 units, so I get income from

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,920
them. But the books are not

69
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,800
included because I already have a

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,879
contract with my publisher. But what is

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,680
included is my program, subsequent

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,080
programs, the products, the store, the

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,599
online store. The online store has sold

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,280
$65,000 worth of products in the last 12

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,480
months and the program has made about

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,159
$94,800. I really like your business

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,319
model. I think it's fantastic. Thank

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,400
you. The thing is though, it is all

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
about you.

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
It's your reputation. I think you've

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,680
done an amazing job on selling 120,000

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,599
books which build your audience. But the

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,760
challenge for us is that it is all about

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,599
you. So, had you thought about that?

85
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
I have thought about that. The great

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
thing about it is we we've got the

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,640
digital platform. We've got the

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
audience. You can run weight loss

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
programs through it. You can run all

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
different programs through it. You've

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,599
got it there. It's ready to go. It's an

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
amazing structure. Could you train

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,280
someone else to run those programs? Oh,

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,599
yes. Yeah, definitely. You can get a

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959
community manager. I'm just the face.

96
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,720
Good day, Eli. I haven't said much of

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
you, Steve. How you doing, Steve? Um,

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,799
where are you from? I'm from England

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,519
originally. And yesterday, where were

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,840
you from? Oh, Bondi. Bondi, Sydney.

101
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,360
Um, I don't believe the whole the whole

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
superfood thing and stuff just drives me

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
insane. I think that uh my my first

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
reaction is, can I please have some

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,879
bacon with it?

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
[Music]

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,360
So, um I'm not a natural for this uh

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,199
this segment.

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,199
So, I'll I'll bow out. Okay. Thank you.

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,360
Steve's out. Four of us

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,880
in. My concern is you've just excluded

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,919
probably the best part of your business,

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
which are your

114
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,759
books. I I recognize your

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,840
[Music]

116
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,840
books. Um, I'm out. Thank you.

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,759
Your business is very bankable. You've

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,600
got cash flow. You're you're the

119
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,199
brand. Frankly, you are the unre

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,040
repeatable miracle of your business,

121
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,680
which is a risk from an investment point

122
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,120
of

123
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,440
view. I wish you

124
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,440
well. I'm out.

125
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Look, I I've got to be creative in my

126
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,800
deal to be able to do a deal because

127
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,800
it's it's the valuation is is very

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,880
difficult to get to. Yeah.

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
So, the offer I've got for you is

130
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,560
200,000. I'm splitting it in half. So,

131
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,600
the first 100,000 will be repaid to me

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,960
uh by $10 every time someone comes in

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,960
and does a program.

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
The reason there's no interest on it is

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,919
because it's paid within 24 months. So

136
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,199
it's basically interest free. Yeah.

137
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,520
Okay. And the other 100,000 I will uh

138
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,440
buy as equity. So I'll buy shares full

139
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,880
fully

140
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,880
shares but I want 35% of the business.

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,889
Thank you.

142
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,889
[Music]

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,759
I'm going to make you an

144
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,880
offer, but I actually think you need a

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,319
business partner. I think you need

146
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,520
somebody who's going to run your

147
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,600
operation for you. So, I'm prepared to

148
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,639
put a business manager into your

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,319
business. Mhm. Are you going to fund it?

150
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah. Who's funding that? It It has to

151
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,039
be funded by the business. A reasonable

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
salary, not a big salary, what usually.

153
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
So, you're prepared to have her pay for

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
your business manager, but she'll

155
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
provide the expertise. It's okay. It's

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,479
pretty generous. That's okay. I I think

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,479
this corner need is right. She needs a

158
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,560
business partner. That corner is a lone

159
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,560
shark.

160
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
No, she doesn't. How's that a lone

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
shark? It's $100,000 interest free.

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
There's no lone sharking at all. They're

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
not even letting me give you an offer.

164
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,080
They're so selfish, aren't they? It's

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,160
all about them. We're here for you. It's

166
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
all about them. You pay for my business

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
manager, but it's all about them. Oh,

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,639
please know me. Actions speak louder

169
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,440
than words, mate. Lee, I want 50% of

170
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,440
your business for 200,000.

171
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,680
But you get a business manager.

172
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,769
[Music]

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Okay. Okay. What are you going to do?

174
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,039
Thank you, Naomi, so much for your

175
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,759
offer. Because it's 50% I feel like I,

176
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,510
you know, it's half of my company. Um,

177
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,240
so I'm a bit overwhelmed by

178
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,240
[Music]

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,479
that. Janine, you are the biggest

180
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000

already a brand, so now you got to

191
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
build. She's a great business partner.

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,360
Well done. Thank you, Lee. We'll see you

193
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,759
out there. Oh, Lee, was there anything

194
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,720
you didn't like about her? No. Oh, okay.

195
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,440
Just checking.

196
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,440
You haven't met her yet.

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,399
I I want someone to say that about me

198
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
once. Just once. So, what are you

199
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
looking forward to the most? Working

200
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
with Janine and getting to know her a

201
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,120
little bit better and taking the

202
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,120
business to the next level. How lucky am

203
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
I?
