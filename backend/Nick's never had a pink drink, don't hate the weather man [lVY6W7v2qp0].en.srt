142
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,560
like Matthew but like how is Richard

143
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,199
shortened to

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,199

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,639
William like are you for real like I

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,280
don't get that and then Bob is Rob Rob

147
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,560
and Bob is the same name like Bobby and

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,840
Robert Robert and

149
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Bob wait what you just said like four

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,960
different names all the same Bob Rob

151
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,039
Bobby Robert all them no way all four

152
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,720
I've never seen it's both names then

153
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,360
it's them both shorten like Bobby and

154
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,840
Robert and then if you shorten Robert

155
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,440
you get Rob and if you shorten Bobby you

156
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,759
get Bob so it's Bobby Robert Bob and Bob

157
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,400
Rob and it's the same thing naming land

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,560
and naming animals when they're first

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,560
discovered like who's just like [ __ ] it

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,680
North

161
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,199
America well like it's kind of just like

162
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,720
if you found something you make it the

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,360
name of you okay like if I were to find

164
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,160
an island I'd be like oh Christopher's

165
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,680
Island and then boom it's so how did we

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,400
get Massachusetts someone was probably

167
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,800
like Paul moch chuso or some [ __ ] like

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,400
that and then he landed there and he was

169
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,360
like I deem this like

170
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,759
Massachusetts boom cuz

171
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,720
Connecticut Steve

172
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,960
kuta you're just making [ __ ] up setting

173
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,080
clocks backwards or forwards I have this

174
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,560
written down too like why are we doing

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,319
that what's the point it's because of

176
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,800
time zone CH yeah but if you put it

177
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,199
forward if you put it forward and then 6

178
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,520
months later you're putting it back to

179
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,319
where it I what if we just never altered

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,000
it that's what I'm trying to the days

181
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,440
become night and the night become day

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,319
see I don't know and also another thing

183
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,560
I wrot down I don't get how like you're

184
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,160
not it's not like you're putting it

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:17,199
Forward two times in a row it's always

186
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,879
forward then back forward forward back

187
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,960
so it's the same so it's like why are we

188
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,319
doing like the whole hour switch for no

189
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,639
reason if it's I bet you some [ __ ] with

190
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,840
the government to distract us maybe they

191
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,120
use that day to do something else crazy

192
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,400
because they know everyone's going to be

193
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,680
focused on the time zone change

194
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,000
or maybe they need more time in the

195
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,160
winter to prepare for something evil so

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,160
they want it to be darker sooner so then

197
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,000
by like 5:30 it's dark and then that's

198
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,720
when people start looming cuz they're

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,960
like oh now we have our evil night like

200
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,680
oh my God you know what I mean I feel

201
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,240
like you got a bigger plan than every

202
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,400
yeah I feel like honest God you might be

203
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,280
actually on to something new I feel like

204
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,400
what if one day we all

205
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,919

206
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,879
get Chris what predicting the weather

207
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,360
the weather you're telling me the

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,840
weatherman knows it's raining in a week

209
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,319
and a half it's not the weatherman it's

210
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,400
stats he's just the communicator don't

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840

everyone's like [ __ ] you weatherman but

216
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,400
he just got the stats I don't think

217
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:17,080
anyone's everever been mad at the

218
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,639
weatherman himself I've definitely been

219
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,280
mad at the weatherman but then I think

220
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,400
you hear the weather like oh blizzard

221
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,479
this week well it's just we just have to

222
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
separate him from the facts like we know

223
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,960
it's not the weatherman telling us the

224
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,960
weather okay he needs like a looser

225
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,839

us to listen like you're the weather man

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,600
like you need something like the like no

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,839

233
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,440
and oh wear a rain coat tomorrow don't

234
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,200

GPS and and etas one don't I [ __ ]

290
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,240
hate like more than anything what when I

291
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
look at the ETA and like you're in

292
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,000
traffic and the whole point of the ETA

293
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,519
is supposed to be like oh you get there

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,240
like this is the amount of time till

295
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,800
you're at that destination and you're

296
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,279
looking at the ETA and then it's like as

297
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
you're driving and you're in traffic it

298
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,720
like keeps going up a minute it's like

299
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,320
you're not doing your [ __ ] job at all

300
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,680
yeah like figure out what the traffic

301
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,880
ahead of me that's what I'm saying yeah

302
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,560
so it's like that like why well it is e

303
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,079
is estimated time of arrival so it's not

304
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,120

305
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,519

313
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,160
and a PTA like oh this was your ETA but

314
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,320

316
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,920

364
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,160

[ __ ] and everywhere like you're you're

373
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,079
absolutely just trashing a bathroom

374
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,440
you're the worst just like I don't know

375
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,839
how they don't get caught like how do

376
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,759
you not walk into someone just like

377
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,720
throwing their [ __ ] W other students the

378
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,240
teachers have their own bathroom so I if

379
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,880
I walk into a bathroom and some kid

380
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,880
throwing the [ __ ] at the wall I got

381
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,199
other things my dream bathroom scenario

382
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
everywhere in the world would be just

383
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,600
like 10 individual person no bathrooms

384
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,279
for any I agree ful I fully agree but

385
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
the plumbing just can't probably keep up

386
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,680
with that I definitely could it's just

387
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,079
like 10

388
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,920
toilets I don't understand I also don't

389
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,120
understand why urals were made for like

390
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,399
the boy's bathroom it's like we can pee

391
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,040
in a in a stall you know what I mean

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,000
butal Journal only you can only pee in

393
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,880
it's like why are we creating a less

394
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,120
useful device than the one that's

395
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,160
already there that I I think it's

396
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
water like you don't have to fill up a

397
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,839
Ural full of water it like saves water

398
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,399
well I don't understand it's like food

399
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,959
and baking and how like everything has

400
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,800
an individual taste but we're just going

401
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,920

451
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,120
seasoning in my life like I don't think

453
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,480
seasoned meal but

454
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,600
regardless ingredients shock me to my

455
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,000
core I agree especially like different

456
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,079

go to this restaurant you like things

459
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,199
that like shouldn't be together and then

460
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,319
it goes together so well and it's like

461
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,760

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,320
ingredient he made like the pink drink

557
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,919
and then people liked it so much and he

558
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,440
was blowing up on YouTube that all the

559
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:41,799

560
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,240
