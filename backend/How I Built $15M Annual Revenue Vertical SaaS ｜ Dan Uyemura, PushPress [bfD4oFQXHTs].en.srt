1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,679
first time Founders like you just don't

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,839
know we we didn't have to pitch so it

3
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,200
was like we're stammering fumbling over

4
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,759
slides like we didn't know how to

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,160
actually present the opportunity and

6
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,639
package it the second one is like we

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,920
just didn't understand what VCS were

8
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,080
looking for like I legit thought Venture

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,640
Capital people were gamblers like I

10
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,840
thought that there was here's 5 million

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
go see what you can do you know I just

12
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,480
thought they were just gamblers and then

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,920
it took us many many pitches for us to

14
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,359
realize like oh they actually want to

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,760
see like there's a business here and

16
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,320
there's you have to understand your Tam

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,640
and what does the growth potential look

18
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,640
like all these things I mean the bottom

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,080
line is this it's like if you're

20
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,680
building something that everyone

21
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,079
recognizes a value in there's really no

22
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,600
value in it because everyone's probably

23
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,040
doing it if you really believe that

24
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,079
there's something valuable and nobody

25
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,840
else can see it and the gamble is like

26
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,239
are you wrong are you crazy right and

27
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,120
that's what we had to reflect on but if

28
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,800
you're not wrong there actually is a lot

29
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,480
of value there because if because no one

30
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,079
else is doing it right and that is what

31
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,280
value is so especially as a young

32
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,719
founder you're like am I crazy like is

33
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,719
there really no no way we can beat Mind

34
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,960
Body here is this like it's so clear to

35
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,039
me but no one else can see it and you

36
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
want to believe that these people are

37
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,280
smarter than you they probably are right

38
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,760
but they just don't understand your

39
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,960
business or the opportunity and the

40
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
thing I didn't realize at the time is

41
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,280
like in one hour they're trying to

42
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,320
understand what you spent 5 years doing

43
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,320
right and you think about it every day

44
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,000
for 5 years and they're trying to get in

45
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,320
one hour and there's just no way they

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,880
can right part of that's on me or the

47
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,680
founder because if you can't relay all

48
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
that information in an hour that's on

49
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,439
you but at the same time as a first-

50
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,600
Time founder it's like it it takes a lot

51
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,840
of reps to get to the point where you

52
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,320
can explain it and you're going to get

53
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,320
told no for every single rep that you're

54
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,960
building that ability right and that's

55
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,000
okay it really is okay but let it be a

56
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,920
chip on your shoulder because that'll

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
that'll fire you up more yeah

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840

be exciting conversation we're about to

66

have so my name is Dan we Mora I am the

67
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,680
CEO and a co-founder of push press we

68
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,280
are a gym management software platform

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,320
uh and really it's like our job to help

70
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,000
a gym owner focus on the one thing that

71
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
they really care about which is their

72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
clients and helping their clients get

73
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
Fitness and strip away all the other

74
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,879
complexities of business through our

75
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,800
software platform and when did you start

76
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,920
the company oh so we had the idea in

77
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
about 2011 um started writing code

78
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,959
around 2011 it took us about 2 years to

79
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
get enough code written to have the

80
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,480
first client which was my gym on boarded

81
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,360
2013 so about 11 years ago well I guess

82
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,239
you have to predate the gym ownership I

83
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,440
was an engineer I spent about 10 years

84
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,840
writing code and building stuff so you

85
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,760
know Builders always look at things from

86
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
the lens of like how was this built I

87
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,000
open the gym I looked at the software

88
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
that was available and I could tell

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,599
pretty clearly like this was built a

90
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,840
long time ago Andor I don't know it just

91
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,239
wasn't up to like modern standards now

92
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,800
that I've built it all I can realize

93
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
it's it takes forever to build this much

94
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,280
software so I get it now why it wasn't

95
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
but at the time I was like there's no

96
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
way I can use this software so for the

97
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
first gym we just kind of rolled our own

98
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,959
just piece Meed some stuff together on

99
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
WordPress and then kind of from there

100
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,920
there was just like this organic

101
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,319
Inquisition from my peers who are gym

102
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,120
owners of like what are you using how

103
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,360
can I use that type stuff that kind of

104
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,040
like lit the light bulb of like we

105
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,560
really should do this so you open the

106
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,280
gym what year was this again the gym

107
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,400
itself the gym opened in 2010 2010 okay

108
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,360
and why did you decide to open the gym I

109
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,959
had been coding for about a decade maybe

110
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,440
a little bit more I didn't really

111
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,319
realize it at the time but when you're

112
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
an engineer well now it's like there's

113
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,040
High leverage with coders right and

114
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,560
obviously my bosses knew this so it was

115
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,319
like they would put dinners in front of

116
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
me Italian dinner they put Coca-Cola and

117
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,480
coffee in front of me and i' just be

118
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,439
coating all day and in that 10e span I

119
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,080
probably put on like 30 lbs I got I was

120
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,879
getting a separation from a marriage at

121
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,840
the time and you know that's when you

122
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,400
actually look at yourself in the mirror

123
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,920
and go oh I'm single I'm going to have

124
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,040
to go on a date and I'm a slob so I uh I

125
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,080
I started I and and I guess I didn't

126
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,200
really know about this about myself at

127
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,480
the time but entrepreneurs are generally

128
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,319
obsessive compulsive I believe and so I

129
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,720
basically went for the fastest thing

130
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,239
that can get me the most results which

131
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
put me pretty much in a direct path

132
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,519
right into CrossFit and I fell in love

133
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,599
with it became like a RAB rabid CrossFit

134
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,560
fanatic helped people open gyms got my

135
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,040
coach's certification and then I got

136
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,159
laid off at Myspace and just said I'm

137
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
going to take this money and go open a

138
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,239
gym give it a shot I was tired of coding

139
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,239
I guess you know it was it was in a in a

140
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,959
time when the industry itself was trying

141
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,040
to figure itself out so everything was

142
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
uh you know fast-paced but also very

143
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,919
under optimized and so when you opened

144
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,720
your own gym did you do anything

145
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,280
differently like how did you organize

146
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
the gym what was different about your

147
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,800
gym so and again so in during this time

148
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
this is when it was like I don't know if

149
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,440
you know much about CrossFit culture but

150
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
back then it was like pukey the clown

151
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,080
and dudes with their shirt off and just

152
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,919
like crazy masculine toxic masculinity

153
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,240
type stuff which you know is is the

154
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
brand but we we actually opened our gym

155
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
thinking like we want to tailor to

156
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,400
40-year-olds who are brand aesthetic

157
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,039
appeal you know like who appeal to a

158
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,919
brand aesthetic we picked colors that

159
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,360
were non- shocking and and so our whole

160
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,880
brand was was more around inclusivity

161
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
and for for everybody when we opened it

162
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,120
that was kind of you know I was older at

163
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,160
the time I was probably 30 33 or

164
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
something which was you know back then

165
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,120
CrossFit was like a 20-year- old thing

166
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,199
so we were trying to get it to be uh

167
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,120
more

168
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,919
inclusive I I look for software

169
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
immediately I think with most founding

170
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,479
stories there's a lot of things that

171
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,039
lead up to it right and so one of the

172
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,759
things I led up to it was and this is

173
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,440
when I was still at Myspace I was like

174
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,560
spending a solid hour a day negotiating

175
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
our payments rate for this gym we're

176
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,880
going to open with the payments company

177
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
and man they put me through the ringer

178
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,759
it was like fact in stuff give me

179
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
supporting documents dating back for 10

180
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,720
like all of this stuff that I had to do

181
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,080
I was a really bad employee but I even

182
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,080
remember feeling guilty like I'm

183
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,560
spending so much time faxing stuff doing

184
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,080
things to make this payments thing

185
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,479
happen it was just ridiculous and

186
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,039
anyways I I negotiated all the way down

187
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,199
to 1.9% and Brian was a worked at a bank

188
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
and he came in and he's like it's

189
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,479
impossible you're not paying 1.9 he told

190
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,160
me to give me I gave him his my our bank

191
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,360
statements he looked he looked over it

192
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,400
brought it home came back next day he's

193
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,000
like you're paying 4.8 and so I was so

194
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,960
pissed off that like I spent spent a a

195
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,160
month of my time trying to negotiate

196
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,199
this right down I got lied to and then

197
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,520
and then I had to find out because

198
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,680
someone else like fact checked it so

199
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,440
that was a reason because I was

200
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,599
connected to the software but I was I'm

201
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,919
a software guy so I was looking for

202
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,759
software immediately to run the business

203
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,880
yeah that's that's that's kind of the

204
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,840
Genesis of it yeah and what was the

205
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,400
issue with the existing tools you

206
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
mentioned they all looked old but like

207
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,680
what what was the Practical issue in

208
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,680
terms of using them for your specific

209
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,599
gym yeah so the the biggest issue was

210
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,000
every gym runs a little bit differently

211
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,800
and that's because in Fitness you have

212
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,479
CrossFit you have MMA you have karate

213
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,479
you have kids Fitness Sports training

214
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,479
just so many different things and when I

215
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,120
pulled up the existing software the form

216
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,120
field was like a mile long like every

217
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,720
page was like a mile long of options and

218
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,639
things that I had to like every form

219
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,199
you're like what does this mean what

220
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,880
does it do if what happens if I change

221
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,000
this what are the ramifications on you

222
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,800
know like where where do you think what

223
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,120
happens and that thought process just

224
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,240
blew me away like I can't manage this

225
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,800
and so practically speaking it was like

226
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,879
when one software tries to do two much

227
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,000
for everybody it ends up doing nothing

228
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,680
for anyone and this was granted um you

229
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,160
know I'll cut them slack they built this

230
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,720
before like the iPhone came out and I

231
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,400
think the Paradigm of the iPhone changed

232
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
everyone's mind because the iPhone can

233
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,560
do anything for everyone but they

234
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,080
compartmentalized everything into Apps

235
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,759
and it allows you to customize the phone

236
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,479
to your own experience what you want and

237
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,160
that's what I now expected because this

238
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,280
is post iPhone like I'm like why do I

239
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,479
have to have all this stuff I just want

240
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
what I want right and so I think the

241
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,360
iPhone changed the game for how we

242
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
approach software I believe in that way

243
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,360
m

244
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
you're scaling any Milestones that you

245
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,800
remember in those early days that you

246
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,479
were anchored on like oh I need to get

247
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,680
to 100 customers or 1 million of AR

248
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,840
whatever that is so the the one that

249
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,520
like we'll never I'll never forget it's

250
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,080
uh will from mucker a venture capital

251
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,039
firm so we're pitching all these VCS

252
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,000
early because I'm like this is going to

253
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,319
crush we get payments money like like

254
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,759
there was so much to this I'm like this

255
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,240
is there's no way this is going to fail

256
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,879
all the players suck like we understand

257
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,919
it blah blah blah and we got laughed out

258
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,960
of every Venture room for years and one

259
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,919
of them this guy guy named will from

260
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,360
mucker he told me he's like hey this is

261
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,560
a great idea uh why don't you come back

262
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,240
when you're at 10,000 Mr because then

263
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,199
we'll know you have escape velocity I

264
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,120
remember these terms exactly and so

265
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,199
right when we hit 10,000 I called him

266
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,720
he's like yeah come down show me what's

267
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,080
going on blah blah and I was like cool

268
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,440
and we we were excited cuz I'm like dude

269
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,440
he's going to invest cuz we did what he

270
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,680
said and he's like this is all cool why

271
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,960
don't you get come call me back when you

272
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,479
get to 100,000 Mr because then I'll know

273
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,120
that you escap like literally told me

274
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,560
the same thing again I'm like oh all

275
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,200
right and so we called him back at

276
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,159
100,000 and he's like we pass like we're

277
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,719
not interested and um I just remember

278
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
like we it gave us a clear line in the

279
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,519
say like okay we have to get 10,000 Mr

280
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
and we're going to we're going to call

281
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,600
him back but the the irony is he's

282
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,959
actually an investor now because he

283
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,279
heard that we were raising a kind of a a

284
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,519
safe through another another party one

285
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,000
of our connected friends it was another

286
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,920
fraternity brother of ours was investing

287
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,360
cuz he did he's done well in some stuff

288
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,440
and he's friends with him on the side

289
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,519
he's like hey will you should check out

290
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,040
this company he's like oh I know them

291
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,680
and and then will called me and he's

292
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,279
like okay it's time let's do this and

293
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm like oh now it's time that's funny

294
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,000
yeah so uh yeah if you're thinking about

295
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,120
getting investment money from from uh

296
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,519
Venture capitals they're not they they

297
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,600
uh you got to show them some social

298
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,760
proof first like they're not just

299
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
throwing money around like I thought

300
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,640
they

301
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,000
were uh when did will invest and what

302
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,920
was the scale at that time I think we're

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,360
at 1.4 million AR or maybe maybe 2

304
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,040
million probably around 2 million

305
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,640
it honestly was probably it was a really

306
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,480
good deal I'm sure this was like late

307
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,360
2020 so it like during Co we grew we had

308
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,040
built a free product and like we were

309
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,480
doing we were actually building brand

310
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,760
because we were the most authentic like

311
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,240
gym owner Centric uh company and we grew

312
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
quite a bit and it was like the signals

313
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,680
were good the social proof was good the

314
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
the numbers looked good um and but I

315
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
didn't know how to raise money and so

316
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
this uh anti- VC type company com fund

317
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,560
came to me and he's like hey I think I

318
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,760
can just get some LPS together and raise

319
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
some money but it's got to be at this

320
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,360
valuation and I was just kind of like if

321
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,360
I can do no work on this because I don't

322
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,959
believe you're going to raise it like I

323
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,720
had no belief like I'm like I'm going to

324
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,480
do no work on this you can have that

325
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,440
good valuation but I don't want to do

326
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,120
anything like you know and he's like

327
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,440
cool and he got heo he did it in a

328
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
weekend like got it all closed up and

329
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
that's when will heard of the circle so

330
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,800
anyway that first round uh we were at 2

331
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,480
million in AR roughly 2 million in ARR

332
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,959
and I think it was like at 11 million

333
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,360
valuation so it was like 5x at a time

334
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,279
when people were getting like 50x or

335
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,320
something so I just didn't think it

336
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,959
would happen wow yeah so you reflect on

337
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,000
the many con Sation you had with the

338
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,480
investors and a lot of them were just

339
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,399
not going well what do you think just

340
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,399
was missing like what what happened

341
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,160
super good question for firsttime

342
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,839
Founders like you just don't know and I

343
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,839
remember like so some of the early ones

344
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,680
we pitched so one the first thing is we

345
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,120
were playing rotating CEO so like for

346
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,000
the first pitches I think Chris was the

347
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,639
CEO and then Brian was CEO for a while

348
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,399
and then at towards the end like at the

349
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,720
2020 stage it was me but I remember them

350
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,240
coming out we would come out and they'd

351
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,040
be like we we don't see any passion and

352
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,600
I was like what like dude we are like we

353
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,360
are so passion like I I couldn't believe

354
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
it but really what it was was we didn't

355
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
know how to we we didn't how to pitch so

356
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,160
it was like we're stammering fumbling

357
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,800
over slides like we didn't know how to

358
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,680
actually present the opportunity and

359
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,320
package it um so that was early problems

360
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,920
for one the second one is like we just

361
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,440
didn't understand what VCS were looking

362
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,000
for like I legit thought Venture Capital

363
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,560
people were gamblers before like I

364
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,760
thought that there was here's 5 million

365
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,320
go see what you can do you know I just

366
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,440
thought they were just gamblers and then

367
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,880
it took us many many pitches for us to

368
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,360
realize like oh they actually want to

369
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,839
see like there's a business here and

370
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
there's you have to understand your Tam

371
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,279
and what does the growth potential look

372
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
like all these things and then once we

373
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,000
actually got to the point where like I I

374
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,360
knew how to pitch and I can actually get

375
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,560
to the point of term sheets I started to

376
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,040
realize like I don't really want to work

377
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,760
with investors they're all like they're

378
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,440
all going to make me do the things that

379
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,000
I I could see all of our predecessors

380
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,320
are doing that don't work like when

381
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,079
you're obsessed over the money you're

382
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,079
just squeezing them for more Revenue you

383
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,399
don't really care about them as

384
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,320
customers they numbers to you like none

385
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,440
of that stuff I wanted to do so it that

386
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,760
irony is once we got to the point where

387
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,480
we actually could get term sheets I'm

388
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,519
like I don't even want to do this so

389
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,639
yeah I felt uh I don't know the word for

390
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,240
it right now but basically very

391
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,240
disconnected from the fact that like

392
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,519
something that I could see so clearly

393
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,639
was not obvious to other people so that

394
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,079
that made me feel disconnected for one

395
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,880
it put chips a huge chip on my shoulder

396
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,600
massive we joke about it all the time

397
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,320
that like and I wish I did this but we

398
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,639
call it the list of all the people who

399
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,079
didn't believe in us like I wish I

400
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,920
actually kept the list because okay so

401
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,839
let me tell you the story actually this

402
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,000
is a good one so at at one point

403
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,440
throughout this journey I had to keep

404
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,920
taking jobs because I just didn't make

405
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,320
enough money so it's like I was running

406
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,959
a gym had to go take a full-time job and

407
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,519
doing push press like three things at

408
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,240
once and one of the jobs I took I

409
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,000
actually had to drive past the house of

410
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
an investor who turned us down like he

411
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,079
we went to his house we sat there and

412
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,199
pitched him I thought it went really

413
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,440
well and then he went back to the fund

414
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:42,800
that was he was representing and he's

415
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
like oh they suck like don't don't

416
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,680
invest in them and so every day for like

417
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,240
a year I had to drive past his house and

418
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,600
I flipped off his house every day like I

419
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,839
was so pissed off at like like he became

420
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,720
the personification of like everyone who

421
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,839
said no to us I mean the bottom line is

422
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,399
this it's like if you're building

423
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,959
something that everyone recognizes a

424
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,399
value in there's really no value in it

425
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,160
because everyone's probably doing it if

426
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,839
you're getting like if you really

427
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,519
believe that there's something valuable

428
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,279
and nobody else can see it and the

429
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,600
gamble is like are you wrong are you

430
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,839
crazy right and that's what we had to

431
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,360
reflect on but if you're not wrong there

432
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,199
actually is a lot of value there because

433
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
if because no one else is doing it right

434
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,199
and that is what value is so it was um

435
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,320
very challenging especially as a young

436
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,079
founder you're like am I crazy like does

437
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,959
no is there really no no way we can beat

438
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,360
Mind Body here is this like it's so

439
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,320
clear to me but no one else can see it

440
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,639
and you want to believe that these

441
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
people are smarter than you you they

442
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,360
they probably are right but they just

443
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,880
don't understand your business or the

444
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,720
opportunity and the thing I didn't

445
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,839
realize at the time is like in one hour

446
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,760
they're trying to understand what you

447
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,760
spent 5 years doing right and you think

448
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,120
about it every day for 5 years and

449
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,199
they're trying to get in one hour and

450
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,800
there's just no way they can right part

451
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,399
of that's on me or the founder because

452
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,839
if you can't relay all that information

453
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,000
in an hour that's on you but at the same

454
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,480
time as a first- Time founder it's like

455
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,680
it it takes a lot of reps to get to the

456
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,880
point where you can explain it and

457
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,279
you're going to get told no for every

458
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,199
single rep that you're building that

459
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,120
ability right and that's okay it really

460
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,000
is okay yeah but let it be a chip on

461
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,920
your shoulder because that'll that'll

462
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,920
fire you up more

463
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,600
yeah so how did you fund the company for

464
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,199
the first several years it was

465
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,959
technically bootstrap yeah there's

466
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,320
there's a few different angles to it

467
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,880
we've always been Scrappy and there's

468
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,000
like two pretty impactful moments I'll

469
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,160
I'll highlight the first one we printed

470
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
a poster we actually partnered with a a

471
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
weightlifting coach who's here in San

472
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,959
Francisco and we we brought her down we

473
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,199
did a photo shoot it was very

474
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,920
inexpensive and we printed this poster

475
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,399
of like weightlifting technique and it

476
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,399
was like Chris co-founder Chris had this

477
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,880
brilliant like design eye and like

478
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
visual representation eye so he

479
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,880
basically got a high-speed camera and

480
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,000
took like the movements of a cleaning

481
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,120
jerk and a snatch and broke it down into

482
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,519
like frame by frame what your feet

483
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,680
should look like from a top down

484
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,600
position you know from all this stuff

485
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,000
put it on a poster it looked awesome and

486
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,440
uh we sold it to the Comm actually we

487
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,560
gave it away to the community but it was

488
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,079
like $10 shipping and the shipping only

489
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,519
cost us $3 so like we made $7 a thing we

490
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,240
sold like a thousand of them because

491
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,880
everyone wanted it in their gym but we

492
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,560
also it was a double dip cuz we're like

493
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,199
this will get our brand into to the gyms

494
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,680
as well so you had push press on the

495
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,560
yeah it was a push press poster so it

496
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,639
was like got them aware of our brand but

497
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,639
we made like seven Grand which and at

498
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,800
that time was like massive money the

499
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,480
second thing we did is we built a timer

500
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,639
which still works to this day like the

501
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,880
timer's still out there but what

502
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,320
happened here was like Chris designed so

503
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,959
many things for us to build and we

504
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,920
couldn't keep up we couldn't code as

505
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,000
fast as he designed and so he was like I

506
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,959
got nothing to do we went to some

507
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,480
conference where it was like a bunch of

508
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:26,880
developers were there and we met some

509
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,120
guy from like Vietnam who does mobile

510
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,959
development and Chris is like I have

511
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,360
this idea for a timer can you build it

512
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,160
and he's worked up a bunch of mocks and

513
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
the guy built it and Chris had like

514
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,959
three months of nothing to do so he just

515
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
like Managed IT we built this timer and

516
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,600
it was it's still it's still awesome

517
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
it's still I think it's like one of the

518
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,319
best timers out there still it was like

519
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,759
10 years ago it a it's a workout timer

520
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,800
so so here's the hook it was like a

521
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,040
workout timer and you know it it was

522
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,759
specific to CrossFit so you can easily

523
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,680
build like count down count up timers

524
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,720
blah blah blah but the hook was like I

525
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,560
was building all these Connections in

526
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,319
the space so I'm like I went to all the

527
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,000
like celebrities on the CrossFit world

528
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm like Hey we're building a timer can

529
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,319
you add your voice to it and so we built

530
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,040
like this language pack where it count

531
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,079
it goes like 3 2 1 go and then the

532
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,240
person can say something motivational

533
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,759
like hey you're you're halfway there

534
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,519
keep going and then we had like 20

535
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,759
different voices on it and so people

536
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,600
really like that cuz the voices were on

537
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,920
it one of my early members at my second

538
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
Gym came in and he was an ad Network ad

539
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
specialist and he's like dude show me

540
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,920
the numbers on this timer and we were

541
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,079
doing like a million workouts a month

542
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
like it just we just put it out there

543
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,920
and we didn't do anything it just it

544
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,639
just like started getting used getting a

545
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,399
million workouts a month and he's like

546
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,639
yo if I put ads on this like we can make

547
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,199
some money and so he did and you know

548
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,600
for the first like six months he was

549
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
like actively cuz I guess it's like you

550
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,880
have to actively manage the ads I don't

551
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,319
know and we're getting like 30 grand a

552
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,600
month on it like pretty decent money and

553
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,079
that like funded the company for a while

554
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,440
but then he he got busy he stopped

555
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,040
looking at it the ads started crashing

556
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,279
the timer like it just made it a

557
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
terrible experience so we ripped all the

558
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,360
ads back out and like all the ad Revenue

559
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,399
declined but like for a good year we

560
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,360
were probably making like 20 to 30 grand

561
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,040
a month on this timer that we had built

562
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,360
for free yeah and it was the same thing

563
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,440
we built the timer cuz we wanted Jims to

564
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,560
use it so they they would learn who push

565
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,560
press was yeah yeah

566
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:06,160
so if you reflect on that first chapter

567
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,640
of push press what was the most

568
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
challenging moment and I'm sure a lot of

569
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,600
software companies had this point where

570
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,600
like you get enough clients using or

571
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,439
customers using your product where it

572
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,919
would be foolish to walk away from it

573
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
but you're not you don't see a clear

574
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,079
line of sight to the type of growth that

575
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,559
makes you go like hey I can actually get

576
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,120
paid to do this cuz it's just all

577
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,720
volunteer work and Sweat Equity right

578
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,320
and there was a time in 2017 where I

579
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,799
remember turning around to Chris in the

580
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,799
gym and I was like hey I think I'm going

581
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,120
to hang it up I'm going to give up on

582
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,360
push press and I'm going to just focus

583
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,000
on the gym because I I see how the gym

584
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,000
can actually pay me to make a living

585
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,280
here and I'm tired of working three jobs

586
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,720
basically and uh him and Brian I think

587
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
kind of talked me out of it at that

588
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
point like dude just give us some time

589
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,400
like we you know we've got clients we've

590
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,760
got customers there's fit I don't really

591
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,080
remember exactly how they talk me out of

592
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,880
it but I remember being pretty much like

593
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,039
I think I have to like give up on this

594
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,360
but I didn't want to and I think

595
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,919
ultimately that was it so like there

596
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,360
those moments will come when you found a

597
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,159
company where it's just like you you

598
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,320
have to just kind of like see it through

599
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,880
there's something about your guys's

600
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,960
philosophy that that resonates with me

601
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,600
it's just like you're the durability and

602
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,880
like until you really are dead you're

603
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,559
not dead and you can find a way to get

604
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,320
through it but you've you just have to

605
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:20,440
know it's going to suck yeah do you

606
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,280
remember how many clients you had at

607
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,400
that time probably like a couple hundred

608
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,840
couple hundred yeah so you had real

609
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,320
customers real usage but it's just like

610
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,679
not there yet just didn't feel right

611
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,640
this this was probably after we were

612
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,200
making after will said no to the 10,000

613
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,600
come back at 100,00 you know it's like

614
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,120
you have these like demoralizing moments

615
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,640
where like dude we got a 10x from here

616
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,640
even for you know and like I don't even

617
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,480
see how we're going to get there so yeah

618
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,559
there there's one I think key tenant to

619
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,840
operating uh any business and it's just

620
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,520
like um if you stay alive long enough

621
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,280
you will be able to start to manufacture

622
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,799
luck we didn't know it at the time but

623
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,480
like Co was kind of around the corner

624
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,039
and that was like our like I wouldn't

625
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,520
our L our lucky moment I guess like we

626
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,720
couldn't have created but that was a

627
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,799
moment for us to like really rally into

628
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,159
yeah let's talk about that cuz um you

629
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,360
guys accelerated growth during Co which

630
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:11,799
is very ironic when all these gyms were

631
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,159
shutting down so how did that happen so

632
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,760
I think the fir the like immediately

633
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,799
when it happened I was like oh it was

634
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,520
like existential oh my God right I think

635
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,240
it was two things one I was part of a

636
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,200
mentorship group at the time and I was

637
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,640
on a call his name is Dan Martell I was

638
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,039
on a call with him and he was like he

639
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,559
said something that I will never forget

640
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,840
to this day he's like never waste a good

641
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,520
crisis and I was like what do you you

642
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,000
mean and he's like like these are the

643
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,320
moments when the winners win you know

644
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,840
and then I thought about it and I really

645
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,280
reflected on it I'm like yeah dude like

646
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,520
you don't win races on straightaways you

647
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,080
win races on turns and so that mindset

648
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,400
shift like changed a lot for me we had

649
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,679
just released free um our free version

650
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,600
without knowing that was going to happen

651
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,280
so that that was incidental luck right

652
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,919
in terms of timing but I think what

653
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,400
really accelerated us was we were like

654
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,080
okay and I just decided at that point

655
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,159
like we're putting the foot on the gas

656
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,640
with Co and we just did everything we

657
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,280
can to like circle the wagons protect

658
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,200
our gyms protect the indry like it

659
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,720
didn't even matter if you were a client

660
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,159
of ours or not and we just got really

661
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,559
vocal right this was right around the

662
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,240
time I started a podcast right around

663
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,400
the time we were like learning how to

664
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,640
express ourselves to the market and so

665
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,400
you know we gave money away to people

666
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,799
like we got a PPP loan and we uh turned

667
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,480
around and just gave a lot of that away

668
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,120
to our gyms to help support them we just

669
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
turned it into a grant a lot of the ways

670
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,679
I like to think are kind of like how do

671
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,559
you create a good scenario and everyone

672
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,120
wins but you get something out of it

673
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,799
like we got a ton of publicity but we

674
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,039
got we gave money away and my argument

675
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,480
to my Founders was like well we can

676
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,679
either spend money on on Google paid

677
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,720
clicks or we can just give the money to

678
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,799
the gyms let's give the money to the

679
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,720
gyms you know you can kind of like

680
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,360
create a lot of Goodwill moments if you

681
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,960
think like that I think what was the

682
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,600
impetus to creating that free product

683
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,520
that happened to come out at the right

684
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,720
time yeah well the right time this was

685
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,400
just pure luck honestly but the free

686
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,320
product was was born like so a lot of

687
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,120
this is just born from the we understand

688
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,840
our our customer and the industry really

689
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
well cuz we come from it and we

690
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,240
understand like when you start a brand

691
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,039
new gym 250 bucks a month is a lot like

692
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,159
that's your first two members right off

693
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,960
the table gone when you might be trying

694
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
to like fight to get 10 members you know

695
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,559
so it's like that hurts so really it was

696
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,799
just like if we know opening a gym is

697
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,679
the most painful time financially but we

698
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,480
also know that's the easiest time to get

699
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,880
on a software system and learn it why

700
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
not lean into both of those and just say

701
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,679
like we'll give it to you free UPF front

702
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,760
and then we'll create a situation where

703
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,400
like as we grow trust as we build your

704
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,880
business you'll you'll become a paying

705
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,520
client because we're so customer-centric

706
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,640
and we always have been a lot of our

707
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,200
energy and our our payment comes from

708
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,559
the energy of our customer

709
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
so and and really I think a lot of gym

710
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,159
owners flaw at this because it's like

711
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,279
they don't make enough money to live but

712
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,679
they they show up every day cuz our

713
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,120
customer energy makes them feel full uh

714
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,480
we were probably a lot the same so it

715
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,840
was the revenue was growing the

716
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,360
customers growing like we were bu like

717
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,960
we were making some key hires and some

718
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,080
and doing some good stuff but like just

719
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,120
the energy around the company and the

720
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,120
community and the people's response to

721
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,520
our co co reaction or proactive steps

722
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,320
very filling to us so I think I think we

723
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,919
we were we were amped at that time so

724
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,120
you then go raise your series a so safe

725
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,679
happens William finally invests yep what

726
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,840
is that Journey from there on for a year

727
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,760
or so yeah so I think I think the um I

728
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,640
guess the overarching theme from like

729
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,159
that from like 2019 or maybe even 2018

730
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,679
through is just a continuing

731
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,960
reinvestment in education so in 2018 is

732
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,919
2019 we joined SAS Academy which put me

733
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,760
in rooms with other Founders you it's

734
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,760
same thing it's like you're sitting

735
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,840
across from a table I I remember this

736
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,400
actually this happened here but this

737
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,520
happened at first SAS Academy went to we

738
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,760
were we were just at a million in

739
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,120
revenue and I remember being at the

740
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,520
table thinking I was like like badass

741
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,520
cuz I was like cuz they were like say

742
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,440
your name say your company say how much

743
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,200
revenue you're at I'm like we're at a

744
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,559
million like super cool and then the guy

745
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
next to me is like oh yeah we're 14 and

746
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,840
they're like we're at 18 we're at 26 and

747
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
I was like oh my God like we're nothing

748
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,200
and that happens here too like I'm like

749
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
we're at 15 and they're like we're at

750
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
100 we're at 260 we're at whatever and

751
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,520
you're like oh wow we got a long way to

752
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,840
go but like so getting in those rooms

753
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,480
list just having mindset changes of like

754
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,080
oh that's how you approach marketing oh

755
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,159
that's why you want to do sales this way

756
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,039
like changes the game then we we got

757
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
mucker and will would just bring me in

758
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,440
every month just sit down and be like

759
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,720
okay let's focus on something what you

760
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,240
you know like I never had that before

761
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,720
like someone actually like let's get

762
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,080
real tactical and focus on something

763
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,840
that changed the game for me right and

764
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,679
then being with mucker got me more

765
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,960
exposure to other CEOs who are going

766
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,640
through you know like I get to talk to

767
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,640
if you're starting a business it's like

768
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
how fast can you change your mindset

769
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,240
because you don't know what you don't

770
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,840
know so you need to be around people who

771
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,279
have been there you know and and again

772
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,600
that continues on today like we just did

773
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,240
this stuff this week where like I'm

774
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,320
listening to people who you know their

775
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,960
current problem is like how do I get

776
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,880
from 100 million to 300 million a

777
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,919
different problem set that you have to

778
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
be aware of early so I think investing

779
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,830
in your education is super critical as a

780
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
Founder

781
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,120
[Music]

782
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,679
yeah what do you charge your customers

783
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,919
what types of products are you selling

784
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,600
what is the economic model of push press

785
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,480
yeah I mean in general the basic idea

786
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,760
with a vertical SAS platform is you want

787
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,440
to build enough Goodwill and trust with

788
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,279
your customers because you're handling

789
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,880
you're helping them handle their

790
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,640
business more efficiently to the tune

791
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,960
that you can help them in every way that

792
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,880
can be digitized or maybe not maybe not

793
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,200
even digitized there is now a concept of

794
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,400
service as a software have you heard of

795
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,720
this mhm yeah so uh that's kind of how

796
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,400
we see ourselves these gym owners have

797
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,520
opened Fitness facilities all they

798
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,919
really care about is helping their

799
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,200
customers get in shape find fine Fitness

800
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,480
and fine Wellness they do not care about

801
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,400
accounting they don't want to do payroll

802
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,200
they don't want to find someone to

803
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,720
service their rowing machines they don't

804
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,159
want to do any of that stuff they just

805
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,880
have to and so I think the value ad that

806
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,880
any vertical SAS can can bring to their

807
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,080
Niche and their industry is to strip all

808
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,000
of those unnecessary jobs that get

809
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,600
created when you open a business away

810
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,799
and either you know give them ways to

811
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,120
systematize it create process around it

812
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,919
or even automate it or just take it away

813
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,120
that's my vision for vertical SAS and I

814
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
think that's why we were talking about

815
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,120
this earlier this concept of trying to

816
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,200
understand what the Tam is for vertical

817
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,039
SAS is a fallacy because the Tam is

818
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,480
literally as big as their expense their

819
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,440
expense line and their p&l in my opinion

820
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,039
for each gym yeah let's talk about that

821
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,720
a little more because there's this

822
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,279
notion in vertical Market software in

823
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,919
any business that tries to go after a

824
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,159
niche market that the T is not big

825
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,880
enough to build a great business I'm

826
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,600
sure you've heard that PTSD yes um what

827
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,960
are your views on that I just saw the

828
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,159
CEO of service Titan talked about this

829
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,799
yesterday if you can open up the p&l of

830
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,399
any small business and look at where

831
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,320
they spend their money and understand

832
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:17,159
like which of these can be productized

833
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,880
in software you actually have the right

834
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,440
to take all of that off an owner's plate

835
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,399
and and turn that into business because

836
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,080
as long as you're providing more value

837
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,600
than your charge and you're you're doing

838
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
so in a way that creates more Goodwill

839
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,559
and more Trust as you sell more products

840
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,640
you're actually doing them a service by

841
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,960
bringing it all into one house in

842
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,200
especially in the SMB space these owners

843
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,919
want I heard this term recently I love

844
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,440
these owners want one throat to choke

845
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,360
like they want one relationship that

846
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,159
they can trust and buy into and have

847
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,080
full confidence that you know they can

848
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,000
hand all of that business off and then

849
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,480
just focus on what they want to focus on

850
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,120
if when you think of Tam in in the

851
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,880
simplest sense of like oh there's only

852
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,720
100,000 gyms in the world and you can

853
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,080
only make $150 per gym CU that's what

854
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,720
your software class that's wrong because

855
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,159
it's like what about insurance and what

856
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
about payroll and what about health

857
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,960
insurance and benefits and Banking and

858
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
servicing and lending and you know

859
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,240
payments like there's a million pieces

860
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,080
to the stack that you can provide value

861
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,120
to that are just like overlooked by this

862
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,840
Tam conversation yeah so which part of

863
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,440
the stack are you addressing now and

864
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,320
what are some areas that you want to get

865
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,120
into in the future I want to get into

866
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,279
all of it Tay all of it and and it's

867
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,799
purely from the lens of like the it will

868
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:28,840
help JY so much if if they can control

869
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,520
it all from one Central Dash word right

870
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,440
and the relationships like we we bring

871
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,039
Network effects to the to the equation

872
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,399
here like I can pre-negotiate better

873
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,080
rates for water than they can get from

874
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,600
their local distributor because we we

875
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,720
will be negotiating on behalf of

876
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,840
everyone in the network right so um

877
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,799
right now we we've we built our whole uh

878
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,799
system around payments which is a whole

879
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
another funny story because when I was

880
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,840
pitching people back in 2014 on push

881
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,360
press they didn't people didn't even

882
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,240
know what payment like they they didn't

883
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,000
even count payments it didn't matter but

884
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,559
payments are so critical to this entire

885
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,880
stack we do some of their frontend lead

886
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,360
generation website development local SEO

887
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,640
marketing um and CRM tooling yeah it's

888
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,600
funny we built a branded app which

889
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,440
allows every gym to have a branded app

890
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,080
in the app store and we thought nobody

891
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,200
would use it but what we come to find is

892
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,520
like almost every gym buys it because

893
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,720
they actually want to stand out against

894
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,120
Orange Theory like this single gym has

895
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,960
no way for them to have their own app

896
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,600
otherwise and it's really cool for them

897
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,200
to be able to say like oh yeah we sit

898
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,880
next to Orange Theory in the App Store

899
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,480
so we do a branded app we have a we have

900
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,520
a platform called train which was

901
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,520
basically an early test of this uh App

902
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,919
Store concept that we're building into

903
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,559
push press that will allow for the mod

904
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,399
this is the the fix to that one form

905
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,799
field that creates you know that solves

906
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,640
everything for everyone is building

907
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,159
modular apps you know may or may not

908
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,399
come with the price tag but extend the

909
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,000
functionality push press in a very

910
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:46,720
specific way you mentioned the customer

911
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,840
support being such an important part of

912
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,440
even the early days um how how are you

913
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,679
carrying that on as the company grows

914
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,240
let's talk about that you have to deal

915
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,840
with board members sometimes who like

916
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,200
push you on things that you know are

917
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,200
nonsense to to kind of lay the to lay

918
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,480
the thing there's like these ranges that

919
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,760
you have to operate your business in so

920
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,480
like you guys want gross margin in

921
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,640
general to be like 75 to 85% rough or

922
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,880
75% or better right and for those you

923
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,080
don't know gross margin is basically

924
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,240
like your Revenue the amount of money

925
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,519
you spend on servers and you know things

926
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,559
that make the product happen and then

927
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,080
customer support because they're keeping

928
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,039
the lights on I've built my company

929
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,519
intentionally around the fact that

930
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,159
customer support is a go to market

931
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,399
strategy so I don't think it should be

932
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,320
part of gross margin that's the argument

933
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:27,200
I will forever make our customer sport

934
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,600
team and the the way our people interact

935
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,519
with our customers kicks out pass so

936
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,840
much that it turns our customers into

937
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:35,159
raving fans that become a referral it's

938
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,679
a turn reducer and a referral creation

939
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,320
and I'm sure you saw it when you're like

940
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,799
investigating us it's like what gym

941
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,840
management software should I use and it

942
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,399
should be a whole bunch of people saying

943
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,640
push press absolutely hands down use

944
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,120
push press an interesting way for

945
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Founders to think about this is like

946
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
there are industry standards for most

947
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,000
businesses to run their thing but that

948
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,399
doesn't mean you have to do that and I

949
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,880
think it took me a couple years working

950
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,279
with you to understand that I don't have

951
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,799
to do everything you say I respect

952
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,840
everything you say thanks you know but

953
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,600
but yeah every business is built

954
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,039
different right and like uh you know

955
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,600
respectfully like you don't live you

956
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,279
don't live and breathe push press to the

957
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,240
not even close to the tune that I do so

958
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,080
it's like the stuff that we you know the

959
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,320
big picture you know the industry you

960
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,640
know the trends you know the averages

961
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,840
but fight for a long time to say like

962
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,519
our customer sport team needs to be

963
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,519
overstaffed well trained highly tooled

964
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,320
and and amazing even if it means our

965
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,840
gross margin is 70% for now yeah yeah

966
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,440
which I think we actually talked about

967
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,760
at length at some point where I actually

968
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,960
told you guys don't worry about it

969
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,559
right and I think that was really good

970
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,760
alignment the early days you were

971
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,399
extremely customer obsessed maybe out of

972
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,360
necessity but you came from the gym

973
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,440
industry so you understood your

974
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,799
constituents really well how did you

975
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,799
maintain that culture until today when

976
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,679
you now have what close to 100 employees

977
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,399
yeah so I mean it starts with like

978
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,080
understanding what you want to build

979
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,799
your business around and what you feel

980
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,399
is important part of this is I felt it

981
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,039
was super important because as a gym

982
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,240
owner it's it sucks to like call into

983
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,159
your you know your software and have

984
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,760
them have no clue what being a gym owner

985
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,080
is like like I don't even know how how

986
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,720
you support that but on the other hand

987
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,440
of the equation I realized I was a

988
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,240
superpower like if all of our big

989
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,679
competitors were just oblivious to what

990
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,279
it was like to run a gym why don't we

991
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,240
lean all the way into that and just know

992
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,600
what it's like to run a gym so we and

993
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,480
and also out of necessity because we

994
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,159
were broke and we're bootstrapped we had

995
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,399
to hire whoever would work for us and

996
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,080
most people that really really want to

997
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,640
work with us are people who are

998
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,519
passionately Mission aligned so like

999
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,039
yeah I'll work for like way less than I

1000
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,480
should work for because I actually

1001
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,919
believe in what you're doing too there's

1002
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,640
something speci about that mission

1003
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,000
alignment understanding the customer

1004
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,840
paino and then you know having the the

1005
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,039
support from you know the companywide

1006
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,360
support of saying like we lean into this

1007
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,559
that has created something magical with

1008
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,760
us where you know our team even our

1009
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,760
Engineers are like they're not gym

1010
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,120
owners for the most part but they're

1011
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,880
like through osmosis or whatever they're

1012
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,640
feeling that customer L Obsession and

1013
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,799
they're becoming that you know and it

1014
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,159
starts to build some cultural things

1015
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,240
like now our VP of engineering is like

1016
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,039
when you onboard as an engineer you

1017
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,080
spend two weeks in customer support and

1018
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,720
you get to learn how they get their

1019
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,960
teeth kicked in when you make a bug

1020
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,799
right like you have you have to live

1021
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,440
that customer Journey with them so it's

1022
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,559
it is affecting our entire culture in in

1023
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,760
a very positive way we're an empathetic

1024
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,799
company like we 100% believe in our

1025
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,559
customers and and anytime a customer has

1026
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,919
a pain you'll see like people are

1027
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,399
running towards the fire the flip side

1028
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,440
of that that's dangerous is that creates

1029
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,200
potentially a hundred different

1030
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,360
directions people need something fixed

1031
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,679
in every day because there's like

1032
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,080
different things happening different gym

1033
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,480
types everything so it's like you have

1034
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,039
to develop this muscle of saying no and

1035
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,399
also being balancing your empathy of

1036
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,559
like ooh that that's painful but we

1037
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,039
can't do it right now and I think the

1038
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,399
mistake we made before was like every

1039
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,679
paino gets fixed that's a problem in

1040
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,960
multiple ways one the focus becomes

1041
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,760
fragmented in terms of like what the

1042
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,039
company's doing but two it ends up

1043
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,320
creating like Frankenstein code where

1044
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,440
it's like oh I just bolted this thing on

1045
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,000
real quick to fix this thing oh I just

1046
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,679
bolted this thing on to fix this thing

1047
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,080
and then your your software sucks in the

1048
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,240
end because it's like just a whole bunch

1049
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,840
of boltons and no real architecture you

1050
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,840
know yeah

1051
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,600
why did you start Instagram

1052
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,440
H

1053
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,799
content let's

1054
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,240
go so again this um this there the

1055
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,399
multi-pronged answer here the first one

1056
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,000
which is a recurring theme of what I'm

1057
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:18,120
going to you know always keep saying is

1058
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,080
like my competitors are not gym owners

1059
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,480
the CEO who who even knows what the CEO

1060
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,919
looks like has no voice has no passion

1061
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,760
is not there for gym owners I am so why

1062
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,279
why wouldn't I put that out there right

1063
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,240
but two I think we live in a so two we

1064
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,360
live in a day and age where people

1065
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,440
expect to learn about things that they

1066
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,639
want to interact with through various

1067
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,120
mechanisms and one of those is Media the

1068
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:44,840
younger generation maybe not our gen My

1069
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,159
Generation but definitely younger

1070
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,279
generation like they go on social media

1071
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,279
to learn about products they want to buy

1072
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,360
and do that's how they do research like

1073
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,320
we might use YP they use Instagram I

1074
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,960
also believe people buy from people

1075
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,880
especially in the SMB space so putting a

1076
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,360
face to the actual thing you're buying

1077
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,039
is important it's it's costly to build a

1078
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,639
brand that's why I want tracksuit to

1079
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,960
help me but it's very costly to build a

1080
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:09,679
brand but it it's much easier to say

1081
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,600
like I'm Dan I'm the founder founder of

1082
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
push press and this is what I believe

1083
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,000
and this is why I'm here for you and

1084
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,120
then the brand will inherit that

1085
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,799
Goodwill that I can I can build you know

1086
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,320
and I'm just saying what I believe so

1087
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,559
it's it's not hard and lastly straight

1088
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,200
out of Nal we live in a world where like

1089
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,000
you get free leverage like social media

1090
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,519
has created free leverage and in

1091
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,720
business leverages everything so like

1092
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,240
why wouldn't you take it if you if you

1093
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,919
can now granted it's an investment of

1094
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,840
your time it's investment of money but

1095
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
how else could you get a million people

1096
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,760
to see something in a month without

1097
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,440
spending millions of dollars right like

1098
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,679
you couldn't do that 10 years 20 years

1099
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,279
ago so for all those Reasons I'm I'm

1100
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,320
very very bullish on content yeah were

1101
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,919
you comfortable filming those things in

1102
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,320
the beginning absolutely not yeah AB not

1103
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,799
dude it's like as a Founder you've got

1104
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,039
to do stuff that you have to do M um and

1105
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,960
you feel like this was something you had

1106
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,760
to do had to do yeah yeah and even to

1107
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,039
the point where this is founder mode

1108
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,320
stuff but even to the point where like I

1109
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,760
bugged our marketing team to like hey

1110
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,679
get someone to work with me on this and

1111
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
they were just too busy doing other

1112
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,240
stuff so I just found my own guy and

1113
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,919
just did it myself you know yeah I felt

1114
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,320
like you you have to do it and it's

1115
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,280
going become increasingly more important

1116
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,280
as the years go by MH so you're building

1117
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,119
your personal brand how do you try to

1118
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,520
check once in a while whether this is

1119
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,079
working or if it's worth it really good

1120
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,960
question and is is it's one of those

1121
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,800
things where you can easily doubt

1122
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,359
yourself and in fact you're not going to

1123
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,040
see unless you're actually posting like

1124
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:37,760
and getting a million views on YouTube

1125
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,399
or something a lot of the results you

1126
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,280
get are intangible or hard to measure

1127
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,399
and the the tracksuit guys actually

1128
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,720
explained something in one of the

1129
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,240
breakouts so we did that I thought was

1130
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,159
great and it was basically it was the

1131
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,879
iPhone example so he gets up on stage

1132
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,200
and he says like everyone who wants to

1133
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,040
buy an iPhone the next 5 years raise

1134
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,240
your hand or not maybe not an iPhone but

1135
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,079
a smartphone right everybody raises

1136
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,520
their hand and you go okay everyone's

1137
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,480
going to buy a smartphone in the next

1138
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,359
year keep your hand raised everyone's

1139
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,079
hand or maybe half the people's hands go

1140
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,280
down right and he's like okay who's

1141
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,920
going to buy a smartphone in the next

1142
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,680
two weeks and then it's just like 1% of

1143
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
the hands stay up and what he said is

1144
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,359
like the 1% is who you're doing paid

1145
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,040
search ads for you're doing like direct

1146
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,280
paid marketing because they're in the

1147
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,040
consideration set to buy right now but

1148
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,760
the 99% of the people who had their hand

1149
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,720
up before will buy eventually and they

1150
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,040
need to know who you are what you stand

1151
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,240
for why your product matters you know

1152
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,200
like the things you're solving they need

1153
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,640
to know the general big picture but they

1154
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,960
don't need to know what the latest

1155
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,760
megapixels on the phone is you know like

1156
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,960
those are those are buying consideration

1157
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,440
points all of this content in my opinion

1158
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,320
is a channel not the channel but a

1159
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,079
channel that you can passively

1160
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,680
continually put out like who I am what I

1161
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,960
stand for why I'm doing this and and

1162
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,400
just let people know that you're there

1163
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,640
the T big Tipping Point for me with

1164
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,720
content was there's a mentor in the

1165
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,960
space that sent an email out every day

1166
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,359
day I didn't read a single email for

1167
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,079
years I didn't read one but when ever

1168
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,480
anyone asked me like who's the who's the

1169
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,800
best Mentor in the space I would say him

1170
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,119
and I asked myself why did I say that I

1171
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,560
don't know anything that I don't even

1172
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,079
know what he wrote like I just read

1173
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,760
subject lines and it's because every day

1174
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,920
he put something out I knew he cared

1175
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,800
that's it so I think I think it it Ma it

1176
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,839
just matters to do were there any

1177
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,480
concrete examples of it paying off like

1178
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,800
in a business context oh yeah that was

1179
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,400
the question huh I just totally didn't

1180
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,560
answer that I mean the the real short

1181
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,280
answer is no but I do go to events I I

1182
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,640
go to events frequently and at every

1183
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,200
event I go to multiple people multiple

1184
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,720
people will come up to me and say like I

1185
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,800
really love your content please don't

1186
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,400
stop doing that you know something to

1187
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,760
that degree I do get I've also gotten

1188
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,240
feedback of like oh I didn't know about

1189
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,920
push press we just joined and became a

1190
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,079
member but I found one of these reels

1191
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,000
you did blah blah blah so I guess that's

1192
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,440
kind of concrete idence but it's not

1193
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,280
there is no direct like I saw a real I

1194
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,280
bought push press it's usually like

1195
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,640
months later and it's just part of the

1196
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,040
like General consideration process my my

1197
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,839
goal with content is like I want my

1198
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,720
sales team to like get on a demo and

1199
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,520
have someone basically like I'm

1200
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,040
completely sold just tell me the

1201
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,560
information on how to buy like that's

1202
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,560
kind of the motion that I'm trying to

1203
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,000
build for them how would you

1204
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,560
characterize yourself as a leader like

1205
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,960
what type of leader are you I used to be

1206
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,960
uh very insecure like why would I be the

1207
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,119
leader why is my voice more important

1208
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,560
than anyone's uh every decision would

1209
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,079
turn into a committee like hey what do

1210
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,200
you guys think what do you think I am

1211
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,359
now much more becoming there are certain

1212
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,839
decisions that I will just make and I I

1213
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,359
don't don't feel bad about that anymore

1214
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,640
I don't feel insecure about that just

1215
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,359
because I see how much bureaucracy and

1216
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,040
Chaos it creates when I start asking for

1217
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,359
everyone's opinion and we start tallying

1218
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,960
votes and then we have debates and

1219
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,000
discussions that go nowhere it just

1220
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,400
doesn't help so I think I'm evolving as

1221
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,520
a leader I think no matter what I'm

1222
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,920
always going to be empathetic I'm going

1223
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,800
to care what people think I'm going to

1224
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,359
listen to people's opinions but I'm

1225
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,480
becoming much more um able to just say

1226
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,280
cool I heard all your opinions this is

1227
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,920
what we're doing and is there anything

1228
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,160
that you're actively working on to get

1229
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,560
better at at this moment the the the

1230
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,920
real answer to this if you're looking

1231
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,280
start a company is like you're going to

1232
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,520
be actively getting better at whatever

1233
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,560
the biggest fire is at every moment of

1234
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,560
the company and it will never stop uh

1235
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,440
right now I'm trying to become better at

1236
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,359
the financial and operational end of

1237
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,200
things it's something I'm absolutely

1238
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,079
horrible horrible at I know very little

1239
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,920
of so just understanding like how does

1240
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,880
annual planning work and and what really

1241
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,680
got me into this was like for us to like

1242
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,040
think about a three-year plan and start

1243
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,119
to look at like what three years looks

1244
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,079
like I realize I had to build stuff now

1245
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,800
to be able to even get close to having

1246
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,440
this three-year plan and I liken a lot

1247
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,680
of this stuff to like farming I don't

1248
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,640
know why I always think about farming

1249
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,160
but you can't like Harvest your grapes

1250
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,200
if you haven't planted them and it might

1251
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,599
take a whole season for the planting the

1252
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,800
seeds for the grapes to grow and then

1253
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,359
another season for the you know the

1254
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,520
grapes to whatever and so when you think

1255
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,960
about that way it's like you really have

1256
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,720
to get ahead of all this stuff to be

1257
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,520
able to get the grapes in three years

1258
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,880
you know yeah my big Focus right now is

1259
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,079
like how do you become operationally

1260
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,440
more sound how do you run better

1261
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,480
meetings how do we do like better board

1262
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,839
meetings better monthly Recaps annual

1263
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,319
planning all that stuff is kind of where

1264
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,960
I'm at what about the the mission cuz in

1265
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:04,720
the beginning there was no mission to

1266
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,200
empower the fitness industry there was

1267
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,680
no mission that was that grand and then

1268
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,119
it became that and so how has the

1269
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,640
mission of this company changed over

1270
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,000
time the mission honestly has forever

1271
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,119
been something Loosely formed around

1272
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,520
like be I remember one of the first

1273
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,359
board meetings we came to here it was

1274
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,000
like or maybe it was the first CEO

1275
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,839
conference or whatever but we left with

1276
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,800
a mission of like we want to help a

1277
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,920
billion people become fitter but then we

1278
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,040
kind of were like how does how do you

1279
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,720
measure that you know it just became

1280
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,440
really weird or should they be you know

1281
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,480
like all this stuff so we've always had

1282
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,160
this loose idea of we're really here to

1283
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,400
make the world fitter and again this is

1284
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,119
part of like maybe some people have the

1285
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,800
skill something I'm developing but like

1286
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,000
in order to be a good leader you have to

1287
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,280
be able to pack a lot of amorphous ideas

1288
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,800
into very concrete like eight-word

1289
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
sentences you know what I mean like you

1290
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
have to be very clear and it's got to be

1291
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,880
memorizable and repeatable and I think

1292
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,240
I'm getting better at it but yeah that's

1293
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,680
why it like it went from something that

1294
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,960
was like very hazy into like we are just

1295
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,280
here to make the world fitter by helping

1296
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,640
our gyms become better businesses that's

1297
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,160
it do you have a view on what the

1298
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,640
fitness world would look like in say 10

1299
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,680
20 years and how does technology play

1300
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,160
into that Journey oh that's big this can

1301
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,680
go so many different ways because the

1302
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,319
problem with Fitness is it's an IT

1303
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,000
everyone looks for easy buttons and

1304
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:19,000
fitness is not the easy button and so

1305
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,680
right now what you get is you get 10% or

1306
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,280
5% of the people in the world who are

1307
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,280
okay pushing the hard button because

1308
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,680
that's what they're into doing it but

1309
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,520
we're missing the mark on the 90 to 95%

1310
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,079
of people who just want OIC you know or

1311
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,920
who want the Easy Button I'm actually

1312
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,400
starting to generate this thesis which

1313
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,160
we should talk about sometime okay that

1314
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,319
gyms should sell community and we should

1315
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,200
solve loneliness first and the fitness

1316
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:43,720
is the byproduct people show up at the

1317
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
gyms that they that we support because

1318
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,839
they're showing up for their friends as

1319
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,480
much as they're showing up for themsel

1320
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,599
and it's almost like church where church

1321
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,640
for the body you have this you know

1322
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,359
every day I go I pay my penants or

1323
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,800
whatever you know I do my thing and at

1324
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,440
the end of the result is like oh wow I

1325
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,640
got fitter but really it's like you're

1326
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,000
loneliness in the moment and the easy

1327
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,599
button is loneliness which I think is a

1328
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,319
is a real thing it's I don't know maybe

1329
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:05,880
weird to talk about but the community is

1330
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,839
something actually very impactful in

1331
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,800
these gyms so if we can figure out this

1332
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:12,520
easy button and you can flip it and get

1333
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,200
90% of people in the gyms like we could

1334
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,079
have literally like 20 times more gyms

1335
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,440
in the world just overnight so to me

1336
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,400
it's like there's a big growth

1337
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,480
opportunity if we actually attack the

1338
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,520
problem that's stopping people from

1339
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,359
coming into the gym yeah that's powerful

1340
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,960
how how do you want push press to be

1341
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:31,040
remembered after your time uh hopefully

1342
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,240
not remembered cuz that means

1343
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,880
dead or how do you find people to talk

1344
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,839
about push press yeah near

1345
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,040
2300 um this one might not this so this

1346
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,119
might not answer the question directly

1347
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,440
cuz I haven't thought about that to be

1348
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,480
honest but it does it Loosely will so

1349
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,160
one thing I have noticed in the fitness

1350
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,640
industry that that annoys me is there

1351
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,599
are very few multigenerational companies

1352
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,280
and if you look across like I think

1353
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,839
Fitness is a tested tried andrue

1354
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,960
industry but if you look at other ones

1355
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,960
Automotive entertainment whatever

1356
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,680
like there are companies that have been

1357
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,319
around for 100 years and I know Fitness

1358
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,400
is newer to some regard but there is no

1359
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,240
50-year-old Fitness Company really um I

1360
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,599
guess maybe like 24-Hour Fitness

1361
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,400
although they're kind of on the decline

1362
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,160
and and the reason is I think it's

1363
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,480
because the Easy Button problem oh well

1364
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,800
you know like what's the newest fad

1365
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,800
we'll do Shake Weights like okay let's

1366
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,040
sell those on TV let's do jazzer size

1367
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,200
and everything turns into like a DVD buy

1368
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,040
it now for $29.99 and it dies in a year

1369
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
and I think like what we need to start

1370
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,680
having in the fitness industry is like

1371
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,040
multigenerational companies that live

1372
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,319
because they're not built on hype and

1373
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,800
they're not built on fads but they're

1374
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,640
built on something real and that's

1375
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,440
ultimately like where my mind has

1376
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,839
started to go like this company

1377
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,040
definitely should outlive me and it

1378
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,760
should support an industry that is

1379
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,119
outliving all the people who open the

1380
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,119
gyms themselves
