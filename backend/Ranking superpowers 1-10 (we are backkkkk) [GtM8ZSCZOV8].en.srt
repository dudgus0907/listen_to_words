surprise is a good word yes 200 Urban

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,540
surprise oh that's a good one because

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,920

the only time the word unboxing can come

64
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,220
into play is if you get sent something

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,480

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,459

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,279
something about a higher power and

206
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,539
detrimental incidents oh yeah Nick's

207
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,740

208
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,020
in his life

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,459

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:53,580
please okay as I was saying like Nick

211
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,220
I'm gonna [ __ ] I'm just laughing that

212
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,540
you'll never ever

I didn't look to the camera my head is

214
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,180
straight you'll never look again is what

215
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,459
I'm saying because your head will be the

216
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,019
other way you [ __ ] dummy

217
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,000
oh

218
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,920
something bad would happen like you'd

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
lose like a chunk of your like like five

220
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,080
years off your life maybe like all four

221
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,860
of your fingers on your left hand like

222
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,459
[ __ ] like all four whatever four

223
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,200
you're four

224
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:24,200
oh you think it has a question

225
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,019
your four main like fingers you have to

226
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,920
like can't shower

227
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:37,500
oh my God I'm not never mind go go yeah

228
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,480
like I'm honestly it's like a chance of

229
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,399
something bad happening and then

230
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,560
something we need you to be specific and

231
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,620
say hey would you get super powers if

232
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,600
this had to happen to you

233
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,980
yes no okay yeah sounds good let's keep

234
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,920
going because I'm not I'm done with that

235
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,860
question thank God no the the answer is

236
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,420
no I wouldn't I would absolutely cool so

237
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,140
I got my answers there you go regardless

238
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,040
good job you good job um

239
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,620
I just don't know how you can feel

240
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,180
satisfied out there at least you're

241
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,820
satisfied after just being a goofball

242
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,320
for 24 hours a day at least I have one

243
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,560
main finger though right yeah you're

244
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
funny

245
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,959
oh God I had Nick's laugh I didn't lose

246
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,959
my mind

247
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,240
okay so we're talking about superpowers

248
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,740
and ranking them in which order we would

249
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,720
want to do that because you didn't so

250
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,500
let's get into the first one

251
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,160
super strained uh corny so overrated

252
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,080
yeah it's like the most lame one like oh

253
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,540
you can pick stuff up and throw it you

254
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,760
angry bastard calm down it'd be perfect

255
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,120
for Chris Nick I would destroy you

256
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,860
because he gets all upset and tries

257
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,459
like a melon you goof he gets all

258
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,459
stressed out

259
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,720
I thought that was a [ __ ] dinosaur on

260
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,459
T-Mobile

261
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,720
let's try to do super strength is like

262
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,720
he's like Hero on my list like

263
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,480
super powers it'd be really cool if you

264
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,260
had to move though I feel like something

265
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,940
I feel like it's on 10. yeah

266
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,000
um in the invisibility

267
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,459
that's a solid like four that's top five

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,019
for me I think right now I'm comfortable

269
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,579
with it at four but it may need to

270
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,440
switch if I was invisible the first

271
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,300
thing I'd do is rob a bank should we

272
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,060
write this all down or go to a store no

273
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,540
just a list off the top of the head okay

274
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,540
foreign

275
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,940
would just be running super super speed

276
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:39,060
number two no I feel like it's equal to

277
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,399
one because equivalent

278
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,260
is number two because it is the

279
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,360
equivalent exactly what you just said so

280
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,800
therefore number two why would why would

281
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,740
we tie it well because it's the same

282
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,180
[ __ ] thing no it's not it's okay

283
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,800
okay like one two thanks

284
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,820
guys

285
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,200
don't worry it's gonna be on two

286
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,300
teleport was so you can be somewhere

287
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,980
without getting out or run really fast

288
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,019
oh but it's the same thing they'll both

289
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,540
just be watching like are you serious

290
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,920
red delicious

291
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,220
oh they're both red apples same thing no

292
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,019
they're [ __ ] not all right

293
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,540
okay cool one two skip three

294
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:22,079
invisibility super strength to the ten

295
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,240
next laser beam eyes zero like you can

296
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,160
carve [ __ ] that's like a nine that's

297
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
giving nine for me that's switching in

298
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,180
ten I'd rather have super strength and

299
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,540
Laser absolutely true okay boom now I

300
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,360
got I think I got hey hey I think we are

301
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,360
here all night not anymore we argued you

302
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,860
are rightfully laser beam eyes what like

303
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,019
I feel like I just use it if I'm a

304
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,040
little angry or something like like I

305
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,600
said I wouldn't want to use it on

306
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,100
someone I'd use it to like carve down

307
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
walls and just walk through them sure

308
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,700
and I feel like at that point I'll just

309
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,500
find the entrance to things read

310
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,000
um what about I think I got my number

311
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,760
four spot what

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,620
shape-shifting I was gonna [ __ ] say

313
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,300
that like imagine just becoming a penny

314
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,760
and then rolling in the store like you

315
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,079
know what you know what like that's I

316
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,240
have something that's higher than that

317
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,880
and you can I'd rather shape-shift you

318
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,040
could become to anybody like I honestly

319
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,839
think we put super speed way too high I

320
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,579
agree I think we put it on like eight

321
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,959
that's why I equated it with one because

322
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,399
it's the same thing I think we put it on

323
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,519
eight that's why I just equated it with

324
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,820
well that would be stupid wait how the

325
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,139
[ __ ] would your number one number

326
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,600
teleportation's already there I'm not

327
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,760
gonna put super speed as high why

328
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
because as I say why do we make other

329
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
sponges in this world when we already

330
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,639
have a sponge it's just this it's in the

331
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,500
notebook no we don't we have a phone

332
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,760
what you're trying to do I'll put it on

333
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,920
my hand no no we're gonna eat no just

334
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,420
write them on [ __ ] phone are you guys

335
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,800
don't got paper two three four five what

336
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,899
next what do you think we should do

337
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,579
shape shifting I'm really feeling I

338
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,260
think that number two because now that

339
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm thinking about it hold on I'm kind

340
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,720
of thinking no we can't once it's on

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,399
this paper it's a lot hold on I'm

342
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,399
thinking these are above teleportation

343
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,079
now hear me out no hear me out if you

344
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,820
can have one or the other teleportation

345
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,860
all you can do is teleport if you can

346
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,600
shape-shift you could shape-shift for so

347
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,180
many different uses and then not only

348
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,680
that if you shape shift in my mind your

349
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,820
DNA like shape shifts what you're

350
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,779
shape-shifting too you know what I mean

351
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,339
you're wrong like if you're like

352
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,019
shape-shifting to a tiger and someone

353
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,360
swabs your mouth you have tiger DNA it

354
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,740
won't be nixster I agree yes same with

355
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,959
like a fingerprint if I shape shift to

356
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,820
Chris my fingerprint that's incorrect no

357
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,800
yeah I'm completely correct so what I'm

358
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,920
saying is I don't know instead you could

359
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,380
