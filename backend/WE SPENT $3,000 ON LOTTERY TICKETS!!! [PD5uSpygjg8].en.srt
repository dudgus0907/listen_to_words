on what up everyone stop spinning the

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,920
coin what's up everybody in front of the

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,160
table is $3,000 of debt yes basically

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,279
30s 20s 10 fives threes twos and ones so

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,840
we're $3,000 in debt our goal is to see

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,400
if we can get out of debt or see how

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,760
much doubt we can get how much debt we

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,519
can get out of we're going to scratch

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,480
some tickets and our ultim goal for this

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,840
entire video is to get this 3,000 to a

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,480
lower and then higher number I'm hitting

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,719
big first one all right I doubt it all

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,680
right hold on Nick has been making fun

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,640
of me cuz I've been talking about

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,960
neighbor tickets and all that type of

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,160
stuff no the neighbor ticket is the one

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,840
that's next to it in the machine so like

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
a lot of people don't buy back to back

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,120
because like this see how this is this

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,000
is ticket number 23 that's ticket number

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,320
24 we're going to lose no matter what

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,760
what is this cross word it's a toad

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,439

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,479

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,360
ticket oh if it says ticket that's the

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,200
money back so I think that's 20 we we're

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,119
a little knowledgeable because of our

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,240
our time at Star Market at the desk so

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,479
ticket basically means they'll exchange

37
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,000
this losing ticket for another $20

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,320

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,840

$20 bill correct that's not true we're

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,560

good one that's a good name all right

111
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,000
guys what's up um so we're I know we're

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
in the middle of doing the scratch

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,759
ticket video right now so it's weird

114
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,680
that I just popped up in the middle of

115
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,400
the car but the other day I said like oh

116
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
if we film this video if one of you

117
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,919
[ __ ] idiots get one of those fake

118
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,160
scratch tickets I'm going to be so mad

119
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,600
and they were like oh that's such a good

120
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,240
idea blah blah blah you should have done

121
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,680
should have done that and I was like

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,960
wait that was a good idea I should have

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
done that but now that I said it out

124
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,680
loud and they think like oh like I

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
wouldn't do it I think now it would be

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,600
more believable especially with this one

127
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,120
cuz all the other ones like like the $2

128
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,880
ones and everything came in the but this

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,280
is a $5 one and it's literally I checked

130
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,039
the exact same size as the other one and

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,319
I said that I I was not going to get a

132
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,199
fake ticket yesterday and I overnighted

133
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,720
this and it came today so I think that

134
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,000
this could fool them so I'm going to do

135
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,000
my best attempt this is a $5 ticket and

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,960
it's going to

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,479
show that we won

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,880
$100,000 so 73 11 and

139
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,479
9 I like this one it's very simple we

140
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,039
should keep this

141
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,360
one

142
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,280
18

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
65

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,360

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,639

147
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:26,360
19 32 did you lose I'm losing so far

guys bought this one is a fake no oh my

160
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,039
God one of you bought this as a

161
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,680
fake one of you bought this as a

162
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,960
oh my God I bought that on Amazon this

163
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,440
morning did you a f yeah and I put it in

164
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,080
that pile I knew it right away I knew it

165
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,319
right away godam I knew it

166
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:17,080
right I knew it right away yes I knew to

167
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,360
do that that was good no cuz guys the

168
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,319
reason I didn't think it would be that

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,960
is cuz Matt show me the money it looks

170
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,520
like the fakest card ever it looks so

171
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,840
simple it looks like the fakest card

172
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,120
like this one it's simple I should have

173
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,080
known I was buying the reason it's so

174
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,080
the reason it's so funny too is Matt

175
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,919
suggested that idea yesterday and then I

176
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:42,000
already I went to the car to record that

177
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:43,919
oh wow you're crazy I know I did so good

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,960
that was a good prank Matt that was good

179
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,479

total we have gained

442
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,840
$2,389 still which sucks ass we need one

443
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,039
of these to be like a $1,000 winner

advise this this is for entertainment

450
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,000
purposes in order to bring the luck we

451
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,159
each brought a lucky device or object to

452
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,520
today's scratching session my lucky

453
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,840
item

454
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,880
is the fake $100,000 winner cuz this is

455
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,360
this is

456
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,559
manifestation and it's it's channeling

457
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,640
the luck even though it is fake it's

458
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:33,200
channeling the fact that this is a

459
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:37,280
$1,000 winner into into the Vibes I'm

460
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,280

463
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,679

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,080
Lincoln because I was already a winner

465
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,240

my versus to trophy so that I can really

467
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,880
embody Victory and being a winner crazy

468
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,679

469
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,039
so many numbers on the card and and

470
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,480
they're like oh it's because we want you

471
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,559

472
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480

00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:39,480
$2,035 in my hand so we

711
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,279
lost a lot of money [ __ ] this $35 we we

712
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,799
lost we lost ,000 basically essentially

713
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,240
essentially we lost $11,000 out of all

714
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,399
the tickets we bought three of them were

715
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,120
over $100 we won shockingly more than I

716
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,880
thought I agree still not worth it and I

717
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,159
think the only reason we did well is cuz

718
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,320
we had so many but the thing is too with

719
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,080
the lotteries like people do it even

720
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,039
when the odds are so low cuz they think

721
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,600
they're actually going to hit like a

722
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,279
billion qu million dollars yeah like

723
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,799
what's with that thought process yeah

724
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,559
but it is I think they're fun to like

725
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:16,080
give as a gift for a birthday or like

726
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,080
play once a year but like seriously guys

727
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,639
gamble responsibly please we just we're

728
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,960
,000 in debt whatever we'll survive like

729
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,519
this video if you want to see us try

730
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,639

experiment stupid

734
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,360
things basically if we shred our money

736
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,039
$1,000 in a shredder is literally what

737
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,320
