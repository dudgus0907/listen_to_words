00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,839
Hi Sharks. My name's Kimmy and I'm from

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,880
Oceanside, California. I'm the intuitive

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,960
baker extraordinaire behind Doughnut.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,240
I'm seeking 100,000 for 10% equity in my

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,400
company. Sharks. We all know Americans

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,480
struggle with salt, fat, and sugar

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
addiction. But eating a sugar-free,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,119
gluten-free, and or dairyfree diet can

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
often feel like you're eating dry

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,080
cardboard with high calories and an

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,920
unappealing aftertaste. That's why I

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,559
took on the challenge to create a

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,160
healthy version from a guilty pleasure.

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,000
Say hello to doughnut.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,320
This might look like it's full of sugar

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,079
or ingredients that we can't pronounce.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,239
But what if I told you that this

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,719
contains no dairy, no gluten, less than

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,360
one gram of sugar found naturally in

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,000
sweet potatoes, and you can count the

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,800
ingredients with one hand. Let me

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,840
sweeten the deal for you. It's only 90

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,879
calories. The magic behind doughnut is

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,920
in organic gats, which are oats in its

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,840
original purest form. Once the farmers

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,880
harvest the oats, they are tested for

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,360
gluten, packed, and shipped to my little

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,000
pink store where I mill it into fresh

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
oat flour. It's a farm to finger

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,320
experience.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,119
Sharks, who's ready to partner with me

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,720
and bite into the best decision of your

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
life? Me me me me me me me me me me me

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,159
me me me me me me me me me me me. Little

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,479
pink store. Is it really? I think it is.

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
So each of you have a couple of my

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,000
donuts in front of you representing my

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,079
most popular flavors. Churro, which is

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,400
That's what I just ate. I think it is

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
sugarree by the way. This frosting is

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,520
all sugarree, dairy free. It smells so

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
good. It can't. And what do you use? Do

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,000
you use any sugar alcohols? Are you

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
using alulose or stevia? We use monk

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,720
fruit as the sweetener. This is great.

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,439
That chur one. Very good. This is just

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,159
90. That's right. And it has 2 g of

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,439
fiber in it. 2 g of fiber. So ingredient

49
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,759
wise, it's your oats, your special gats.

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,160
Mhm. Oats, sweet potatoes, egg whites.

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,399
Egg whites, monk fruit. Mhm. What's

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
number five? Baking powder. Baking

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
powder.

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
I've never heard of the term gross. You

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
like it. So like, did you come up with

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,360
that term or is that a term that's used

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,000
in Yeah, that's a term. So when when the

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,879
farmers harvest the oats, when they pull

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,640
it off the husk, that's a gat. So it has

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,840
not been touched at all. So you're

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,760
grinding the whole fiber seed. I am. The

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,840
benefit of milling it yourself is one,

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,519
you're retaining the natural oils that

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
are found in whole grains versus it's

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,760
sitting on a shelf. And then it also has

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,160
almost like a brown butter almost taste

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
to it. And I mill it fresh every

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
morning. Well, Kimmy, I will say

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
something. We get a lot of products like

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,160
this here in Shark Tank cuz people are

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,560
concerned about sugar, salt, all of

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,040
that. These actually don't taste like

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
I'm amazed. No, they taste really good.

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,840
How are you distributing them? Yes. So,

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,920
I have a little pink store. I actually

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
Of course you have a pink store. Look at

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,080
how cute that is. Super cute. That's the

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,760
little pink

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,920
store. Yes. So, I I sell at my little

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,680
pink store and I actually just turned 2

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
years old. So, how much does it cost you

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,319
to make these doughnuts? And what do you

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,360
sell them for? It cost me between.70 and

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,800
80ent to make it. Okay. And we retail it

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,879
at the store for $3.50. Too cheap. You

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,040
know, for a solution like this, I think

87
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
$4.99 works. I could eat half one of

88
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,680
these for dessert. That's 45 calories

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
without any spiking. That's fantastic.

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
The question is, how to scale this

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,760
business? How many can you make if this

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
thing blows up online? So, right now, I

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
do all the baking. I do all the

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
marketing. I do all the selling. I do

95
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,280
all everything

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,159
how you going to scale it. But that's

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,879
why I'm here, Mr. Wonderful. So that I

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,760
can scale it hopefully. Do you ship them

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,439
frozen? So I don't. I ship them fresh

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,599
and then I put a little note card to

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,920
refrigerator freeze right away. And are

102
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,239
you shipping to other bakeries or other

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,959
businesses? So when I first started, I

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
went from gym to gym uh selling my

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,280
doughnuts. And as a matter of fact, this

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,639
is a full circle moment for me because

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,840
my very first popup event, I sat at my

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,000
table next to this most beautiful table

109
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,080
that had some gorgeous jewelry on it.

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,400
And I walked over to introduce myself to

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,680
the gal and she said, "This is Kendra

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,960
Scott jewelry. I love it." And she went

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,919
on to tell the story about how you

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,360
started in your spare bedroom with $500

115
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,800
and that you went from boutique to

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,880
boutique. And at that moment, I dared to

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,759
dream. Oh, I dared to dream that it was

118
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,000
possible to have big dreams. Now here I

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,560
am, and I just feel like things happen

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,360
for a reason. They absolutely do. I

121
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,280
mean, what an amazing story. And you

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
should dream big. You were destined to

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,160
be next to our little table that day. I

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,160
love that. But you're a single operator,

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,280
Kimmy. You're coming in here for 100

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
grand and investors want to see returns

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,800
and you're not worth a million bucks

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
yet. The pro listen the product you know

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
you don't even know our number we don't

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
know it's just wonderful. Let me tell

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,000
you my total sales have been 350,000

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,960
since the beginning of time from 2021.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,320
What about this year lifetime? Yeah. For

134
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,080
sales this year are $50,000.

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,600
Okay. That's not a lot of of sales,

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,639
Kimmy, to be honest with you. From my

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,479
point of view, the product's

138
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,120
spectacular. I will become a customer,

139
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,440
but you're not worth a million bucks

140
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,199
right now. I don't see doing this deal

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,160
cuz there's no plan for me to get a

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,080
return. But I'll be be a customer. Oh,

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
Mr. Wonderful. But we could do wonderful

144
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
things for you. I know, but I don't need

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,000
a job as a chef. I'm already a chef. I'm

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
the chef, Mr. Wonderful. I just need

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,720
your money. No, listen. It's It's a

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
great product without a business plan.

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,479
That's what it is. You just have a great

150
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,039
product. That's a great place to start

151
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,800
because this is actually a good product

152
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
and and I never say that unless it's

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,199
true. It's a very good product. I'm

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,880
sorry, but I'm out. Kimmy, I um I like I

155
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,479
like it, but this is not my type of

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,000
business. I think there's some more

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
qualified sharks up here with better

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,520
experience in that area. So, uh I wish

159
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,919
you luck. Uh I'm out. Thank you, Damon.

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,240
Do you see like part of your plan is to

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,960
open more Little Pink stores? Like, is

162
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,840
that part of the dream? Oh, absolutely.

163
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,319
Well, listen, Kimmy. I had one store in

164
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,199
Austin, Texas, and I could have never

165
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,440
dreamt that today I would have 138. So,

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,160
I love your dare to dream because it is

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
possible. It is possible with a great

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,319
product and dedication to it. You're

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,880
doing all those things. I'm sitting here

170
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,680
and I'm I'm struggling. One, I love you

171
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,840
and I I look at you and I see so much uh

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,080
similarity going into a market that is,

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,880
you know, a very big market. You have

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,639
that tenacity. You have that passion. I

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,720
can see it. I can feel it from sitting

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,199
here with you. And the product is

177
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,880
