91
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:28,280
vividly remember our older brother

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,760
Justin's 21st birthday anyway that just

93
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,480
freaks me out cuz it's like whenever I

94
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,360
remember something happening for someone

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,760
else and then I'm about to experience it

96
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,239
it's like whoo you know what I mean like

97
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,200
I that's like a very fond memory of mine

98
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,239
which if someone eats a bowl of soup or

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,239
you going to eat a bowl of soup and be

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,519
like whoa no a big deal to someone close

101
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,959
like if someone turns 50 you're going to

102
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,799
be like oh my God I remember like my

103
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,400

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,319
turning 50 exactly like even when I'm

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,599
turning like 30 I'll be like oh I

106
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,799
remember when Justin turned 30 cuz he's

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,400
like the perfect age difference so

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,079
you're explaining having an older

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
sibling yeah but I just think it's like

110
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,480
a crazy thing cuz I remember being such

111
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000

by like a semi awkwardly tall mummy it

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,000

snip snip smidge yeah it was just really

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
weird and they were like murmuring it's

140
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,960
it felt like a different language but I

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,000
knew it was English no I was really

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,319
scared because like I knew it was

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,840
English like CU I could comprehend it

144
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,000
but it didn't even seem like they were

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,120
speaking

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
like no no it sounded like they were

147
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,039
just saying like adjectives one after

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,039
another red greenow blue purple yes

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,520
exactly like that correct it was like

150
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,759
purple light pose it's like when I do

151
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,800
those jokes about like how I some things

152
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,199
like it's just like crazy like oak tree

153
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,680
license plate lamp post awkward lighting

154
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
yes that's exactly how it felt no but I

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
was also really scared cuz the second

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,919
that she got parallel with our car she

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,960
took her NE she looked at it and took

158
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,360
the mask off and I was like if this

159
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,800
psychopath starts running at my car

160
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,880
right now I'm going to lose my it was

161
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,400
really uncomforting and what was really

162
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,840
tripping me out was like the assistant

163
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,400
mommy on the back doing nothing just

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,240
like kind of limping with an awkward

165
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,479
stride behind her toet no clue too much

166
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,680
purge mask weird cloak and awkward mummy

167
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,280
was this is coming from someone who

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,520
literally cannot walk in a straight line

169
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,599
but sometimes I see people walking so

170
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,039
slow or so bizarrely or like they're

171
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,759
limping and dragging their feet that I

172
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,080
genuinely catch myself looking to check

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,720
if their [ __ ] ankles are broken I'm

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,240
like are your feet SN in half with the

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,840
way you're dragging your [ __ ] tibula

176
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,880
on the [ __ ] cement wrong bone I know

177
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,280
I said the wrong bone I think you com

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,160
your your patella is grazing tiles on

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,560

Victoria Justice Victoria Justice one of

407
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,519
our friends when we were in like fifth

cousins M mat and Chris and another one

411
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,759
of our friends to Victoria Justice cuz

412
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,480
it was her favorite artist I think I was

413
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,560
like I think I was like that was like my

414
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,560
early stages of like paranoia and I was

415
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,680
just like it was the first I don't I I

416
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,600
don't think I realized how loud concerts

417
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,399
were I love Victoria Justice day like

418
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm not familiar with like her modern

419
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,079
music like I remember all the songs for

420
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,680
like Victorious and stuff but she's so

421
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,920
cool like she's a great person I'm sure

422
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,600
so sweet I agree yeah I also went with

423
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,480
my cousin to see pentatonics and Kelly

424
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,880

425
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,680

426
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000

427
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,959

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,720
without you guys damn that's crazy I

429
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,440

for dancing so I can call them my

431
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,639

never told another triplet do you guys

439
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,160
have like something I like I wouldn't

440
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,720
know that you guys were willing to share

441
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,720
with me on the internet right now

442
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
um I guess the answer is no um I don't

443
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,280
have anything like on the top of my head

444
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,240
you guys pretty much know everything

445
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,520
about me like I'm I'm trying to think of

446
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,079
something you guys don't know about me

447
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,079
and I can't I'm trying to think I agree

448
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,600
I think it's so funny that people say

449
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,280
like like people ask questions like how

450
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,120
did you guys know you wanted to moved to

451
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,720
LA and wanted to live with each other

452
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,280
and it's so crazy that people like think

453
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,039
like that cuz it's like no Hate to this

454
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,039
person but like we've never not lived

455
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,200
with each other like we are triplet

456
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,919
siblings so no I guess they mean like

457
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,120
continue to do that yeah but it's like

458
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,400
when did you chose Jo to live together

459
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,400
it's like we've never we never had the

460
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,400
choice to not I mean yeah no we did yeah

461
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,000
when we like moved out I guess yeah but

462
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,480
it's like it's a valid totally valid

463
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,320
question dumb ass you think so

464
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,280
100% 100% to me it's like obvious yeah

465
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,720
it's obvious because of the fact that we

466
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,320
want to live together but to the outside

467
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,640
perspective Nick yeah I guess absolutely

468
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
valid question yeah you're right

469
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,360
whatever I can I can take that L

470
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,360
pondering out the window idiot have you

471
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,039
ever shaved your legs Chris did a super

472
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,039
early on in one of our YouTube Channel

473
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,039
videos cuz we had to wax his legs as a

474
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,200
punishment yep years ago that was our

475
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,080
third video ever potentially crazy yeah

476
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
and then I shaved my other one so they

477
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,559
matched and I had no leg hair is the

478
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,360
weirdest feeling ever like that's the

479
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,120
only time that I've ever not had leg

480
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,200
hair in my whole life when you were

481
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,840
fresh out dude obviously you didn't

482
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,360
don't refer to like being born frh never

483
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,039
ever ever do that again you didn't have

484
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,400
leg hair when you were a [ __ ] baby

485
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,760
correct what I'm saying is that's the

486
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,960
only memory I like little babies that

487
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
are so cute I'm being for real my whole

488
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,960
life I've had leg hair on my head like I

489
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,480
