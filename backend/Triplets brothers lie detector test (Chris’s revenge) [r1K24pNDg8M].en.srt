where you were going or what you were

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:16,759

don't think I lied to you but I think I

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,400
might have told you I was going

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,919
somewhere and then like got in like the

93
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,680
car at Michaela in high school and like

94
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,560
she went somewhere before and I just

95
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,199
never updated you like I think it was

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
like lying maliciously but I do think I

97
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,039
told you I was going somewhere and I

98
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,240
didn't if needed would you give me your

99
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:38,600
kidney

100
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,240
no a li a deep down deep down he cares I

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,120
think it's more just because I'd say no

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,199
cuz I'd be too scared to go through that

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,080
like surgery but you would if it was

104
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,400
like if you really needed it but if you

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,000
could get a kidy from someone else I'd

106
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,639

remember like yeah I lie to them but it

143
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,840
was like I think you just use that as a

144
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Divergent for a bigger situation no

145
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,880
there was like there's sometimes I lie

146
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,000

147
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,680
it's like you know it's like it's like

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,039

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,520
something not for any personal

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,919
benefit have you ever gone through mine

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,919

156
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,800
no true no need I don't want to see

157
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,560

your brothers

161
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,039
no

162
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,240
true I do think me and Matt argue more

163
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,800
but that's not the question that's not

164
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,639
do you you think I would be a better

165
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,639
boyfriend than

166
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,120
Chris

167
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,520
no true think he'd be pretty

168
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,960
even I think Chris is harder to get into

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,000
that situation but once he is I feel

170
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,639
like it's fair even even playing field

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,240
