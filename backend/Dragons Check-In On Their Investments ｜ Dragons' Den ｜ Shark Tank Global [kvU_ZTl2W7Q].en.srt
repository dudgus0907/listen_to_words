00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
In the last four years, Dragon's Den has

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,359
attracted more than 22,000 applications

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,519
from all corners of the UK.

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
This summer, the Dragons are taking time

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,160
out of running their multi-million pound

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
empires, crisscrossing the country,

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
dishing out their infamous brand of

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
nononsense business advice. It's amazing

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
how many people get obsessed with an

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
idea and they keep throwing money at it

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,559
and they keep thinking it's the idea

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
it's going to make them a fortune and

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,280
actually it's pretty obvious it isn't.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
And these are demanding times for

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,440
entrepreneurs. Banks are not lending at

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
the moment. It's one of the extra

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,920
challenges we've got with the recession.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
Tonight, the Dragons embark upon the

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,760
first stage of their journey, traveling

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,879
throughout the South from the West

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,719
Country to Kent. So, we would make 10

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,079
times our money. 10 times your money.

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,879
Can I just tell you guys, that's the

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,879
kind of investment I like.

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,240
The Dragon's Den tour continues onto the

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,119
gentile Georgian spa town of Royal

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
Tundridge, Wales in Kent. The town is

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,759
thought of as representative of Middle

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,479
England with its infamously disgusted

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,880
inhabitants. Now the tour is coming to

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,560
town to visit the studio of entrepreneur

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,680
and artist Guy Portelli.

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,079
In 2008, Guy came into the den asking

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,439
for £70,000 for 25% of his latest work,

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,840
an exhibition of pop icon sculptures.

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,640
Hello dragons. My name is Guy Portelli

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,280
and I am a professional sculptor. I am

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,720
looking for an investment of £70,000 for

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,680
a 25% share in my pop icons collection.

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,040
I intend to use an investment to

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,719
complete a series of 18 sculptures which

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,119
I will then be showing at the

44
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,000
prestigious Mel Galleries in London in

45
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,400
June 2009.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,520
What I am offering is a 25% share of 100

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,800
sculptures. I brought along some pieces

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,800
to show examples of my work.

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,959
This piece is my Grace Jones um that I

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,959
made some 20 years ago.

51
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,200
The John Lennon piece I made six years

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,319
ago and at the time it sold at £1,800.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,640
The Bob Marley is fused with the idea of

54
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,000
the lion of Africa roaring and has

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,879
created a fairly spiritual strong

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,120
element to that work.

57
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,720
This is the new piece. This is the Amy

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,879
Winehouse, my goddess of excess. My work

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,599
is not about caricature.

60
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,720
It's about creating an identity that

61
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,010
relates to youth culture and fashion.

62
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,599
Any questions?

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,239
The den has been transformed into a

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,760
gallery as 51-year-old sculptor Guy

66
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,800
Portelli pitches for £70,000 to fund an

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,190
exhibition of his pop icon sculptures.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Peter Jones is first to quiz the artist

69
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,640
[Music]

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,319
guy. Hello, I'm Peter. Hello, Peter.

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
What's the overall portfolio do you

72
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,480
think in what you're aiming to sell for?

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,159
Well, the whole 100 pieces would have a

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
today value in excess of a million

75
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,000
pounds.

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,319
Um, you would hope to sell them over a

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,959
course of three years

78
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,840
and the the price would go up at least

79
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,480
20% a year. So, what's the hundred

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,360
coming from? The 100 is the additions.

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,040
The the Grace Jones edition of 10. So,

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
we make one, we sell one, we make

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
another one. The John Lennon's edition

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
of 10. We make one, we sell one, we make

85
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
another one. Okay. I mean I have made

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,000
and sold more than a million pounds

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,799
worth of sculpture in the last 10 years.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,680
[Music]

89
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,760
Guy has clarified the deal on offer. Now

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,720
James Khn wants to interrogate the

91
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,720
sculptor on his finances.

92
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
What's the latest piece you've done Amy?

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
The Amy is the most recent work. Okay.

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,479
And what are you selling Amy for? She

95
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,160
was in the gallery recently at 18,000.

96
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
What's the most expensive piece you've

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,840
sold? Um we sold one one recently for

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
28,000 a John Lee Hooker sculpture which

99
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,240
is addition of three. The first one went

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,199
to the Porsche family which I sold seven

101
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,199
eight years ago for £10,000. This one

102
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,639
went for 28 and the next one will sell

103
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,280
for 36. Are you saying that today if

104
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,800
somebody gave you £70,000? Yes. That

105
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,280
would get back 25% of a sale price of

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,199
every sculpture you sold for the next

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,080
100. Yes. Okay. Why? Why? Because I have

108
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,639
never put on a show of this magnitude.

109
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,840
Um, we would expect to sell 40 pieces in

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,639
the first year and then 30 pieces. What

111
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
would those 40 pieces fetch in the first

112
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,680
year? We would be looking to sell

113
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,840
£250,000

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,479
worth £250,000 worth in the first year.

115
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,880
So the investor would get 25% of that

116
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,160
£250,000 which is 625,000. Yeah. So he

117
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,810
practically get his money back in the

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,440
first year. That's the idea.

[Music]

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Guy is showing that on top of his

121
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,199
undoubted artistic skills, he also has

122
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,120
an entrepreneurial brain. Theopetus

123
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,360
wants to drill down further into the

124
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
business plan.

[Music]

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,840
What are you going to do with the money?

127
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,840
The breakdown of the 70,000 is 25,000

128
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,759
for the exhibition

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:02,000
and 45,000 for the cost of materials and

130
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,680
and labor to complete the work. 25,000

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,400
for exhibition. What does that mean?

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, I plan to rent the Mel Galleries

133
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,440
in London, which is a large prestigious

134
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,720
place. It can accommodate 3 to 400

135
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
people. Um, it would be a major show,

136
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,000
major. So, you're going to put your own

137
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:25,160
exhibition on. What commission would

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,160
they normally take? 50%. 50. Yeah. Ah.

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,039
By confessing that a gallery would

140
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,880
normally expect to receive half the

141
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
revenue generated by sales of his

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,000
collection, the dragons have worked out

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,160
Guy is offering them a much lesser deal.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,160
And art lover Deborah Megan has other

145
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
concerns.

146
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
Guy. Hello. I'm Deborah. Deborah, what

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,199
you're doing here is quite simple.

148
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
You're saying, I'm going to take I'm not

149
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,800
going to spend the 50% on the gallery.

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,400
What I'm going to do is I'm going to

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,319
actually get an investor in at 25%. Mhm.

152
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
And think that I can actually do myself

153
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
a better deal. The bit that I worry

154
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,520
you're missing is the fact that when you

155
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,479
pay the gallery the commission, you're

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,720
paying them for their marketing.

157
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,759
Yeah. So, what's your marketing plan?

158
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
How are you going to get people through

159
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
the door? because that's the bit that

160
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
you're completely cutting out when you

161
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,160
cut out a gallery. Um, well, I'd hope to

162
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,319
generate quite a lot of media interest,

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
get a lot of editorial

164
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,639
thing, the great thing with this series

165
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,960
of work is it does attract a lot of

166
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
media interest and it also is

167
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,560
international. You could take the show

168
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,880
to Tokyo, you could take this show to

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Paris, to Berlin and it would mean

170
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,880
something to people.

171
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,880
[Music]

172
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,800
Guy is clearly confident about his

173
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
project, but it's an unusual business

174
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,319
proposition and hard for the dragons to

175
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,960
evaluate their risk. Will Theopetus find

176
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,639
a solution?

177
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,160
If someone was to offer you the money,

178
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,759
would you allow ownership of those 18

179
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,479
pieces

180
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,199
to the person

181
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,280
that gave you the money, the investor?

182
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,599
Yeah. Till they got the investment back.

183
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,879
that wouldn't be a problem. Well, I'll

184
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,120
make you an offer then. I'll give you

185
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,120
the £70,000.

186
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,960
I think the way that Theo minimized the

187
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,599
risk by keeping hold of some of the

188
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,360
pieces, I think was a neat component to

189
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
the deal.

190
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
If it all went wrong, I've got all these

191
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
wonderful bits of art which I can

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
display around my house. Theo's off was

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,000
a very astute move. It gave them that

194
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,519
confidence that they couldn't lose. For

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,039
this to really work, you want maximum

196
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,479
impact out in the market. you want

197
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,560
people to know about it. So, I'd like to

198
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,720
recommend something that is that

199
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,320
you get £70,000

200
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,040
for 25%. Mhm.

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,240
But all of the dragons collectively have

202
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,839
a piece of the pie, but then you've got

203
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,760
five fairly powerful people supporting

204
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,760
this activity in 2009.

205
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Wow. So, it's it's not just a question

206
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,920
to you. It's obviously a question to see

207
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,920
whether the dragons would be interested.

208
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,640
Um,

209
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:22,640
I would be quite interested uh guy to

210
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,000
um follow Peter's theme, which I think I

211
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,640
could probably add quite a bit of value

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,800
to that. Um, I think there's a return to

213
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,800
be made.

214
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,480
It's an astute proposal from Peter Jones

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,720
and James Khn is quick to sign up to it.

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
Will Deborah Megan help make it a clean

217
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,160
sweep?

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,880
I do back artists and I do commission

219
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,160
sculptures. So I I'm in this space, but

220
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,680
I have a very clear line between

221
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
investing

222
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,080
and buying something because I want to.

223
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,760
And for me, this hasn't triggered any

224
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,880
passion or any so whatever. Even if it

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,240
was a five dragon deal, I'm I'm not

226
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,240
going to be investing. So, I'm out.

227
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,120
It's a sudden setback. Now, what will

228
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Duncan Banitine think of Peter Jones's

229
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,279
Dragon Consortium?

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,040
[Music]

231
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,440
I think Dylan before dragons would be

232
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,720
difficult. Yeah.

233
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,959
So, I wouldn't want to participate

234
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,360
before dragons. Yeah. Well, I'm very

235
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,240
happy if people are passionate about

236
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,959
what I do. Um, and if James, Theo, and

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,160
Peter wanted to all put some money in, I

238
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,839
would be thrilled with that team. Um,

239
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,600
Duncan,

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,920
if you feel passionately about it, then

241
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
I'm happy for you as well to be part of

242
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,279
that team. I feel passionate about your

243
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,200
work, guy, but I don't feel passionate

244
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,800
about investing with the team. No,

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
that's the problem. Yeah. So, what I've

246
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
been considering is making you a better

247
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,800
offer. Okay.

248
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm going to make an offer. It's in the

249
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,519
same basis that I would own the 18

250
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,200
pieces until it was sold. But my offer

251
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,079
isn't for £70,000. It's for £90,000.

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,240
That's my offer. It's an offer by me on

253
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,240
my own.

254
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
In a bold move, Duncan Banitine is

255
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,279
trying to steal the deal and distance

256
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,279
himself from his rivals. Guy must now

257
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,760
choose between partnering up with three

258
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,079
dragons or go for the higher cash deal

259
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,079
with one.

260
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,800
It's very generous offer. I mean, I'm

261
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,560
um

262
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,600
astounded. Thank you very much. Um, I

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,399
think three people, three guest lists,

264
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,880
three lots of enthusiasm would be

265
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,600
beneficial to the project.

266
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,560
And if I could have an offer of 80,000

267
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,560
from the three, I would be keen to have

268
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,560
that

269
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,270
[Music]

270
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,279
Yeah, I'm I'm happy. I'm happy. I think

271
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,200
you've got yourself a deal, guy.

272
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,200
Thank

273
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,959
I think Guy won because not only did he

274
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,600
get the investment, he got the three

275
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,440
dragons. What this business really needs

276
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
is introductions of people who

277
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,360
potentially are going to want to buy

278
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,360
that art.

279
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,360
James Khan led the investment team on

280
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,839
behalf of the Three Dragons. So, he's

281
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,240
visiting Guy Studio in Kent to see the

282
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,800
creative process. firsthand. Welcome to

283
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,360
the studio. This is the studio. This is

284
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,040
where it all happens. Wow, that is

285
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,040
phenomenal. What is that? That's the

286
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Jimmyi Hendris one, which um is

287
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
fantastic. Which we're just about

288
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,279
finished. What What would we sell this

289
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,560
for, guy? We're probably looking at the

290
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,639
round about £30,000 upwards. What works

291
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,399
for me? James seems to have a strong

292
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,720
sympathy for the arts. I think he sees

293
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
the way that he runs his business as a

294
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,880
creative process. There's something

295
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
about the concept of art and the

296
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,040
creativity and I suppose because I'm

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
married to an artist, you know, I I

298
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,920
probably find this really stimulating.

299
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Yes. And I I can you just have to stop

300
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
me spending money here. I'm glad I'm an

301
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,279
investor.

302
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
I genuinely believe that guy stuff is

303
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:38,760
very very good. My instinct tells me we

304
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,760
are going to make a profit on this deal.

305
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
Before James' prediction can be

306
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,480
realized, there's still much work to be

307
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,399
done to complete the 18 pieces. So guy

308
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,040
is at the foundry casting part of his

309
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,040
sex pistols creation. It's a massive

310
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,160
project and actually a year is not a lot

311
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,240
for what we aim to achieve.

312
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Since the investment, Guy's been working

313
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,639
full-time and flat out producing the

314
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
collection that he committed to in the

315
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,680
dead.

316
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,530
Molten bronze,

317
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,390
1240°.

[Music]

319
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,010
Yeah, that's worked. Well done. Well

320
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,440
done, mate.

321
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,440
[Music]

322
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,519
One year after Guy stood in the den

323
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
before the dragons, he's now preparing

324
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,440
for the allimportant opening night of

325
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,839
his exhibition. We've done the

326
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
invitations, we've done the mail out, we

327
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,320
work with him on his brochure. So, we've

328
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,990
been very proactive in ensuring that

329
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:50,139
Guy's exhibition goes off with a bang.

330
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,139
[Music]

331
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,040
And this is the last the final piece for

332
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,120
the show. And it's it's quite symbolic

333
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,199
really because the Amy was was really

334
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
the piece that opened the doors to me

335
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,030
getting their opportunity with Dragon's

336
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,529
Dead.

337
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,529
[Music]

338
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
Tonight is the Dragon's Night. They've

339
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,160
put the guest list together. They've got

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,279
the people out of the city. And of

341
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,480
course, these people are potentially

342
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,800
great collectors.

343
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,199
This is a very critical moment for Guy

344
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,440
Portelli. The exhibition is going to be

345
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,040
the make or break of Guy. Let's have a

346
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,240
tour by the artist himself.

347
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,959
What's the price? About 60,000. That's

348
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,920
including BAT. I'm worried about not

349
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,760
selling tonight. We need to get some

350
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
sales on the chart because that will

351
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,360
generate more sales. Is anybody

352
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
interested in buying this magnificent

353
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,639
piece? While two of the Dragon investors

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,880
are busy trying to drum up sales, James'

355
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,920
attention was elsewhere. That is

356
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,360
amazing. In fact, I think it's so good.

357
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,519
Let me just have a quick look.

358
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,680
You missed your mouth. I mean, clearly

359
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,680
it it's amazing. What can I say? Listen,

360
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,480
in these troubled times when your

361
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,880
interest in your money in the bank is

362
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,279
like two and six months, this is a great

363
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,759
investment. Is this going to work? Will

364
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,160
people buy the stuff? Well, that's what

365
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,160
we're going to see.

366
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,040
We invested £80,000.

367
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,880
What's the value of the art here today

368
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,199
that you're displaying? Well, if we sold

369
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,920
all 100 pieces, we would be over £3

370
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,079
million. you'd make 750,000 800,000. So

371
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,519
10 times our money. 10 times your money.

372
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,480
Can I just tell you guys that's the kind

373
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,680
of investment I like.

374
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,680
Art is a fantastic investment. I'm

375
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,440
breaking all the rules. Hopefully other

376
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,720
artists will follow my lead. Hopefully

377
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,399
other investors will invest in artists.

378
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
I shall be thrilled when I can give them

379
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,959
their check back. You know, it'll be a

380
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,360
great relief to me just to say here's

381
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,280
your investment. Thank you very much.

382
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,919
Now, let's move forward.

383
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,400
Since the exhibition, Guy has sold four

384
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,880
pieces for £65,000.

385
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,160
It's a promising start, and Guy is now

386
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,199
looking forward to touring his

387
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,199
exhibition around the world.

388
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,919
A day in the den is very different to a

389
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,799
day in the office for the

390
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,600
multi-millionaires. Good morning. I'm

391
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,600
here to invest some money. Behind the

392
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,440
scenes, the morning starts with a visit

393
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,679
to the glamour department. Well, come

394
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,679
in, get a bit of makeup on, have me

395
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,480
breakfast, then we all wait for Peter

396
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
George. I'm a little bit late, so um I

397
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,360
better go and get my makeup on and get

398
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,360
going. You need some makeup on, mate. I

399
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,000
need some makeup on. I don't have

400
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
makeup. So, we waiting for now. Oh,

401
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
waiting for Peter. No, we're not. We're

402
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
going to change the name of this show,

403
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
by the way. It's no longer be called

404
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,640
Dragon's Den. It'll be called Waiting

405
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,480
for Peter.

406
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,960
If you just focus across to him now,

407
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,960
he's just doing his hair look.

408
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,480
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the

409
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,919
wisest dragon of all?

410
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,280
All right, I'm going to do my hair. You

411
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,280
might not see it on screen. He does

412
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
actually have hair. When they comb his

413
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,960
hair, they do it by strand. That's

414
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,160
actually for hairspray. It actually

415
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,240
sprays hair onto his head. The dragon's

416
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,480
multi-million pound business empires get

417
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,039
put on hold as they eagerly await the

418
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,679
next money-making opportunity. There is

419
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,240
a sense of anticipation because you have

420
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,559
absolutely no idea what's about to

421
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,679
happen. Is Peter Jones going to listen

422
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,520
for a whole half hour. Is Duncan going

423
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
to stay awake?

424
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,559
Is James going to stroke his beard more

425
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
than 32 times a minute?

426
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,200
These are all questions that we need to

427
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,960
know the answer of and we won't know

428
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,000
till we get in that day. After you,

429
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,000
madam. What was it?

430
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,960
Back on the road. The tour is heading to

431
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,280
West Sussex and Hosted Canes, home to a

432
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,280
small ethical packaging company with big

433
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
ambitions.

434
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,840
Rachel Watkin and Christian Richardson

435
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,160
were an unlikely business partnership,

436
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,320
and in 2008, they'd been working

437
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,039
together for 8 months in their fledgling

438
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,640
business. They came into the den asking

439
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,400
for £53,000 for 20% of their company.

440
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
Hi,

441
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
my name is Christian Richardson. This is

442
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,360
Rachel Watin. Uh together we run a

443
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,480
company called the Tiny Box Company. Uh

444
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,799
we've come to you today uh asking for

445
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,360
£53,000

446
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:48,240
for 20% investment in our company. Uh we

447
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,559
are currently the only company in the UK

448
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,799
that solely deals in recycled packaging.

449
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,000
We do all different kinds of boxes. We

450
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,520
do boxes for specifically the gift and

451
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
jewelry sectors. That's what we're

452
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,200
targeting at the moment. To date, we've

453
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:07,240
been trading for about 6 months. Um we

454
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,240
have taken £21,735.

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,640
Um we've sold about 66,000 units and the

456
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,480
reason that we're looking for investment

457
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
is because the packaging industry is

458
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,160
incredibly seasonal along with the gift

459
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,039
in the jewelry market. So most of our

460
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,360
competitors will take between 50 and 80%

461
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,360
of their annual turnover in the 3 months

462
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,640
run up to Christmas. So we need to make

463
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,120
sure that we've got enough money in the

464
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,360
kitty to buy the stock to make sure that

465
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
we've streamlined the operations and we

466
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,360
have the warehouse structure and also

467
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,480
the staff to fulfill the the coming

468
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,080
Christmas market. Um and that's the tiny

469
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
box company. Thank you very much.

470
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,039
Christian, can you hand me a couple of

471
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,120
the boxes? Just let me have a quick

472
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,919
look.

[Music]

474
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,760
Business partners Christian Richardson

475
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,320
and Rachel Watkin need £53,000 for Tiny

476
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,120
Box, their gift packaging company,

477
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,200
dealing only in recycled products. In

478
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,799
return, they're willing to give away 20%

479
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,039
equity.

480
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,679
Deborah Meden wants to grill the pair on

481
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,679
their green credentials.

482
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,240
Hello, Rachel. Hello, Christian. Hello.

483
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,760
Um, you started off by saying you're the

484
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,760
only company that does wholly recycled

485
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,600
boxes or packaging. Yeah. Um,

486
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,200
I that may well be correct. There's

487
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,799
quite a few that do it though, aren't

488
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,280
there? There are quite a few companies

489
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,960
that do recycle packaging. Yes. But not

490
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,440
solely. They're companies that if you go

491
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
on their their website, uh, they are a

492
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,559
packaging company. They do everything,

493
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
but they also do recycle. They have a

494
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,600
little small section for recycled. So,

495
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,120
this isn't a unique you haven't got a

496
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,880
unique product. your unique selling

497
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,919
point is the fact that you are set up as

498
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
a presumably you're you're you're um

499
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,559
focusing on the ethical side of things.

500
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,480
So we solely do it. That's all we do.

501
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,240
What what we discovered we did a lot of

502
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
market research on this and we phoned

503
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
probably about 30 packaging companies

504
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
and we said we're looking for recycled

505
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,120
bags. We're looking for recycled boxes

506
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,720
and the response was the same. Uh oh,

507
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,520
all our products are recyclable. No, we

508
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,520
want recycled. Um and the knowledge

509
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,159
within the companies just wasn't there.

510
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,840
So as a consumer, you know, if I want to

511
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,320
buy recycled packaging, they couldn't

512
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,320
give me the answers.

513
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,919
Rachel may have assuaged Deborah Megan's

514
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,760
concerns, but Duncan Banitine still

515
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,200
seems troubled.

516
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,799
[Music]

517
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,240
Rachel, hi. Why solely recycled? It

518
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,000
started off because I wanted recycled

519
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
packaging for another company I was

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,520
dealing with. Okay. Why did you want

521
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,679
recycled packaging? Because I had a

522
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,760
jewelry business. Uhhuh. Um, and it was

523
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,520
fair trade jewelry and I thought that I

524
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,039
wanted to put it in recycled packaging.

525
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,120
The jewelry business making money. The

526
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,200
the jewelry business, we were focusing

527
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,559
on both businesses. Is the jewelry

528
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,679
business making money? It's a very

529
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,960
simple question. No, the jewelry

530
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,080
business isn't making money and that

531
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,240
because two business is not making

532
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,400
money. No, because we focused on this

533
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,200
full-time. It It sounds to me, Rachel,

534
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,720
that you're on a crusade and crusades

535
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,919
cost money. Excuse me. I'm going to have

536
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
to stop you there because there's no way

537
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,000
that Rachel is is on a crusade. She

538
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,799
started a fair trade jewelry company.

539
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,480
What time in your relationship did you

540
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,440
decide that Rachel couldn't speak for

541
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,640
herself? Sorry.

542
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,799
Is it a crusade, Rachel?

543
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't feel that it's a crusade. Yes,

544
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,440
ethics are important, but I see it as a

545
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,799
as a feasible business model. I think

546
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,039
it's absolutely ridiculous that you come

547
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:36,000
along with what you call a business that

548
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,880
you describe as ethical and recycle

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,960
materials and you produce a box which my

550
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
8-year-old daughter Emily could make

551
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,559
better at school. You know, the ends

552
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,880
don't match up. The lines aren't

553
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,880
straight. You know, it's pathetic. It

554
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
really, really is. So, I'm not

555
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,960
investing. So, I'm out.

556
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,559
It's a crushing blow. A furious Duncan

557
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,200
Banitine has derided the duo's business,

558
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,559
but James Khn is still interested to

559
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,880
find out more. Hi Rachel. Hi Christian.

560
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,799
I'm James. Who who your five biggest

561
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,120
customers that have bought this product?

562
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,679
Uh biggest names we've sold to Google.

563
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,480
We've sold to uh How many units did

564
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,240
Google buy? Uh they've bought 400 units

565
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,039
in the last week. Why would Google buy

566
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,400
these boxes? Corporate gift packaging.

567
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,559
Okay. This is where we're seeing the

568
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,520
market. How did you get to the customer?

569
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,320
They contacted us. Really? Yes. Give me

570
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,400
the others. Uh, Tate Galleries for all

571
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,880
the the shops at Tate Liverpool, Tate

572
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Modern, Tate Britain. Okay.

573
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
It's an impressive client base for such

574
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,840
a young business. But Theopetus is

575
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,159
concerned the couple are ignoring

576
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,159
larger, more lucrative sectors of the

577
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,159
market.

578
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,840
I've got to tell you now I spend several

579
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,520
millions on packaging every year.

580
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,400
So I know a little bit about packaging.

581
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,480
Mhm. You come here saying I want to run

582
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,159
a business. I want investment to run a

583
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,799
business

584
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,760
and then you shackled yourself. Why not

585
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,600
have a recycled side and a non-recycled

586
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,360
side where you can then generate the

587
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,760
income to further your goals and achieve

588
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,320
what you want to achieve. Does that hurt

589
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,640
you? Is there a problem with that? We

590
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,880
recognized a market niche and projected

591
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,679
that okay it's a market niche now but

592
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,279
with with the economic climate climate

593
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,840
the political climate it could be

594
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,279
mainstream tomorrow. I went into it as a

595
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,120
business not as a crusade. I mean, it

596
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,960
does sound a little bit of a crusade.

597
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,760
Hearing such an influential dragon

598
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,440
pouring scorn on their business strategy

599
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,640
doesn't bode well for Christian and

600
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:54,640
Rachel. And unfortunately, there's more

601
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,240
trouble ahead. It's just not for me. I

602
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
understand that you guys are really

603
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,880
passionate and you believe in it, but

604
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,640
it's not a viable business opportunity.

605
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,799
For those reasons, I'm out. But good

606
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,440
luck. Thank you. I'll let you know where

607
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,159
I am. Um,

608
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,520
I like this space, but I'm not going to

609
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,279
make you an offer. And I'm not going to

610
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,520
make you an offer because at the moment

611
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,440
that market is quite small. That's why

612
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,640
packaging companies have a recycling

613
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,440
arm, but people's purchasing is still

614
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,880
driven by price. What does it look like

615
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,799
first and then recycling second? So, I'm

616
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,080
afraid I'm out. Thank you.

617
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,440
Christian and Rachel's bid for £53,000

618
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,000
is looking increasingly fragile. Now

619
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,039
Theopitis wants to pursue the background

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,039
of the entrepreneurs themselves.

621
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,039
What did you do before this? Uh before I

622
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,600
was in packaging. Uh I worked in radio.

623
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,080
Doing what? Uh I was doing radio shows.

624
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,080
You're doing radio shows? Yeah. I worked

625
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,120
for radio station in London called Kiss

626
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,679
100. I've worked for Virgin Radio and

627
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,640
didn't didn't pay well. Uh it paid

628
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,440
fantastically. It paid it played six

629
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,960
figure songs, but you decided to throw

630
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,559
it in. I um I went into rehab um about a

631
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,039
year ago. And when I came out, I wanted

632
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,360
to help people. So I met Rachel

633
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,720
literally 3 days after I got back. We

634
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,799
got talking and um we started working

635
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,400
sort of from the next day. And how long

636
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,960
ago was that? That was July last year.

637
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,679
Okay, Christian, I I guess some of your

638
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,200
story before I asked it, but I can't

639
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,080
guess your story. Okay.

640
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,799
Um, I went to university, studied

641
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,159
business studies, got a job doing um,

642
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,159
financial accounting as a graduate

643
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
trainee for the John Lewis Partnership,

644
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,600
and then ended up working for a large

645
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,159
software house that specialized in

646
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,480
financial software. worked my way up to

647
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,640
become the uh the technical UK sales

648
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,360
manager for that. Then I got sick

649
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
and um got sick. I got sick. I went in

650
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,120
for a routine appendix operation that

651
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,399
went horribly wrong. Picked up a killer

652
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,520
virus in the hospital and lost my job,

653
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,520
lost my house and everything else.

654
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,799
The couple's cander has transformed the

655
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,520
atmosphere in the den. Peter Jones has

656
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,000
been very quiet, but now he's ready to

657
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,000
have his say.

658
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,480
What's really interesting about this

659
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,840
situation is I think this is a very very

660
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,000
good example of actually why business is

661
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,919
as much about the people as it is about

662
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,760
an idea. And when you give your story,

663
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,480
it's resonates with me and it makes me

664
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,320
think actually how can we take these two

665
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,840
clear clearly been through a hell of a

666
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
lot individuals when you different

667
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,480
circumstances your life for whatever

668
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,279
reason you make it very very interesting

669
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,720
and you make yourselves very very

670
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,279
investable actually and it's interesting

671
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,480
now and I'm thinking sitting here how

672
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,200
can I help to make this a business I I

673
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,320
want to make you an offer Um, the reason

674
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,320
why I'm going to make you an offer is,

675
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,399
and I got to say this is the fact that

676
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,200
Theo and I have a very large investment

677
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,679
in a business and that business uses

678
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,399
these products. So for me, my offer

679
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,679
would be conditional on on Theo

680
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,720
partnering and my offer to you is for

681
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,720
40% of the business,

682
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,720
but it's for £60,000,

683
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,720
not 53.

684
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,279
Peter Jones is trying to tie his rival

685
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,840
dragon and business partner in on a deal

686
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,000
with the couple. It means that Christian

687
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,440
and Rachel's only hope of securing their

688
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,840
investment now depends on what Theopitis

689
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,840
says next.

690
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,360
If um I decide to gamble £30,000 of my

691
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,120
children's inheritance,

692
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,120
what do you think you can give back?

693
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,880
I think well Christian will vouch for me

694
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,559
on this. I am a complete workaholic. I'm

695
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,799
incredibly passionate about whatever I

696
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,399
do and

697
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,720
very determined as well. So I'm not a

698
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,720
flake that will be going home at 5:00.

699
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,600
I'll be there until the job is done.

700
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,600
Christian, you worry me.

701
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,000
Are you going to get stuck back into

702
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,919
that lifestyle that you, you know, I was

703
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,799
in that that lifestyle and I was stuck

704
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,960
in in a rat and it had me and for for

705
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,640
many years I thought I was in enjoying

706
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,600
it and I wasn't. My passion isn't with

707
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,760
with boxes. My passion is with

708
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,919
broadcasting and it always had it always

709
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,039
has been. But since I've met Rachel and

710
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,640
for what um for what Rachie stands for

711
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,919
and from what I can see in the business

712
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,760
and the passion and commitment that

713
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,200
Rachel put puts into it, I'm not going

714
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,200
to leave Rachel standing there.

715
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,840
You know, you got to diversify. You got

716
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,279
to probably compromise because if you

717
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,120
want to achieve and then sometimes

718
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,960
you've got to look at a wider picture.

719
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,960
Yeah. To achieve it. Mhm. Um,

720
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,200
so we need that commitment. I'd be happy

721
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,200
to commit to that.

722
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:38,080
I'm in for 30 on the basis of 20%.

723
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,600
Yes, please. We'll take it.

724
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,840
I was so shocked. I didn't know what to

725
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,519
say. I didn't need any time to think

726
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,600
about it. I think we should just bite

727
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,159
their hands off. Do it. Against the

728
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,399
odds, the pair walked away with two new

729
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,679
business partners. But I swear when

730
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,679
Peter said, "I'm making a love," I

731
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,919
looked up. I I kne I nearly my jaw

732
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,399
dropped.

733
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,480
Did I miss something there? Sometimes

734
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,919
it's not all about your idea. It's about

735
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,840
the heart that you have, the drive and

736
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,080
the determination and the focus. I was

737
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,279
touched by the individual,

738
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,200
but we're going to make money out of it.

739
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,159
And that's also exciting.

740
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,640
[Music]

741
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,200
12 months on. Is the company making any

742
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,880
money? Peter Jones is coming to check on

743
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,399
the progress of his and Theo's

744
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,399
investment. Hi Rachel.

745
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,000
This looks great. Yes, it's certainly a

746
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,000
bit bigger. It is a lot bigger, isn't

747
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,919
it? Yeah. These are all our stock

748
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,159
products which we sell largely on the

749
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,000
internet. So around here, the local

750
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,679
businesses donate their boxes to us and

751
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,440
we then use them to send out customers

752
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,360
orders. That's a great idea though. And

753
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,159
more import is good for our bottom line.

754
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,640
It certainly is. In the last year, there

755
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,559
have been big changes to the company and

756
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,519
Christian is no longer taking an active

757
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,320
role. My role in tiny box company now is

758
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,399
very small. I think I realized that my

759
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,039
passion wasn't in recycled or even just

760
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,360
normal boxes. Christian had ambitions to

761
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,600
relaunch his media career and he made

762
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,760
this his priority after his Dragon's Den

763
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,440
experience. After Dragon's Den, there

764
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,679
was a lot of media interest and a lot of

765
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,880
papers calling me up for for for my

766
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,559
story and and what happened. So, I did a

767
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,320
couple of interviews, you know, just

768
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,480
saying, "Well, here's me." Because he

769
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,159
chose to do the interviews, uh, it made

770
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,640
me question as to what his motivations

771
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,399
were, whether it was, uh, to help the

772
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,159
tiny box company or for his career or

773
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,720
I I was struggling to see the benefits

774
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,640
of it. So Rachel has managed the

775
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
expansion of the business and relocation

776
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,519
to their new premises with the support

777
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,840
of her Dragon Business partners.

778
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,440
Well, that was a nice tour. I'm glad you

779
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,840
enjoyed it. Let's get down to some

780
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,840
serious business. It's looking quite

781
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,120
nice, which is I'm not saying I'm

782
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,880
surprised because I know you worked hard

783
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,679
at it. I know you're competent. I know

784
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,679
you're good. What do you need from me?

785
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,480
If you ask me for another load of money,

786
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,760
the answer is going to be no. But

787
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,720
however, however, one of our competitors

788
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,880
in Holland has gone out of business and

789
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,960
in the shippers warehouse at the moment

790
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,879
is 40 pallets of stock. The shippers

791
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,200
have said to us, if we can recover their

792
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,200
costs of four or 5,000, we can have the

793
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,839
stock. So, there's a potential sales

794
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,040
value there about 90 to £100,000. Yeah,

795
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,560
let's buy that. I like it. I tell you

796
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,399
what, Theo's going to regret not coming

797
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,919
here now. That's a huge opportunity. I

798
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,520
think you're doing a really good job and

799
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,359
I'm going to say good luck over the next

800
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,119
week cuz you've got a busy week. I have.

801
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,280
Yes. I'm happy. And I'll speak to you on

802
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,919
Friday about that deal. So, what does

803
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,520
Peter now think about Rachel's business?

804
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,919
Tiny box company. She's got a tiny

805
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,760
business, but she's got big ambition. I

806
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,520
think she's tenacious. She's determined.

807
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,159
She's focused. And actually, I think

808
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
she's going to give it her all. I'm not

809
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,520
sure if we're really going to make it

810
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,200
into a really big business, but I'm

811
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,760
hoping that if anybody can do it, she

812
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,679
can do it.

813
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,680
Show business is big business at the

814
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,480
final stop for this leg of the Dragon's

815
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,480
Den tour. The West End is theaterland,

816
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,240
an ideal place to meet entrepreneurs

817
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,240
with performance at the heart of their

818
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,240
enterprise.

819
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,640
No one could have predicted that opinion

820
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,040
would polarize so rapidly amongst the

821
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,680
dragons when earlier this year Karen

822
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,400
O'Neal and Karen Kums entered the den.

823
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,960
They were offering 25% of their business

824
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,960
for a 100,000 investment.

825
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,400
Hi, I'm Karen. And I'm Karen. And we're

826
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,040
here today to pitch for £100,000

827
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,000
investment for 25% stake in our

828
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,700
business. Ice blading. Learn to ice

829
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,890
skate without the ice. Music, please.

830
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,890
[Music]

831
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Heat.

832
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Heat.

833
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,000
Thank you, girls. Thank you, girls.

834
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,400
Ice blading is a new concept of learning

835
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,960
how to ice skate without the ice. We are

836
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,359
the first in the UK to produce an inline

837
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,839
skate that replicates an ice skating

838
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,920
blade. Unlike any other skate on the

839
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,800
market, ice blading has a progressive

840
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,200
learn to skate system. We see ice

841
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,960
blading as a big opportunity to create a

842
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,359
new craze based on the phenomenal

843
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,280
success of dancing on ice and also the

844
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,680
popularity of the Christmas outdoor ice

845
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,680
rinks. We've got three interlin but

846
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,720
complimentary branches to our business.

847
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,680
One retail, two the fitness industry and

848
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,599
three the education sector. For retail,

849
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,680
we plan to sell our skate and our learn

850
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,680
to skate system. For the fitness

851
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,079
industry, we want to be the first

852
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,000
aerobic fitness class that combines the

853
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,960
skills of ice skating mixed with

854
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,960
aerobics. As for the education sector,

855
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,359
we're currently delivering iceblading in

856
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,040
a number of schools right across London.

857
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,359
We now have an opportunity to go

858
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,760
nationwide as the National Ice Skating

859
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,839
Association has endorsed our product as

860
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,480
part of their national learn to ice

861
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,400
skate program. We hope we're not skating

862
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,560
on thin ice as we really need your

863
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,400
investment to help manufacture our

864
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,040
skate. Thank you for listening.

865
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,200
The two chirpy Karens were people that

866
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,320
you wouldn't want to wake you up every

867
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,200
morning. Having two such enthusiastic

868
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,839
individuals, I think would

869
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,680
make my head explode. We was really

870
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,839
chuffed with ourselves. The girls never

871
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,839
fell over. Everything went according to

872
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,359
plan. Yes. until they started asking

873
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:01,440
questions and then we just died.

874
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:05,000
Panicked. Ladies, hello. Hello. Hello. I

875
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,000
don't know what to say.

876
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,079
Is that good or bad? Well,

877
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,280
inline skating has been around for well

878
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,720
since I was a boy.

879
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,440
What's different between that and the

880
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,079
normal on inline skating?

881
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,960
And what has that got that replicates

882
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,520
that the angles basically it's your

883
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,599
angles. An inline skate is in line and

884
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,640
in a straight line and you can't do any

885
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,480
jumps or spins or any tricks with them.

886
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,359
But with these skates, it's at the same

887
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,119
angle as an ice skate and it's got a toe

888
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,520
stopper. An inline skate has another

889
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,760
wheel in the front there. So you can't

890
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,800
do anything else with an inline skate

891
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,160
apart from go forwards and backwards.

892
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,680
When you've seen people in the park, you

893
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,320
don't see anyone do jumps or stuff. Have

894
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,320
a look at one like that. Yeah. Um

895
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,079
Karen, I'm sorry, Ken. I don't know how

896
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,440
you can see you can't jump. Why? Why

897
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,640
can't you jump? We're all scared. Yeah,

898
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,760
they they do. What you're saying is they

899
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
can't jump in the same way that they can

900
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,079
jump in a nice They can jump off of They

901
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,920
can jump like this kind of jump, but you

902
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,480
couldn't jump off the top of your toe to

903
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,800
to throw it across into the air because

904
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,400
there's nothing to jump off of. Jump off

905
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,680
the top of your toe to throw in the air.

906
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,040
Show me that. What does that mean? to

907
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,400
jump, you have to jump through heel

908
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,480
through toe and you do it in that

909
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,599
position. Or you jump, if you go to

910
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,280
jump, you'd have to jump on your toe and

911
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,839
you couldn't do that on that. No inlines

912
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,240
you can do that on.

913
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,920
It's a promising start for the duo.

914
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,400
They're confident that theirs is the

915
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,680
superior skate and have managed to charm

916
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,880
the dragons. Now, Peter Jones wants to

917
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,880
drill down into their finances.

918
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,280
Girls, hi, I'm I'm Peter. um get down to

919
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,640
some I suppose key questions. What's the

920
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,040
manufacturing cost? What have you got

921
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,240
that down to now? To make if we buy say

922
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,880
10,000 skates is £25 and that's the

923
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,560
whole unit. We're selling them um for

924
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
£125.

925
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,800
And how many are you going to sell year

926
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,320
one? 5,000.

927
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,760
Okay. So, year one you're going to make

928
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,599
half a million pounds. Well, we No,

929
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,200
we've been um in talks with a

930
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,520
distributor which is actually the major

931
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,200
distributor in the whole of the UK. Um,

932
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,960
and they're very very interested in in

933
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,760
our product. We have a letter here as

934
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,000
well. We we hope in year in year two we

935
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,040
make a profit of um Can I stay on year

936
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,480
one? 5,000 units.

937
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,079
What profit are you going to make on

938
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,720
each skate? Um, us £25. You're going to

939
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,720
make £25 for every unit. Yeah. Profit.

940
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,560
Yes.

941
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,760
The initial glitz and glamour is

942
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,000
forgotten as business matters take over.

943
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,550
Duncan Baniti now wants to interrogate

944
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,920
the duo on the size of their market.

945
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,560
[Music]

946
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,119
How many people each year want to learn

947
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,200
to ice skate in Great Britain?

948
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,960
Well, there's 45,000 on the learn to ice

949
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,520
skate program at the moment. So, would

950
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,280
you say 45,000 people in Great Britain

951
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,640
want to learn to ice skate? Well,

952
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,560
there's probably more, but there's only

953
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,720
64 ice rinks in the country. Can you

954
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,040
give us a number? Um, well, Somerset

955
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,520
House this Christmas attracted over

956
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,000
100,000. I can't give you a number. No.

957
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,839
So, you have no idea how many people

958
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,720
there are out there who want to ice

959
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,720
skate who cannot access an ice ring. You

960
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,040
have no idea. No, not that can't access

961
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,040
an ice ring.

962
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,800
Um I I just can't understand this

963
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,119
actually

964
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,160
and I can't see this being a big seller.

965
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,040
Okay. So, for that reason. Okay. Thank

966
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,040
you. Thank you.

967
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,440
Duncan Banitine's assessment of their

968
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,520
business's potential comes as a blow to

969
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,119
Karen and Karen.

970
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,119
Will Deborah Megan see more promise?

971
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,599
Um, hello Deborah. Can you tell me about

972
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,319
this scheme that you've got going on

973
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,720
with schools? Well, we're we're teaching

974
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,560
them the ice blading syllabus. It's a

975
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,560
progressive learn to ice skate. So, you

976
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,280
go into a school Yes. And then you

977
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,560
invite pupils free of charge. No, some

978
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,119
schools, we've got private schools,

979
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,560
we're paying up to £120 per session. So

980
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,000
at the moment, you're all you are

981
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,079
retailing, you're not retailing the

982
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,400
goods, but you are retailing your time

983
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,000
and you are running these sessions. So

984
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,240
tell me about that model. That might

985
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,240
help me understand how much cash you're

986
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,480
actually generating. Okay. Well, we've

987
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,440
got 25 sessions a week at the moment in

988
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,440
schools. We charge from average price is

989
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,160
70 to1 £120. So, how much cash have you

990
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,480
generated so far? In five in um nearly

991
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,560
six months, we've generated uh 205,000.

992
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,079
This doesn't really sound like a very

993
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,400
attractive business proposition because

994
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,280
one of the key issues for me is I'm not

995
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,359
sure really there's a big enough market

996
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,119
for this. Well, there's quite a lot of

997
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,640
vice rings that are under repair at the

998
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,480
moment. There's about four that's

999
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,000
actually going down for Doesn't mean

1000
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,240
anything to me. No, but they want the

1001
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,440
show to go on. Okay. Let me ask you a

1002
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,520
question. How many did you sell last

1003
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,520
month? Like I said, we're only in

1004
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,280
business six. How many did you sell last

1005
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
month? I have another I have another

1006
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,680
letter. How many did you sell last

1007
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,119
month? I haven't sold any to date, but

1008
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,240
we have letters from retailers here.

1009
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,560
Okay. Now, I appreciate. So, you see

1010
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,839
what I'm saying? When when somebody

1011
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,280
sells tells me they've sold nothing and

1012
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,319
they make up numbers of 5,000, 10,000,

1013
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,079
20,000, it just sounds ridiculous.

1014
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,079
There's no substance there.

1015
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,319
When the two Karens were giving me their

1016
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,359
cute little one lines, it didn't do

1017
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,280
anything for me. I didn't get them. I

1018
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,040
didn't get the product and I didn't get

1019
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,800
the business opportunity. So,

1020
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,839
regrettably, I'm out and therefore I

1021
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,400
couldn't say I'm out quick enough. Peter

1022
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,920
Jones was equally damning. This is

1023
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,400
ridiculous and painful. I think you've

1024
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,680
been very naive um to think that you've

1025
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,839
got a business that's anything like

1026
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,839
valued at £300,000. You have a business

1027
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,960
that's valued at zero and I'd even

1028
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,800
question that. Um it's nothing but a

1029
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,640
little idea in your head. Um I can't

1030
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,640
invest in ideas in heads and that's why

1031
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,520
I'm out. Okay. Thank you. I never in my

1032
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,359
head thought I'm going to give up.

1033
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,319
You're still in. You still got to shout.

1034
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,640
That's just my attitude, my mentality.

1035
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,560
Just two dragons now remained. Deborah

1036
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,160
Megan and the unusually subdued

1037
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,400
Theopitis.

1038
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,119
Only now was he ready to question them

1039
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,480
on their key industry contacts.

1040
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,480
You said it had been approved. Yes. Yes.

1041
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
We can't believe it. We also But the

1042
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,079
National Ice Skating Association and it

1043
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,599
can be used as a training aid for ice

1044
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,680
skating. Yes, it's an off ice training

1045
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,839
aid and fundamental skating. You know,

1046
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,160
we you can learn to skate anywhere in

1047
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,240
the park. It works really well in

1048
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,800
leisure centers who have got um ice

1049
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,200
rinks because ice hockey takes up a lot

1050
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,319
of time and it works really well if as

1051
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,599
long as you've got space. It works

1052
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,319
really well in leisure centers who've

1053
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,720
got biz space and uh the sport England

1054
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,640
survey for children ice skating came out

1055
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,200
as the top three sports that they want

1056
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,720
to do. So any is there any reason why

1057
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,480
you shouldn't just buy yours and forget

1058
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,880
buying inline skates? Yeah, because you

1059
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,480
can do more you can do more on ours than

1060
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,560
you can do on an inline skate. People go

1061
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,240
around the park with their inline skates

1062
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,000
and all their helmets and everything and

1063
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,920
then they lose interest because it

1064
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
doesn't go anywhere. Okay. So, before we

1065
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,000
go any further, you did say you had a

1066
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,440
letter from uh a distributor. Yes. And a

1067
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,960
letter from the National Arc Skating

1068
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,040
Association. Yes. Have you got those

1069
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,040
with you? Yes. Can I have them? Yes, you

1070
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,880
can. Thank you. I very rarely make

1071
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,800
excuses for people in the den when they

1072
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,200
don't know the numbers.

1073
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,920
But I think the girls got such a pasting

1074
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,520
from some of the other dragons unfairly.

1075
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,880
I think a might have struggled with

1076
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,960
those numbers as well. You know, we must

1077
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,200
say, Theo, we've done all of this in 4

1078
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,720
weeks.

1079
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,960
Amazing.

1080
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,800
Is he about to offer them the financial

1081
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,800
lifeline they badly need?

1082
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,800
Okay.

1083
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,160
Right, ladies. I'm going to make you an

1084
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,599
offer. Mhm.

1085
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,319
For the full £100,000.

1086
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,520
And I won't be wanting 25% of the

1087
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,359
business. Mhm. Okay. I'll be wanting 45%

1088
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,160
of the business because I don't believe

1089
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,920
the business is worth anything near that

1090
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,280
level at the moment. I could be burning

1091
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,119
my money just like that.

1092
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,280
And you're going to need a lot of help

1093
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:40,160
to get this to market. Yes. Are we in?

1094
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,640
When Theo made the offer, I was like,

1095
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,119
"Oh, thank God for that. Someone's got

1096
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,560
us out of this,

1097
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,240
I felt really, really good. Really,

1098
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,480
really happy." Really? But you wouldn't

1099
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,440
have known we did cuz we were just so

1100
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,760
Yeah. I really want Yeah. I was battered

1101
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,760
and bruised.

1102
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,599
Fantastic. Great. We're in.

1103
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,560
You know, I'm going to love working with

1104
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,800
these ladies, but unfortunately for

1105
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,480
them, they've got a much larger task

1106
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,880
ahead of them than they could have

1107
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,160
possibly imagined when they accepted the

1108
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,160
investment from me.

1109
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,079
I'm very pleased with that. I'm ecstatic

1110
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,880
with it. Somebody's put something in

1111
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,440
Theo's water earlier today that has made

1112
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,560
him turn into one of the Chuckle

1113
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,480
Brothers. I was blown away when James

1114
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,720
put his money into doggy treadmill. I

1115
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,920
think Theo could have made the second

1116
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,319
most ridiculous investment in the denim

1117
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,760
on that one. You don't know.

1118
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,680
I listened and um trying to find an edge

1119
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,480
cuz that's what the den's all about is

1120
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,160
getting that edge. Do you know you are

1121
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,319
our chosen dragon? Peter, I was their

1122
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,319
first choice. All right. Just thought

1123
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,400
I'd tell you that.

1124
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,760
Lovely. Well done again.

1125
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,520
Thank you. Congratulations. Brilliant.

1126
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,680
Thank you for saving us. I'm really

1127
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,760
looking forward to it.

1128
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,839
Just 5 and a half weeks after shaking

1129
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,680
hands in the den, Theo's heading to

1130
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,400
London's West End to catch up with the

1131
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,560
Karens. But before the entrepreneurs

1132
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,720
receive any money, there's due diligence

1133
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,520
to consider. The allimportant patent

1134
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,079
needs to stand up. And Theo has another

1135
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,400
requirement for them to fulfill.

1136
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,359
I made my offer conditional. conditional

1137
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,280
on a world expert telling me it was just

1138
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:33,800
like ice skating. Ice skating on wheels.

1139
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,800
Let's just find out if it really works.

1140
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,720
The retail magnate has many skills, but

1141
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,640
ice skating isn't one of them. So, he's

1142
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,720
called in a favor from a friend,

1143
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,960
ex-Olympic figure skater and one-time

1144
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,200
chairman of the ice skating association,

1145
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,200
Hey Gunen.

1146
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,240
Karen and Karen are still waiting for

1147
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,319
the final components of their finished

1148
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,920
product to be delivered. So Theo and

1149
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,280
Hake have been watching the dancers

1150
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:03,680
using a prototype skate. But will Hey be

1151
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,800
impressed with their design. Hello.

1152
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,599
Nice to see you again. Can I introduce

1153
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,240
you this guy? Don't have to. Is he our

1154
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,280
skating royalty? Is he

1155
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,720
Oh my word. Wow. I mean this is where it

1156
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,640
really changes from the inline blade,

1157
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,599
doesn't it? Completely. What I love is

1158
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,680
that you've taken a real blade. Exactly.

1159
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,599
And maintained the toe pit and the

1160
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,440
rocker allows you to move on just one

1161
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,000
roller at a time or one and a half.

1162
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,800
Right. Yeah. What I've seen mirrors

1163
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,520
almost identical what we do on the ice.

1164
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,359
It's an unusual form of due diligence.

1165
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,200
Time to find out if they'd passed

1166
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,359
Hunen's test. Well, ladies, of course, I

1167
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,119
had a chat with Hagen.

1168
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,839
Would you like to know what he told me?

1169
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,520
Yes, of course.

1170
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,480
This is a dragon's den face. Yeah, we've

1171
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,640
seen this face before.

1172
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,640
He loved it. Oh, that's brilliant.

1173
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,160
That's brilliant. He absolutely loved

1174
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,920
it. And now we got to deal with

1175
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,480
condition number two. It's out of our

1176
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,480
hands that one.

1177
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,480
Okay. So, we won't know until they all

1178
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,640
come back whether they stand or not.

1179
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,880
Because what we're not going to do is

1180
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,760
manufacture hundreds and hundreds of

1181
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,400
thousands of skates and then find we're

1182
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,000
infringing somebody's patent and have to

1183
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,160
destroy them. In the meantime, we need

1184
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,400
to get all the paperwork sorted out.

1185
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,760
Yeah. Get the money ready to go. Mhm.

1186
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,760
And then I think we might have a

1187
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,880
business. Take over. And we're rolling.

1188
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,200
We're rolling. I like that. I like that.

1189
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,599
We're rolling. Let's get on the road,

1190
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,000
ladies. The girls have proved to me that

1191
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,520
this works. So, one of the biggest

1192
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,680
hurdles we've now overcome. Yippee.

1193
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,079
It's one more step down the line. That

1194
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,160
That's good, isn't it? Much better at

1195
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,400
the whole project and we will get there

1196
00:50:50,160 --> 00:51:05,999
and get ready to go.
