[Music]

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,319
stop what was the first person who tried

50
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,060
to milk a cow what were they doing

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,900
honestly what were they up to I feel

52
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,900
like Loki

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,700
like in the human in like the nature of

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,620
a cow like they're not their milk's not

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,540
for us it's for their babies so I feel

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,780
like the First Farmer kind of just saw

57
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:54,000
like a baby cow leech on to a moment and

58
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,739
then like oh damn

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
you could utilize that just like the

60
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,840
baby cow yeah I was on some weird [ __ ] I

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,700
think that was why he but also the weird

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,700
thing is in order for him to know that

63
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,940
if Cinderella's shoe fit perfectly why

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,180
is it falling off in the first place

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,860
[ __ ] her keep your damn shoes on like

66
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,140
why she's just trying to hook up with

67
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,420
some [ __ ] guy at the castle she

68
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,519
thought she was all that I'm sure of it

69
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,900
she thought she was all that her shoe

70
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,700
fit perfectly she kicked it off because

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,980
she's like ooh she wasn't confident

72
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,780
enough to go go up to the guy and she's

73
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,819
just like I'll just lose my shoes oh

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,379
[ __ ] and that's what I don't like about

77
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,420

that's what you want the story to be but

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,120

82
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,379
like damn girl

as interesting well it would have been

85
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,260
better if she wore shoes that didn't fit

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,680

96
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,940
place no like she cut up the thing where

97
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,139
she just didn't and they kind of just

98
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,000
found each other in her eyes like damn

99
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,800

104
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,300
he's like you know what I'll get you

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,300
some shoes that fit so that way let's

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,100
start our love Yeah and show that no one

107
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,840
else can get her shoes but [ __ ] her

108
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,120
she's on some fake show she was the fit

109
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,400
kicking them off ruining the story

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,400
yeah I don't know I just I'm not a fan

111
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,020
what would happen if Pinocchio said my

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,020
nose is about to grow right now

113
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,960
hold on

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,180
if he was lying my nose is about to grow

115
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,979
right now he'd have to say that after

116
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,380
lying because then it'd be the truth and

117
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,300
then his nose wouldn't grow but it would

118
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,520
have grown from the lie so him saying oh

119
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,460
my nose is about to grow right now would

120
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,440
be the truth because he just lied so

121
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,479
he'd have to lie right before saying

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,820
that for that to be true but if he said

123
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,220
that and his nose if he didn't tell a

124
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,320
lie right before it was his nose would

125
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,600
have grown because he'd be lying he'd be

126
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,800
like oh my God no if he said my nose is

127
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,800
about about to grow

128
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,150
see that's that's the thing it's not a

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,300
lie if it grows

130
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:47,759
[Laughter]

131
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,020
I feel like he died hey was he puppet my

132
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,680
nose all of his limbs would fall apart

133
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,960
hey hey my nose is about to grow right

134
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,300
now he'd die and then if it doesn't grow

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,919
he's a liar so it would have to grow but

136
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,720
then if it does grow he's telling the

137
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,880
truth but in order for it to grow he

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,900
means a lot

139
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,820
twice or something maybe that would just

140
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,620
break him who did it like grow twice or

141
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,440
grow not as long or gross I don't know

142
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,300
how long you should ask somebody oh my

143
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,400
God I think he'd kill him I seriously

144
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,720
think he'd kill him like if he made a

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
puppet team that you know that one audio

146
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,120
like the Roblox character I'm pretty

147
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,500
sure like dying not the oh but the Lego

148
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,180
like yeah like the crunches that's what

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,280
happened like Pinocchio would be like my

150
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,319
nose about to grow and then he just like

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,460
like his limbs at all but I think he die

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,840
I seriously think okay that's crazy

153
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,680
yeah stop breathing I'm not trying to

154
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,960
shut up and drive drive drive could you

155
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,600
stand backwards on a flight of stairs

156
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,120
yes yeah which way

157
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,860
could you stand backwards on a flight of

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,880
stairs you'd just be going down the

159
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,880
stairs

160
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,560
no you could be going up no if you were

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,620
standing backwards on a flight of stairs

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,720
it would backwards is technically just

163
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,419
the opposite of the way you were just

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,800
that's true like if I go down an aisle

165
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,360
and then get like brownie mix or

166
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,400
something and then I go back the other

167
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,740
way I'm technically going back from

168
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,660
where I came forward oh it could be

169
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,419
backwards that's not backwards though

170
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,160
because you're going straight through

171
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,900
so if you walk backwards down the stairs

172
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
it's the equivalent of walking backwards

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,940
after getting brownie mix can you stand

174
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,800
backwards on the stairs [ __ ] you yes no

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,620
you can't stick cause then you just go

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,180
walk them either way whatever Direction

177
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,520
you're facing on the stairs front or

178
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,979
back you could do something with that so

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,440
there's you like it's impossible same

180
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,340
thing with an out for the [ __ ] aisle

181
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,340
at a grocery store

182
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,099
if you went halfway down an aisle at a

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,960
grocery store and then turned around and

184
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,060
went backwards the rest you're going

185
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,520
backwards so if you go upstairs six

186
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,860
steps turn around and go upstairs six

187
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,599
more steps you're going backwards up the

188
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,520
stairs so if you go up six and then turn

189
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,259
around and stand still you are standing

190
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,199
backwards on those no but Nick here's

191
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,639
what you're saying stand there's no if

192
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,139
you go up six turn around you're

193
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,020
backwards like there's no movement

194
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,580
involved you're standing still so you

195
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,680
could be backwards at the the [ __ ]

196
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,240
eye the eye of the beholder like the

197
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,400
person watching you won't know that

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
you're backwards correct that's all it

199
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,620
is but yes you could

200
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,360
no you can't you can't because you can't

201
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,520
stand back stand backwards on an aisle

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,979
yes

203
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,379
incorrect now that one you can because I

204
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:31,620
always have an end to him wrong yes

205
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,659
wrong no aisles there's a start and a

206
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,219
finish to an aisle wrong yeah but either

207
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,719
way it could be the start right right

208
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,880
yeah [ __ ] you the same so it's the same

209
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,320
thing so basically shut the [ __ ] up [ __ ]

210
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,760
yourself the question is literally

211
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,800
the question is literally if someone saw

212
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,060
you standing could they tell if you're

213
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,860
going backwards or not the answer is

214
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,540
always going to be no unless you give

215
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,420
them a little bit of context okay next

216
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,320
shut up so [ __ ] that question literally

217
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:01,320
how is it even possible

218
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,200
that the world is in debt

219
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,540
I [ __ ] money I don't believe it I never

220
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,160
who do we owe money to

221
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,019
just like the government owe money to

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,220
itself maybe Mother Nature is like in

223
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,040
order for me to keep revolving around

224
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,320
the Sun I need a kadillion US Dollars

225
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,640
yeah but what is your crazy money's just

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,860
kind of like bartering with special

227
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,720
paper

228
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,459
like remember in like Mayan days like

229
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Egyptian when they just like trade like

230
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,500
a jar for some cacao beans or something

231
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,779
and that would be it like when did we

232
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,760
get strictly paper and then this is the

233
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,440
most valuable thing this is what I think

234
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,420
it's because it's like point I feel like

235
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,580
it's like I think it's all a system yeah

236
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,880
we turn something that's so invaluable

237
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,860
so so valuable yes like what is the cost

238
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,240
of a dollar bill to make you want to

239
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,800
hear it you wanna hear the thing that's

240
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,720
a good question that is a good question

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,720
oh my God how do you pay for money

242
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,500
a dollar

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,580
watch out the chills oh my God because

244
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,779
that's the problem with the penny and

245
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,700
why they were trying to the Penny's

246
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,320
endangered and they were it was gonna go

247
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,640
extinct

248
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,820
because they were apparently it cost

249
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,399
seven seven point five cents to print a

250
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,339
one dollar bill oh so technically that

251
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,320
one dollar bill is

252
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,720
wouldn't that be creating that no it's

253
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,060
not Matt it's not whatever math you're

254
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,459
about to do it's a hundred no it's not

255
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,140
no it's not because the second you have

256
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,120
a dollar it is worth a dollar because

257
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,560
you're not paying the cost overhead to

258
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,040
make it you're not paying the cost of

259
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,660
goods correct the bill

260
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,660
well apparently it's a twenty dollar

261
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,540
bill comes 13.8 cents well I'm just

262
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,980
confused I don't get it dude get rid of

263
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,779
the penny because the penny costs like

264
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,120
more than a penny to make it costs like

265
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,680
a penny and a half

266
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,000
what yeah that's why the penny was

267
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,920
extinct how much it does it costs you

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
really care about the penny no it's just

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,260
like I remember this the penny was in

270
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,260
the customer they cost 2.1 cents what

271
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,320
so who's doing it like the government

272
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,040
that's why we're in so much debt we keep

273
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
making

274
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,500
pieces like oh so oh my God so if we

275
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,560
stop making pennies and solve a lot of

276
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,720
problems but I love pennies I feel like

277
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,720
Abraham Lincoln on the penny yeah I love

278
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,339
