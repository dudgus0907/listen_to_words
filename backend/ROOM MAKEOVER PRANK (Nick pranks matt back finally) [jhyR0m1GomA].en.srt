for a while now it's mostly Nick's idea

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,440
well cuz it's payback because of the

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,799
bird prank that I never got revenge a

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,799

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,760
a lot of plans but they

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,480

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,520
saying nothing when I'm post to with

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,079
Matt has a favorite actor and his name

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,360
is Liam niss if you're not familiar he's

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,760
been in movies like nonstop taken I

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,719
think Star Wars and that's what he looks

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,079
like but anyway Star Wars I think so

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,160
Matt stays in his room very often so he

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,280
doesn't he hasn't noticed the absurd

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,719
amount of packages me and Nick have been

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,199
receiving but we've been buying him

23
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:03,159
bedroom decor covered in Liam niss so

24
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:07,640

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,840
and Vermont and we're going to take it

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:32,240
down and replace it with Mr n in nonstop

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,159
in nonstop gun drawn leaping through the

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,520
air ready ready to fire Matt right now

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,439
has a boring Basic Black comforter on

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,560
his bed which I decided it'd be nice if

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,560
we spice it up with e with a

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,759
gun obviously if he has a blanket he

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,399
needs a pillow right so right now he has

39
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
boring basic black pillows that don't

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,680
worry about it we're going to replace

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,360
them with so much spunk we got Liam niss

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,640
outside

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,000
there he is Matt also obviously he has

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,880
some graphic te's that me and Chris

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,319
decided to take the pleasure of

46
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,360
replacing with shirts to have Liam niss

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,640
on them so we have this nice black one

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,200

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,560

200
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,440
go hey I'm covered in Liam niss I think

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,680
a really underrated spot to put one on

202
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,399
the back of his door you know cuz when

203
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,000
he's alone in his room that spot's going

204
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,800
to look a little empty

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,519
so we got to make sure there's a couple

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,120
actually one was better than one Liam

207
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,720
niss two Liam niss this one just already

208
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
fell Chris is not taking these

209
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,920
well I feel like we got to get higher up

210
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,800
what if we cover here's the rest but we

211
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,800
have to move cuz I just stuck all these

212
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,000
together so we have to like kind of undo

213
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,920
them that's fine I'm thinking covering

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,560
the Alum cover

215
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,000
like putting Mr

ceiling we have to the last

224
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,040

226
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,279
Vlog from that way and I'll Vlog like

227
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,160
from this way okay so that way we get

228
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,240
like full reaction as he comes in and

229
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,320
his room cuz like say he opens the door

230
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,480
like slightly like this I want to catch

231
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,040

finished setting this up we're going to

238
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
sit down and wait in his room and stock

239
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,200
his location and basically what we're

240
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
going to do spend until he gets home for

241
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,800
the next 6 minutes is if any of these

242
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680

244
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,519
