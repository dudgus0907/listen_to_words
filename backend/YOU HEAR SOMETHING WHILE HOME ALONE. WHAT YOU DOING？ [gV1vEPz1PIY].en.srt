00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,440
up in my dream still I literally checked

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,040
interrupted a stage performance I woke

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,560
up like three times in my dream and I

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,560
was on drugs in my dream and not only

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,840
that but just the confusion I felt about

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,879
like where the [ __ ] am I what's

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,599
happening my nose still hurts I was so

78
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,640
confused in my dream it was actually

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
mindblowing that's insan so much and

80
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,599
I've never had a dream where like I did

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,959
something and it's not correct in the

82
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,760
perspective of like what was actually

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,080
going on what did you eat last night I

84
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,200
don't know I just should have I think it

85
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,159
I think it was my sleep I think diet and

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,879
what you eat and what you do before you

87
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,239
sleep and then how much you sleep has a

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,480
big role in what you drink probably why

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,560
you have crazy drinks it definitely was

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,400

entire life had a dream where I was like

182
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
think of that being naked in a bush

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
that's really frightening I'd like get

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,319
out of the water what if there was like

185
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,199
bugs and stuff oh or like dirt I'd get

186
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,280
out of the water and I'd run over to

187
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,000
sand and roll around in the sand and

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,039
cover myself in sand so I don't look

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,720

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,960
cover them and then that what would you

194
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,039
do if you went into a public restroom

195
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,440

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,360
home from Florida one year and it was

202
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,240

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,840
years old and I went to the bathroom I

204
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,919
took a [ __ ] and there was no toilet

205
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,919
paper

206
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,800
left so I used my underwear as toilet

207
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,759
paper and then just threw them away in

208
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,440
the bathroom and you're gross how what

209
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,280
else I supposed to do gross you're gross

210
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,960
you're gross I just took my underwear

211
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,360
fully off used it as toilet paper and

212
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,240
then just put my sweatpants on once

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,919

214
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,759

215
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,800
was none in the bathroom like I

216
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,120
literally looked underneath like nothing

217
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
I have a semi- gross answer go ahead if

218
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,000
there's no one in the bathroom that's my

219
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,639
situation if there's no one in the

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
bathroom I'd literally get up and walk

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,560
to another Stall oh imagine getting

222
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,840
caught and then sit back down and use

223
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,120
the toilet paper in that stall dude yeah

224
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,400
that's a good that's a good move

225
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
honestly you have to be quick cuz you

226
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,759
can't get caught if there's no one else

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
I just really quickly switch dos yeah I

228
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,720
agree like naked just run over I'd

229
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,840
probably do the same thing Nick just

230
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,280
said like get up and go to another stall

231
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,800
or if there somebody is in there and

232
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,680
you're be like hey you got to do me a

233
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,520
favor here yeah oh I I would feel so

234
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,199
uncomfortable asking a stranger but if

235
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,440
someone had to ask someone it should be

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,759
me like I'd just be so polite about it

237
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,000

the room over a toilet flushing the

283
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
scariest one is just music playing like

284
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,120
imagine you were sitting in our house in

285
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
the living room and then up from Nick's

286
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,240
room Just Like Music started playing the

287
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,959
TV turning on that's not that's

288
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,480
paranormal something with electricity

289
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,680
doesn't really bother I'm really scared

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,360
of like that stuff no music fully

291
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,519
playing like a record player or

292
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,000
something okay could you think you're in

[ __ ] one of my favorite artist like

296
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,000
Travis Scott or like a rapper you know

297
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,120
what I mean like rap music can't

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,160
randomly play for me to be inflicted in

299
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,160
fear it needs to like slow jazz like

300
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,920
something you've never heard before like

301
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,120

00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,680
like you kind of fall apart and you were

309
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,880

past year got a knife and stab them I'm

326
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,560
calling the police again I'd call the

police or immediately prepare for

328
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,639
self-defense like don't don't even a lot

329
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,000
of the times in movies when people are

330
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,200
so stupid and they catch you reading

331
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,639
that and they say oh you weren't

332
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,880
supposed to see that sorry no no in

333
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,720
movies stop looking at me like in movies

334
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,519
the usual like thing that happens like

335
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,440
you supposed to see that the person

336
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,160
finds out and then they try to like play

337
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,600
along and like call the police you know

338
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,320
what I mean like they pretend that they

339
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,120
didn't see it and let like 10 minutes

340
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,279
pass while them and the person just

341
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,079
normally inter act it's like I'm not

342
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,600
giving that person any second chances

343
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
like they come back in the room I'm

344
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,440
hitting them with like a baseball bat

345
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
off the head like right okay but the

346
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,600
thing is I'm not going to pretend I

347
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,399
didn't see it if you had to live with it

348
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,920
constantly being daytime or constantly

349
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,760
being nighttime what would you pick

350
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,760
daytime daytime but I'd make sure that

351
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,120
my house has like several rooms that are

352
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,800
just completely black out that's so

353
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,440
weird I kind of that's so weird I kind

354
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,720
of agree with that right daylight but I

355
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,600
just make sure that there's like at

356
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,519
least two or three rooms I can go fully

357
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,639
blacked out ful agree with see I would

358
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,839
just pick daytime and then wait for the

359
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,600
cloudy days to become my true self well

360
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,639
that's not going to happen cuz it's

361
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,240
constantly Sunny it could still be I

362
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,240
agree I agree with Nick because it's not

363
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,120
daytime it's not sunny it's not like

364
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,839
bright or dark it's sunny or it's

365
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,639
daytime or night time like it can rain

366
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,519
still like rain oh yeah I pick daylight

367
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
for sure I I'd pick a day which is

368
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,360
surprising for me cuz I normally love

369
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,040
night time it's easier to

370
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,760
replicate dark than it is the light of

371
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,519
the

372
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,399
Sun that has deeper meaning to it it's

373
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,480
easier to become a follower and not a

374
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,360
leader it's easier to become Darkness

375
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,800
than the light correct it's easier to be

376
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,240
dark and rude than become bright in the

377
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,240
light you know what I mean it's easier

378
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,920
to get on the train of hate of be like

379
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,959
oh we hate that you know it's easier to

380
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,320
join the Dark Side but to get the light

381
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,120
you have to it's easier to replicate

382
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,519
that was a deep message can we all give

383
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,079
him a round of applause that was a deep

384
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,560
M message deep message deep message

385
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,000
thank you God that was a beautiful

386
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,519
message very deep message I feel like

387
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,399
Nick if he was in like a movie he'd be

388
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,320
like the mechanic that like starts under

389
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,639

390
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
skate yeah yeah what the [ __ ] are you

they need the information from for sure

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,199
like oh you got to ask old Randy and

394
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,600

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,600
more if I can't see like I just want to

413
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,560

424
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,199
[ __ ] goof no but like they were like

425
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,399
and then they started like steaming and

426
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,480
like you can notice like a a screw in

427
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,480
their neck that would have to that's one

428
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
of those things that would have to

429
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,680
happen for me they just were a robot the

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,959
whole time I don't know dude do they die

431
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,639
indefinitely no no you have to recharge

432
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,440
them I'm not charging them who the [ __ ]

433
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,680
came up with

434
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,360
LED what does that even mean LED lights

435
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,720
I thought you saying Ellie like Ellie

436
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,759
Golding and that stop

437
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,600
me I thought you were to sing a song

438
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,040
Nick what are you saying why does pizza

439
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,399
come in a square box if it is cut into

440
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,600
triangles I've never seen a circular box

441
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,600
it would make zero sense if a pizza

442
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,240
perfectly fit in the Box yeah you need

443
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,920
cuz you need some leverage to open just

444
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,000
because all pizzas are circular doesn't

445
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,639
mean they're all the same Circle imagine

446
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,160
a pizza box and like the crust and the

447
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,079
ends were like fit like folding over

448
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,639
that's happened to me before no it has

449
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,360
not swear in my life it has I've had a

450
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,600
pizza too big for the Box oh tell too

451
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,600
big for the Box

452
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,240
hey did you love it no you know what I

453
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,680
mean fully did you ever did you ever see

454
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
there was this Criminal Minds episode

455
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
and the guy just did a bunch of

456
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,440
robberies and murders and stuff but he

457
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,959
wore high heels and different ones so

458
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
then they kept thinking he was like a

459
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,959
different height like he was oh a 6'4

460
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,920
man robbed the bank in Westchester

461
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,560
whatever and it was like oh someone

462
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,079
robbed a bank over here but he was only

463
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,000
5T and then he just kept like wearing

464
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,319
different variations he yes like he

465
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,560
would Rob hot platforms whatever you

466
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,440
know what the [ __ ] I mean well high

467
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,519
heels is crazy what's he like strutting

468
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
in yes he is Oh I thought I thought he

469
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
was fully doing I thought he had like

470
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,639
stilettos on

471
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,560
while what you said exactly the guy just

472
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,279
like kept robbing the banks but like he

473
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,920
was a different height every time so

474
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,720
were there high heels or platforms cuz

475
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,120
that's actually shut up they could have

476
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,800
been boots that's what I'm asking

477
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,680
platforms I doubt I doubt they were no

478
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,279
but it was like the same shoe every time

479
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,360
it was just a different like like so

480
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,160
definitely not high heels there's no way

481
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,279
he no it wasn't actual high heels I told

482
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,120
you this we addressed it a minute ago

483
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,000
MadAss he told him to shut up no you

484
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
shut up you're an idiot it was a good

485
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,519
[ __ ] question no there there no

486
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
question shut it was a good thing it was

487
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,440
a good story good for you great every

488
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,799
single time you would rob the bank he

489
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,799
would have different height shoes on wow

490
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,039
so cool thanks I know I think that's

491
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,720
crazy thank you it is pretty cool but I

492
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,079
just what the one deciding factor being

493
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,280
height is like well it's like if

494
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,839
someone's robbing a bank and they're

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
fully in a disguise what really can you

496
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,360
tell the police oh they were fully in a

497
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,079
disguise correct and you pray to God to

498
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,280
find in that dumpster catch him lacking

499
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,959
