stni triplets career and I'm not even

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,359
joking probably in the past 3 years this

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,960
is the biggest if we are ever going to

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:40,239
see in terms of car video ever the Chris

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,239

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,680
his license this video is clearly going

00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,879
to be him driving around no we are

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,239

Lubin oil and we are wrestling naked

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,879
finally we've been dying to do this for

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,719
like 3 years okay all right our whole

26
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,000
career we've had lore of Matt being like

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,960
the the driver the driver triplet he's

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Matt has had his license for almost 5

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,960
years and he's looked so good our whole

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,439
career Matt's been driving us around

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,600
sacrificing his ankle sacrificing guys

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,640
the ankle bit is like not a joke Ser

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,799
like he's going to get an MRI like

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
severe ankle paint Matt has done so much

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,759
for the triplets and he's been just the

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,680
lead driver for the past five

37
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,600
years but yeah so basically I got my

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,880
permit while Nick was in Japan so we

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,840
were supposed to do it together and then

40
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,799
I go to Japan in Australia and I come

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
back didn't even send me a text the

42
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,000
courtesy text of like hey I'm doing this

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,520
thing we both needed to do for the past

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,719
two years I come back and he has Driving

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,880
School scheduled for the next 3 days cuz

46
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,799
he's that

47
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
guy so I'm I'm I literally and

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,560
figuratively am being left in the dust

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,799
like I'm being so wait so what's your

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,640
excuse I'm choking on Dust right now

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,560
what's your excuse I had I had three

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
driving lessons I did them all and then

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,360
I actually got my permit first try too

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
which is pretty awesome I failed the

55
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,360
permit test all right so guys what I'm

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,800
thinking is should I drink first

57
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,080
probably get you black just that I get

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,760
loose I saw this amazing statistic of if

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,280
you drink once and then you drunk you

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,319
drunk Drive you're not going to feel

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,040
really confident in it but if you drink

62
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,640
and drive consistently by the 20 of time

63
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,720
you're going to get out there hammered

64
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,040
feeling like I got this is a horrible

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,680
yeah I can get on the road drunk and

66
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,319
I'll be fine driving yeah obviously a

67
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,640
joke guys come on please don't drink and

68
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,400

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,000
is medical devices like needing like a

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,760
surgery needing a a transplant needing a

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,199
blood donation like anything medical

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
uh-uh kill me I'd rather I I agree with

that I don't like I don't like heights

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,919

being alone I don't like spiders okay I

119
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,160
don't like what if there was a spider

120
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,000
while you were by yourself it was

121
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,520
crawling on you I'm good was like I'm

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
going to touch you Chris I don't being

123
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
alone is number one for me my biggest

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,600
fear is Chris driving I don't like v i

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,440
don't look at the road stop don't even

126
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,840
joke when Chris first started driving

127
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,039
the craziest thing for me was sitting

128
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,919
behind Matt always I always for some

129
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,520
reason choose this left seat even though

130
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,479
the right one is available to me sorry I

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,520
didn't that and for the first time in my

132
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,039
life it was genuinely difficult to tell

133
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,440
who was who apart because I was so used

134
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,960
to Matt being in front of me and then

135
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,600
Chris had to stop and you could tell who

136
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,759
is who no Chris was just driving I'm

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,320
like okay this turn was rough imagine

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,199
this imagine you're a rookie in the NBA

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,000
season right yag and then you and then

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,000
you go face one one one to one against

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
LeBron James he's going to dunk on your

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,600
[ __ ] ass and he's going to make you

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,080
feel like a fo you're still in the NBA

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,680
okay imagine being a rook and not and

145
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,400
not talking you are you are the best I

146
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680

147
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,759
like I yell you because I know what you

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,680

license and you guys didn't for 5 years

244
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,760

was slap a bow on it like that was

249
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,040
perfect um anyway I had crippling

250
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,920
anxiety for okay for um all of middle

251
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,720
and high school so when Nick and Chris

252
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,279
would hang out with their friends I

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,040
would go to driving so annoying it was

254
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,120
like Matt get over it right correct

255
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,680
correct it's like stop faking that stop

256
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,839
faking your anxiety

257
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,360
youer but no but no I just really wanted

258
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
my license because I wanted to be able

259
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,480
to leave places I wanted to be able to

260
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,880
drive myself to school I wanted the the

261
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,320
power of being able to leave situations

262
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,680
and have a car and be able to drive all

263
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,959
I wanted so they would hang out with

264
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,959
friends and I would go to driving school

265
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,839
and I got my license and that means that

266
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,760
I would drive I wanted the power of

267
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
driving so bad so they didn't get their

268
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,320
license because I was going to drive us

269
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,959
all everywhere anyway and me man and

270
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,680
Chris have literally done everything

271
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,560
together ever since until this year

272
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,959
we're finally like being a little bit

273
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,200
more individual so it's time that we can

274
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,320
maybe transport ourselves places by

275
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,680
ourselves I started to get more anxiety

276
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,920
not to put blame on

277
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,560
anyone but who no you can't do that you

278
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,120
can't do that I'm not I'm not um just

279
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,000
like the idea of like if I broke my leg

280
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,760
in our house tomorrow or if I got shot

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,560
in the foot who knows what's going to

282
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,959
happen I would like there to be a

283
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,800
possibility of Transport that's not an

284
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,560

364
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,040
doing tricks on a chicken I have a story

365
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,040
time I already told Chris or he already

366
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,440
heard part of it but Nick you didn't so

367
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm going to say it and your reaction is

368
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,279
going to be better yeah this is funny me

369
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,399
Nick and Chris were shopping the other

370
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,680
day and I first of all I hate shopping

371
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,560
in general because that means I have to

372
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,880
leave my house second of all I hate a

373
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,320
lot I hate shopping during the holiday

374
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,440
season because it's way way more busy

375
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,399
and they make shopping such a fun it's

376
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,079
way more busy though and I don't like it

377
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,720
you can slow down for sure there you go

378
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,320
um so anyway never been told to slow

379
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,839
down when I'm literally at zero miles

380
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,160
per hour but well you can stop moving

381
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,199
forward is what I mean I wasn't

382
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,560
increasing speed I was at zero miles

383
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,880
hour you know what that means Z M

384
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,240
holiday season shopping is the worst and

385
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,160
here's my couple of examples why all the

386
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,759
railings that I have to put my hands on

387
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,120
now have [ __ ] tinsel and glitter all

388
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,440
of the that's like so n all of the music

389
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,560
that's being playing is taken from the

390
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,880
number one pop songs in the world to now

391
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,639
we're just blaring Christmas music and

392
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,839
everyone pretends to enjoy it and

393
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,639
pretends to be all happy like oh I just

394
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,199

395
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,279
