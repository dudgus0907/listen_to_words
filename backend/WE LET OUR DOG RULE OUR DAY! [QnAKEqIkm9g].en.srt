fifth grade mhm he's been a lovely pup

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,080
ever since yep how old is he like nine I

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,280
think he's about 9 eight or nine right

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,840
now and he's half Pug half beagle yep

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,239
and he's chubby and lazy yeah and today

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,559
for today's Wednesday video we're going

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,559
to dedicate today to Mr Trevor right

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,800
Trevor I know Trevor's dream day would

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,719
consist of doing nothing and laying down

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,280
but we're going to make you be a little

19
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,239
active today you're going to run around

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,359
maybe get some some cheese some treats

21
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,719
go on

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,399
walks he shows no excitement for

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,519
anything so yeah basically today we're

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,559
just going to do all the things that we

25
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,519
know Trevor loves that we want to take

26
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,360
and enjoy and do with him because when

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,680
we're in California we don't get to see

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,200
him that often anymore so it's a it's a

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,479
brotherly Bond today all right a fun

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,600
fact about Mr Trevor here is he hates

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,600
being in a car while someone else is

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
outside of the car we never have ever I

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,960
think in Trevor's entire existence left

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,479
him in the car completely alone but yet

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,840
he still

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,280
panics if just one person steps out of

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840
the car so we're headed to the pet store

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,280
right now to get Trevor some things that

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,360
he will want but right when we get there

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,680
and park the car we're going to all

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,640
instantly get out of the car as soon as

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,719
possible including Trevor so that way

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,040
there's no Panic ensuing and we won't

44
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,000
pick up food today without getting

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,000
Trevor outside the car cuz he hates

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,640
being in here so you'll get to come with

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
us everywhere we go M to

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,360
drive we're at a green light and he's

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,479
not moving I I imagine we're having like

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,680
a deep Stern voice I agree or just like

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,800
a little accent like a like a British

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,599
accent or a lisp what's up guys it's

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,440
okay it's okay it's okay see this is

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,040
