1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,480
instead of filming interviews this year

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,240
like we did for the last two we wanted

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,600
to post this video reflecting on the

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,800
past few years instead the last couple

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,639
of years of our life have been

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
absolutely crazy and very hard to

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,960
believe let's take it back to the very

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
beginning quickly at a young age we were

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,359
always passionate about videos getting

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,199
to look back at them and seeing the time

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,160
we were at the pool last summer or the

12
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,680
time I was shoveling 6 Ines of snow a

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,920
couple Winters ago the point is videos

14
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,439
hold memories and without videos you

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,840
could lose some of those memories or

16
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,480
they could start to fade from a young

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,000
age we all knew that we wanted to film

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,360
everything school started to get a

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,079
little harder and we started going to

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,600
friends houses or spending a lot of time

21
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,920
playing video games and couldn't find

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,039
the time to pick up a camera and then we

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,600
hit an alltime low our house catches on

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,760
fire and we lost almost everything we

25
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,079
had we move into an apartment across the

26
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,440
city navigating a new way of life with a

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,719
family of six in a small apartment the

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,920
start of covid-19 and being stuck at

29
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,680
home it felt like All Odds were against

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,320
us but we didn't know that after hitting

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,760
an alltime low it would bring back that

32
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,519
love for filment fing again and going

33
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,439
out and making memories overall that's

34
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,880
what we love to do together whether it

35
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,759
was sad memories happy memories or angry

36
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,880
memories they are memories and we get to

37
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,479
share them together and then we started

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,040
putting our videos on the internet and

39
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,759
you guys got to join the memories with

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
us from us just starting in our mom's

41
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,880
old minivan three kids just having funny

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
conversation to escape the reality of

43
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,119
school work and stress nothing else

44
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,759
matters when we get to laugh in that car

45
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,119
together all of reality just Fades away

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,400
then our dreams came true filming videos

47
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,200
together went from being a hobby to get

48
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,399
us out of the house to something special

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,040
to bond with you all we get to live

50
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,439
together in California we started to

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,960
complete our goals one by one last year

52
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,720
in 2023 we have gone on two tours across

53
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,880
the United States and we have climbed

54
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,200
our way to 5.7 million subscribers we

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,719
started a podcast and we have

56
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,759
accomplished personal goals that we have

57
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,320
never imagined like starting a clothing

58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,159
brand and meeting people that we looked

59
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,240
up to as an inspiration when we started

60
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,759
creating content and now we enter 2024

61
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,520
and we start to think what's next next

62
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,680
we're so happy and so grateful for where

63
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,799
we are but we constantly think do we

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,840
keep doing car videos is the podcast

65
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,399
really interesting if we stop we could

66
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,640
have more time to visit our family and

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,720
friends back home do we want to go on

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,200
tours again and if we do what should we

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,840
do on stage you start to overthink and

70
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,120
doubt yourself a little bit and to be

71
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,160
honest we don't know what the future

72
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,599
holds for our content or our life all we

73
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,400
know is that no matter what we end up

74
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,920
doing this year we will be happy

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,120
creating memories that we will be able

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,400
to look back at one day and say we are

77
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,360
proud of ourselves for so let's not put

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,239
a label on it it's never worth stressing

79
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,239
about let's just keep living our lives

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,560
and keep creating memories for you and

81
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,040
for us our goal with this video is to

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,040
tell you guys how we are feeling and

83
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,440
tell you where our head is at we feel

84
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,959
like we want to change our content up a

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,920
little bit but we want to tell you guys

86
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,680
our ideas so you can tell us how you're

87
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,280
feeling because we are nothing on the

88
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,360
internet if not for the people that

89
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,720
watch and care about us and we are so

90
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,280
grateful for all of you basically as of

91
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,599
right now we feel like we post videos

92
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,560
that are quantity over quality and

93
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,599
posting three videos a week including

94
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,840
podcasts makes it hard for us to get the

95
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,120
videos as good as we want them to be

96
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,040
lately we have been feeling like we want

97
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,760
to cut out Wednesday videos but keep

98
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,440
Friday videos and podcasts if we cut out

99
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,799
Wednesday videos we will make the Friday

100
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,840
videos higher quality and a mix between

101
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,319
classic car videos Vlogs and challenges

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,799
and our content will be longer before we

103
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,519
Implement any change in our posting

104
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,080
schedule we will let you guys know but

105
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,319

106
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,799
super happy and excited for the future

107
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,319

shoot we did for a new profile photo

110
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,439

111
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,000
like we're entering a new chapter in our

112
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,599
