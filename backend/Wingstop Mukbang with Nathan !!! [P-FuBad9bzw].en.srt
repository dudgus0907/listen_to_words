flats you're gonna love it it's like a

65
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,900
little game no that's the problem it's

66
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,180
too much of a game we're trying to get

67
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,500
right at it

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,239
we're starting with what we know

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,860
everything Popeyes was in a restaurant

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
and it was like a place it's not a

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,480
restaurant it's like both no fast food

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,580
yeah where is Popeyes though oh

73
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,440
definitely not a place it's Louisiana in

74
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,340
a fast yeah but does Louisiana have a

75
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,340
place called Popeyes

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,739
am I wrong

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,040
cause I feel like it's like is there

78
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,040
another plane going by yeah

79
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,560
this is just simply the altitude that

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,860
does to your ears

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,099
anyways what color do you hate most and

82
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,099
why

83
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,519
I love all colors that's a beautiful

84
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,599
name

85
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,919
no I really

86
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,979
but if I have to choose the least

87
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,199
favorite to probably be red all right I

88
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,780
still like red but I hate red it's not a

89
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,440
big fan of it I would say bright yellow

90
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,240
when I'm not sure right yellow but I'm

91
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,800
not in the mood it's very specific yeah

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,419
I agree like I can look at bright yellow

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,500
and be like okay but like if I'm like

94
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,940
pissed off and you just show me

95
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,259
something bright yellow I'm gonna be a

96
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,660
little bit more Angry trying to think

97
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,259
it's 100 and someone puts you in like a

98
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,259
corn maze

99
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,860
I feel like corn mazes are more green

100
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,199
though because they're not developing

101
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,960
horns well they have like yellow

102
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
everywhere I don't know I mean for a

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,979
good part there's corn and sunflowers

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,300
it's green they're like this in the

105
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,940
corner I don't even know what you mean

106
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,919
it's more green in nature whatever I'm

107
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,600
doing like neon highlighter yellow I

108
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,940
like the white one you add on

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,560
that's not highlighter yellow it is but

110
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,040
it's a font it's not a whole style yeah

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,040

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:39,300
okay why are you Incubus now look

130
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,979
the perfect dry rub Wing dude it does

131
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,539
look really good we used to be friends

132
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,160
with this girl that used to like there

133
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,620
was a lot of grease on pizza so she'd

134
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,940
like get a paper towel and like

135
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,020
dab the pizza

136
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,520
and Matt used to make fun of her and

137
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,259
then I just no I used to make fun of her

138
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,620
because she would have to put rubber

139
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,759
gloves on to eat food or to eat no

140
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,259
remember that one girl we used to be

141
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,699
friends with and she used to scrape the

142
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,699
cheese off Pizza yeah

143
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:13,259
sorry that's not so bad but because like

144
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,300
I don't know she had she didn't like the

145
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,979
feeling of Cheeto dust so she had to

146
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,940
like put a hospital gloves on to each

147
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,020
you know that's I just thought it was

148
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,880
weird stop making fun of people

149
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,520
come on I just feel like it's like

150
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,440
what's the big idea yeah see my thought

151
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,240
is if I had to put hospital grade gloves

152
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,639
to eat Cheetos I would just not eat

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,740
Cheetos in a crowd

154
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,900
like making a scene yeah to have enough

155
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,419
confidence to wear medical grade gloves

156
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,900
for chip eating she's gonna check me for

157
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,900
a cavity

158
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,500

Nathan I I honestly say this I think

186
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,580
every single time and for me it's Chris

187
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,620
is a [ __ ] pincher

188
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,540
like I'd rather be sucker punched across

189
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,279
the face than be pinched and Chris like

190
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,640
when he gets angry he pinches like a

191
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,740
little crab I hate I hate when

192
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,300
these [ __ ] are in bad moods

193
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,560
yeah that's a good one yeah

194
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,360
when Chris did a bad mood he makes it I

195
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,279
think everyone's problem no I don't bro

196
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,040
y'all raise the pants for if you agree

197
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,880
with me

198
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,860
that's crazy

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,760
it's true I didn't want to say it that's

200
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,420
crazy it's true

201
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,420
than bad problems

202
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,920
I feel like Spider-Man that was crazy

203
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,800
what were you saying I feel like Nick

204
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
has more frequent like

205
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,279
Outburst than I do I feel like 100

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,920
Outburst is like the perfect word Nick

207
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,000
has like episodes like okay did I just

208
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,880
get wet

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,399
do them okay I love this question what

210
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,540
what's the craziest thing you do for a

211
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,680
million dollars anything

212
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,440
that's not true

213
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,200
um there's not a lot I wouldn't do yeah

214
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,060
I agree you know but like

215
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,940
and of course there's some things I'd be

216
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,580
like would you streak at a sports game

217
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,240
yes yes fully naked though naked ass

218
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,160
naked yes like all you have is a sock in

219
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,700
your dick and you're running you could

220
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,700
take this off

221
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,240
monkeys you gotta get tackled naked

222
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,800
if you have to streak at any sporting

223
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,060
event which one would you pick the Super

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,060
Bowl go big or go home

225
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,620
what are you gonna do you gotta do it at

226
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:59,459
like something dude what's the what's

227
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,220
the if I were to Street the Oakland A's

228
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,779
yeah is that them they they're like

229
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,579
they're probably gonna get rid of that

230
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,880
oh yeah because they're they have zero

231
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,880
fans oh

232
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,740
like that like they don't sell any

233
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,240
tickets

234
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,640
it's honestly like because I was just

235
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,140
thinking if you streak that your nudes

236
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,880
probably wouldn't even get leaked like

237
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,120
it's crazy no we should

238
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,920
I think we should all uh I actually

239
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,720
really used to like the A's because of

240
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,240
their colors we should just export all

241
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,500
our fan base to them absolutely we

242
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,660

249
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,120

this is like the the MLB yeah they're

255
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,300

God how is an MLB team doing so bad I

257
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,660

261
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,220

just kicking his feet yeah I mean if

268
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,600
we're talking about what's crazy that

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
monkeys can just like wear clothes I

270
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,639
feel like it's like I feel like it's a

271
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,440
necessity to see the money it's a

272
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,480
necessity to see the monkeys if you go

273
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,980
to the zoo

274
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
actually like swing on Vines and [ __ ] is

275
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,220
that like a real thing I know of course

276
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,060
I've never seen that happen name the

277
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,060
plane

278
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,060
no

279
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,260
what about bamboo who thinks they should

280
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,260
have let harambe just take down the kid

281
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,519
I think it's crazy that they like like I

282
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,700
obviously I I can't understand how

283
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,740
that child got into harambe's habitat

284
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,720
almost like a jumped and then they

285
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,480
killed harambe

286
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,540
81. it's like if you walk into a bear

287
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,519
trap and it chops your leg off

288
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,839
if I ran into Nate's house and he called

289
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,940
the police why would they come in and

290
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,060
kill Nate correct

291
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,540
I'm not saying that very good point

292
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,160
well I don't know next time

293
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,760

[Music]

309
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,920
I feel like we should buy that app that

310
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,500
you can track the planes and then you

311
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,519

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,040
was like a magic trick you should have

315
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,260
pretended to like take it out of my ear

316
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,959

no before we get into the new Wings

319
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,199
let's answer one more question it says

320
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,199
what is a super unnecessary item and why

321
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,699
I feel like we don't need a comb if we

322
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,820
have a brush

323
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:17,100
oh we're talking like this anything

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,720
yeah I don't even like if you were

325
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,120
outside like

326
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,560
fighting for our life I don't know just

327
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,000
like survival no unnecessary item

328
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,680
I feel like they could have done

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,600
something with the brooms and the rakes

330
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,339
where it's like you could just nope

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,500
totally different okay I feel like there

332
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,420
can be a way better alternate bubble

333
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,459
wrap like every time I use my bubble

334
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,459
wrap it just like my ship breaks anyway

335
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,860

336
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,380
