00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,420
we don't know what we're in for at all

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm going to show you a couple things

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,599
that we're packing for our personal

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,579
hygiene that I know guaranteed I'm gonna

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,020
have to use on there all right before we

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,579
go I wanna let you guys know the number

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,440
one thing across the board for personal

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,180
hygiene for me Matt and Chris is making

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,680
sure that we're wearing deodorant so we

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,899
all use native deodorant this is mine

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,180
vanilla and Sandalwood vanilla and

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,100
Sandalwood has a warm and cozy scent to

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,379
it and then this is Chris's which is

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,180
coconut and vanilla coconut vanilla

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,280
smells beachy and sweet

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,199
and then we have Matt's charcoal

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
deodorant the charcoal smells just like

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,520
charcoal but with a little bit of citrus

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,020
and then also here you go thanks they

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,300
sent us from their new Candy Shop

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,519
collection sour Berry belts which smells

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,100
exactly like the candy on this all of

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,720
these are paraben and aluminum free and

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,400
unlike other deodorants I've used in the

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,560
past when applying them I feel sticky

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,180
but with these they apply dry and then I

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,100
feel dry the entire time afterwards

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,600
while wearing it I also have the comfort

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,759
of knowing that I'm never gonna smell

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,920
bad because native deodorant has a 72

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,479
hour odor protection and it's vegan and

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,600
cruelty free

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,460
which is awesome oh yes and yeah guys

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,840

333
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,279
