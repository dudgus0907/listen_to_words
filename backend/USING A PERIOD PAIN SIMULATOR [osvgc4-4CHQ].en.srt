period simulator and Nick and Chris said

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,360
that they refused to do it on live and

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,239
obious I do genuinely still refuse to do

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
this so we're going to see how this goes

63
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,840
cuz it's like yeah we're pulling it out

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,680
but we're not necessarily guaranteed

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,239
that we're doing it I don't know if I'm

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,560
doing

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,800
that that's a crazy crazy crazy out of

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,159
context yeah we're pulling it out but I

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,120
can't guarantee that we're doing that

70
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,799
that was a crazy caution what does that

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,400
say nothing read it nothing important

72
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,239
