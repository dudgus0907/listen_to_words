00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,520
right that is that is the definition of

131
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,919
too young I haven't even had a thought

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,120

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,879
okay weird like a space heater it's

183
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,599
giving like we lived in a cave no no no

184
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,360
just like a space heater maybe ancient

185
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,000
Egyptian hieroglyphics

kid scissors like the oh safety kids

189
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
kids friendly scissors fun scissors yeah

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,319
if you could go back in time and change

191
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,800
one thing what would it be probably my

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
to get all the king horses and All the

193
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,720
King's Men to get back Humpty Dumpty

194
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,800
back together again think about it if I

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
go back it's crazy they got all the

196
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,840
king's horses and All the King's Men for

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,560
for an egg that was sitting on a Ledge

198
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Humpty Dumpty think about your decisions

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,199
right go back to Prime fortnite is that

200
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,840
what the question holy [ __ ] is that the

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,039
question moving on holy [ __ ] we're done

202
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,960
what would you do if you could transform

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,000
into any animal going be an arachnet so

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,599
I could scare Chris in his sleep like a

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,960
little spider I'd kill you no you

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,639
wouldn't [ __ ] you'd run away no I

207
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,680
wouldn't I'd call Matt and say hey kill

208
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,080
this thing exactly what said um I'd

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,240
probably be a little mouse and crawl up

210
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,319
Nick's leg I was thinking a mouse and

211
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,840
then I eat your cheese [ __ ] that would

212
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,720
probably cross the line if I ate your

213
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,759
cheese yeah get out of my get out of my

214
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,960
house you cheese eater okay dude I think

215
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,520
I just want to be our M our mice really

216
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,720
eating cheese like this I don't think so

217
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,520
where the [ __ ] are they getting

218
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,280
cheese what every single time we're

219
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,159
using a cheese for a mouse or not we but

220
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,280
the we as in the people yeah we are

221
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:28,120
killing the mouse or trapping the mouse

222
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,199
mouse trapping where do they get cheese

223
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,919
otherwise is it like a cheesy thing like

224
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,120
do they get cheese all the time they

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,320
might but how is that the food I I don't

226
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,399
know I don't know who declared cheese my

227
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,440
food I feel like they're more of like a

228
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,000
crumb like anything those [ __ ]

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,160
e anything they're rodents I feel like I

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,200
transform into I keep seeing something

231
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,320
like go by like I keep seeing something

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,519
in my peripheral and looking up and

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,880
there's nothing the engine heated

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,440

you're like climbing up the top ropes I

255
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,240
tag you in and jump on the alterate te

256
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
version of me from that

257
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,440
movie he'd be

258
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,920
scary he'd be a scary scary person like

259
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,720

I don't I don't think he would at all I

262
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,320
think he'd be like kind of like like me

263
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,320
on a bad day plus like a dark energy M

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,320
okay God you know what I mean though

265
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,560
terrifying right next Nick with like a

266
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,360
really straight face just would freak me

267
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,760
out just yell at people like that do you

268
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,920
remember when the dad in the movie was

269
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,399
doing that next they just be doing stuff

270
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,959
and he'd be

271
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,920
like just yell at them okay that

272
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,360
literally sounded like the um the

273
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,360
Scooby-Doo cartoon Frankenstein guy when

274
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,680
he like falls down the slide you know

275
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,959

298
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,880
the classic diary that opens up to a

299
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,519

shut oh my God that's

303
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,000
terrible if you three never have to

304
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,680
worry about again what would they be

305
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,920
nothing I want to constantly be worried

306
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,360
cuz that's the only way that you make

307
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,160
progress yep you have to be

308
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,120
uncomfortable to be comfortable up top

309
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,279
give me five brother man what's the

310
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,240
first thing you would do if they

311
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:04,320
announced a Purge in the USA wrong those

312
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,279
who wronged me no no I'm just kidding I

313
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,079
wouldn't seek revenge I do something

314
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,120
super simple but like slightly illegal

315
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,800
run a red light like take a tip jar from

316
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,120
a restaurant that's just mean Nick come

317
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,079
on well no notz I don't want them to

318
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,959
have their tips but like the excitement

319
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,279
of like the tip bottle jar whatever is

320
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,839
right on the counter I just want to grab

321
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,480
it and leave yeah I'd probably something

322
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,760
bare minimum like that nothing too crazy

323
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,600
I'd probably boor up my house so no one

324
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,040
can come in that's see you're taking a

325
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,480
defensive approach everyone's always

326
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,160
like this and then I run outside and

327
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,639
punch the first person I see is hard as

328
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,320
I can what would you do if you could

329
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,040
only have oh my God that just made me

330
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
think like if there was a purge one

331
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,839
thing that I feel like a fun activity

332
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,480
that would be really comical is like

333
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
sitting on the roof with like a ton of

334
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,959
tangerines and as people like walk by

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,880
just throw like a like a Halo or like a

336
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,480
cutie like one of like something that

337
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,600
size where it's not going to hurt you

338
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,079
know what I mean it would hurt no

339
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,240
no it would if someone hummed a CU

340
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,040
[ __ ]

341
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,560
roof it would hurt it would hurt no you

342
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,240
are [ __ ] I think that' be so funny I

343
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,480
I would want to be able to

344
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,440
teleport here and I am now I'm gone I

345
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,000
would also wish to be a that's like so

346
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,720
clutch just to be able to like oh I want

347
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
to go to a

348
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,199
meeting there dab into the teleportation

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
is that how you guys I feel like I do it

350
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,199
like this twist I feel like you wouldn't

351
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,839
have to do anything I feel like you just

352
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,560
like think hard enough

353
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,720
I feel like you have to do it through a

354
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,519
doorway hello

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,519
[ __ ] here like you just come out

356
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
of nowhere okay that's how I think it

357
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,839
would be hello [ __ ] I'm here

358
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,000
yeah that's exactly what I think it

359
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,720
would be I think of it as more of like a

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,680
like you go to a door and you just pray

361
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,160
to end up on the other side that's how I

362
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,160
introduce myself all the time no you

363
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,519

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,600
three triplet you don't say that one of

three triplets not one of three trip ret

366
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,199

move I like oh they got the gist I

372
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,759

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,360
one of you guys I feel like I wouldn't

400
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,519
know right away until I like look in the

401
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839

you have answer to this question that

412
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,440
makes sense I'm just a little confused I

413
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,720
don't think I'd feel this way at all I

414
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,680
kind of agree I think I'd be shocked

415
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,800

416
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,079

417
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,880
just like instinctively was like that

418
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,399
was me being like stop making this noise

419
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,680
like I tried to put my hand up or

420
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
something all right so what would you do

421
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,040
with if you were me a propeller hat I

422
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,399
like that nickname come on PA put it on

423
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:08,360

424
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:10,600

427
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,040
destiny what would you do if you realize

428
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,240
your whole YouTube Carew was a dream and

429
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,680
you woke up um better go back to bed oh

430
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,600
that's a good answer go back to sleep

431
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,519
mhm um I would probably well you could

432
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,199
say we're living the

433
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,040
dream good joke good joke good joke good

434
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,560
joke it depends if if I woke up and our

435
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,399
YouTube Carew was just a dream I'd wake

436
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,319
up as like past Nick a sophomore in high

437
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,839
school no

438
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,720
senior oh no cuz that's when it started

439
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:49,040
we would be like sophomores like Juniors

440
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,040
yeah oh my God yeah what would you do

441
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,880
well I would just take all that

442
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,040
knowledge and be like that's what I

443
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,759
could be I just need to work hard and I

444
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,240
would use it as motivation every single

445
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,920
day I wouldn't inside and out you every

446
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,360
single time I wake up from a dream I

447
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,920
immediately my first thought is like

448
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,520
that's never possible for me no what

449
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,880
what would you do if your Shadow came to

450
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,670
life like okay Peter Pan literally [ __ ]

451
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,360
skip around try and find it pin it to my

452
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:16,640
[Laughter]

453
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,679
feet I think the funniest thing about

454
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,199
Peter Pan is his Shadows missing and

455
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,839
he's trying to pin that [ __ ] CH

456
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,799
he's trying to pin it down what would

457
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,199
you do if a genie didn't give you three

458
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,799
wishes I'd probably shake it out of him

459
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,360
where are the wishes give me my wishes

460
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,440
if you kill the

461
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,160
groove yeah yeah what would you do if

462
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,320
you got the urge to break dance and you

463
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,960
just couldn't sit still break probably

464
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
break dance and it just wouldn't go away

465
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
I probably have to break dance what

466
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,720
would you do if you were granted the

467
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,640
power to heal others but only by using

468
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
your feet heal others with my feet and

469
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,919
they just have to get over it that it's

470
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
with my feet how would I do it like if

471
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,280
you want to get healed yeah that's right

472
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,720
like direct contact or is it a ray no I

473
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,559
feel like it's like a rub like you just

474
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,480
had to like rub your foot on them oh I

475
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:03,960
was taking full medic IAL procedures but

476
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,440
feet SCA like this you're insane that's

477
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,960
the craziest thought that's literally

478
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,600
what I was thinking the power to heal

479
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,080
people I don't consider that a power I

480
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,559
consider that I what don't deny the

481
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,919
don't say that I think doctors and

482
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,960
