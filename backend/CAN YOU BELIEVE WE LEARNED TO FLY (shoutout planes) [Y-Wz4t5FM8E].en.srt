95
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,560
she was trying to get a hold of him

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,760

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,760

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,239
and there was people everywhere and I

99
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,840

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,599
and he stands on it and I literally

105
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,720

tying your own hockey [ __ ] you kid come

393
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,880
on on all right what to talk about if

394
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,480
you had any superpower but it only

395
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,279
activated when you sneezed what would

396
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,920
you want it to be I just want to admit

397
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,440

398
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,480
everyone around me full circle circular

399
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,760
just a full big flame around me that'd

400
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
be kind of hard if but if you were

401
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
sneezing you'd have to like run away

402
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,880
from people in public or you go to jail

403
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,240
if you assaulted them no I'd want to

404
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,160
sneeze $10,000 into my hand that's a

405
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,839

sniffing pepper every night no i' just

407
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,639
be waving a [ __ ] feather on my nose

408
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,120
that's so like the

409
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:07,320
feather traction control

410
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,720
disabled it's okay buddy you can shut

411
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,000
that off if I'm sneezing and it's like

412
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,240
my superpower I would say it just brings

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,759
me to whatever like location is in my

414
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,199

416
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,880

it's like to be chew I definitely if if

423
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,959
I had the superpower I'd find a way that

424
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,120
like I'd carry in my pocket like a

425
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,480
sneeze activator and it would be like

426
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,880
something that I could just like wave or

427
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,759
like eat that would like force me to

428
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,880
sneeze if I could time travel I wouldn't

429
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,279
even do it why cuz I feel like if you

430
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,240

431
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,519

Mr [ __ ] Pepsi Drinker 10 a day Red

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,800
Baron pizza is the only thing you eat

436
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Hershey bar oh get me a Hershey bar if

437
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,880

438
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,720
a Hershey bar right now no but what I'm

439
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,839
saying is like I feel like no not time

440
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,600
travel but

441
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,759
teleportation I feel like that just

442
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,440
can't be good for you like if all your

443
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,199
body ends up somewhere else like it's

444
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,880
like oh the like cuz I think of like

445
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,079
going in a plane like when you go in a

446
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,600
plane it's like the altitude control can

447
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,240
we believe we figured that out no I

448
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,240
can't are we [ __ ] serious sometimes I

449
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,720
think cuz me and my CR fly all the time

450
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,480
cuz we live in two different places and

451
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,399
I'm on the plane and I'm like shout the

452
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,920
[ __ ] out whoever came up with I can't

453
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,839
believe I don't have to walk to

454
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,360
California I can't [ __ ] believe it

455
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,759
and why are the [ __ ] who

456
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,600
invented the plane not the first thing

457
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,519
you see going into the airport I agree I

458
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,440
need a statue of those twins I think the

459
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,120
right Brothers the right Brothers I need

460
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,199
them statue in every airport every

461
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,240
single time I'm headed to terminal ABC

462
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:05,120
car I think their car regardless yeah

463
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,480
they need much recognition you're a

464
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
[ __ ] idiot are you talking crazy

465
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,079
because they definitely came up with

466
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,079
boats first and that's why everything

467
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,759
was like land or sea and then someone

468
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,120
was like one if by land two if by Sea

469
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,360
that was hard what history lesson PA R

470
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,600
Paul R I don't [ __ ] with Paul R at all

472
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,880
funniest thing ever and can we say this

473
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,560
on the internet you think or no yeah I

474
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,800
think at this point we it is so funny

475
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,079
there was one video and I don't know if

476
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,160
you guys were able to figure out when it

477
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,079
is cuz I feel like we talked talked

478
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,000
about part of it but then we cut some of

479
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,319
it out but we literally cut out Chris

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,920
calling Paul River [ __ ] cuz we were

481
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,560
afraid that we were going to like get

482
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,759
fully canceled off the internet you want

483
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,560
know what I'm thinking in my head right

484
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,240
now that's not real what I'm thinking of

485
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,199
like a squirrel or a chipmunk or like a

486
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
bunny rabbit getting in a fight and

487
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,560
using a blueberry as like a big weapon

488
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,639

know I was just sitting here and I was

491
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,600
thinking like I was thinking of

492
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,240
something to say cuz we're obviously

493
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,360
filming a car video and I was like oh if

494
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,520
I was a little creature I would use a

495
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,880
blueberry as like a paintball and just

496
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,160
right up my friend get them gotcha and

497
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,439
then it's like a bunny with a bunch of

498
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,439
blue

499
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,400

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720

with us for the past two and a half

625
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,240
years we had I was thinking of this

626
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,520
today because or one of our fans that

627
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,919
has been supporting me Matt and Chris

628
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,520
for like over three years now and was

629
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,360
probably one of the first hundred people

630
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,159
to subscribe to us her name is Ellie she

631
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,799
has been subscribed to her YouTube

632
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,000
channel and engaged with what mimat and

633
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,240
Chris have done the actual entire time

634
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,240
that we've been posting on YouTube and

635
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
it made me think of how many people

636
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,039
there are that have devoted so much of

637
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,440
their life to being a fan of us and will

638
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,320
grow up with stories of growing up with

639
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,039
us being their favorite YouTubers and

640
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,480
it's the most mind-blowing thing ever so

641
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,720
I just wanted to say thank you to you

642
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,000

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,039
some level of M Matt and Chris have been

644
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,440
posting about two times a week for

645
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,000
literally those three years in a row so

646
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,679
sometimes we'll talk about things like

647
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,440
before the three of us like agree on it

648
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,240
or like work out something enough like

649
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,279
creatively so sometimes we'll like tell

650
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,520
you guys we're going to do something and

651
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,360
then we're not actually going to do it

652
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,720
or like we'll run ideas past you guys

653
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,720
and we like it could be in like super

654
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,960
early stages but with filming so much of

655
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,400
our Lives sometimes we bring stuff up a

656
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,400
little to preemptively of them happening

657
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,520
I remember when we were going to start

659
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,960
