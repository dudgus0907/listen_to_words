1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
So ultimately, fundamentally, I am a

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,799
hardware person. There's like screws

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,639
flowing through my blood or something in

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,160
there somewhere. My parents would

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,559
occasionally complain when I would take

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,080
stuff apart in the house, but usually I

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,400
was able to successfully put it back

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,680
together, so it ended up being okay. I

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,480
want to build the best laptop. I want to

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,640
build a laptop company. framework is a

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,960
company that builds longerlasting

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
consumer electronics products so that if

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
anything ever happens to the product,

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,119
something breaks or you just need more

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,800
out of it, more performance or more

16
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,120
capability, you can actually just open

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,160
it up very easily using the screwdriver

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,160
that we include in the

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,680
box, swap out a part and keep using it

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
for longer. growing more than double

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,440
revenue year-over-year for the last

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,200
couple of years, which is pretty unusual

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,320
for a consumer electronics startup,

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
especially in a pretty tough

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,840
environment. Fundamentally, the mission

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,079
is about empowering the enduser of the

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,920
product, making it clear that this is

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
their product, not our product. One of

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
the problems that I thought was most

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
important to solve was just how hard it

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,240
was for consumer electronics startups to

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
be successful. But looking across

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,159
consumer electronics across the entire

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
startup space, it was clear that there

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
were a number of companies that had

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,720
really interesting and really excellent

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
products but failed. Anyway, the thing I

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
needed to do is prove that there's a

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,840
better business model for consumer

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
electronics. One of the secrets to

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,159
building a successful startup is that

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
the CEO needs to

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,040
be in school and actually I graduated

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,840
from university in 2009. That was a

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
period of great economic uncertainty. it

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
was uh the start of a pretty heavy

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,840
recession and so actually there weren't

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,479
a lot of jobs available and there was

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
not a single hardware company hiring. Um

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,960
but it turned out that Apple in one of

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,520
their software organizations did have

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,439
this role open that I was able to jump

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,920
into right out of school. And so I ended

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,000
up at Apple for a little over 3 years

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,039
working on software of all things. Apple

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
had just released the iPhone 3GS. This

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,920
was like right still at the dawn of

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,360
smartphones becoming the default mode of

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
interaction and actually kind of the

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
default mode of computing. So I was

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,840
working on FaceTime and uh Game Kit and

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,239
Game Center which was this kind of

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,599
multiplayer games framework that Apple

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,160
was developing from a software

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,239
perspective. And mostly what that

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
experience taught me was that I didn't

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
really want to work in a company like

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,720
Apple. Um one of the challenges at Apple

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,400
is that it is a very very siloed

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
company. as an engineer there, it was

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,440
actually quite frustrating that I would

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
see all this cool hardware or see all

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,840
this cool software but have no real

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,760
ability to either influence or even

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,319
understand or speak to the people who

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,239
were building it. So I was working a

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,800
relatively normal number of hours a

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,959
week. So like say like 40 to 50 hours a

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
week, a normal number of hours. And I

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,400
would spend another 40 to 50 hours a

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,560
week actually tinkering on mostly VR

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,599
stuff. And this was before VR was like

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,239
actually really a thing. building these

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,599
little gadgets and tools and toys to

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
basically just see what was even

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,959
possible and doing it within a community

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
of other people who were like-minded.

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
And so one of the other people in that

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,599
community was probably the farthest

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
along in that community was someone

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,959
named Palmer Lucky who of course ended

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,319
up founding Oculus. My name is Palmer

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
Lucky and I'm a virtual reality

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,920
enthusiast and the designer of the Rift.

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,319
Where this all started was in my

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
parents' garage in Long Beach,

97
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,440
California. And I was interested in

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,280
stereoscopic displays. I was interested

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,959
in headmounts. And the problem was there

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
was nothing that gave me the experience

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,120
that I wanted, the Matrix, where I can

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
plug in and actually be in the game. And

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
I was sure that somewhere out there

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,480
there was something that I could buy.

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,080
And the reality is there's nothing. I

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,680
set out to change that with the Oculus

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
Rift.

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,879
And at the time that he founded Oculus

109
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,680
back in 2012, there was just one piece

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,080
of the headset that was missing, which

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,680
was motion tracking. And motion tracking

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,760
happened to be the one gadget that I was

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,319
personally the furthest along on. And I

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,799
had sent one of two prototypes of motion

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,160
track that I'd built to Palmer a few

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
months earlier just to get his thoughts

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,759
on it and see see if it would be useful

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
to him. And so in mid 2012, Palmer

119
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
reached out to me and asked if I wanted

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
a demo of this VR headset that he'd been

121
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
building up and said, "Of course, of

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,759
course I want a demo of it." And I ended

123
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
up meeting with him and the rest of the

124
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
early team, the rest of the founding

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
team there. And what I thought was going

126
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,919
to be a demo turned into a job offer.

127
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
And they said, "Uh, you have to leave

128
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,520
Apple and join us within a week cuz we

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
really need your motion tracker." And

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
that was just an very obvious choice for

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
me of like, yeah, I don't want to be at

132
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
Apple. I want to be working on this cool

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,639
stuff here. VR, let's do it. But

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
actually, the move from Apple to Oculus

135
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
was a bit more a bit more of a jump

136
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
because at that point, of course, Apple

137
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,240
was on its very rapid growth trajectory

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
and to leave that very rapidly growing

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,280
company and join this scrappy startup of

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,960
people trying to build VR on on its

141
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
surface seemed crazy. And I think my

142
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,639
parents at first were like, "Oh, are you

143
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,280
sure? This doesn't seem like a good

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,720
idea." Um, but I was convinced. I I knew

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,479
that that it was the right team of

146
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,400
people. I knew it was the right

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
technology space to explore at that time

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,639
and of course ended up being a good bet

149
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,639
to have

150
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,560
taken. This episode is sponsored by

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,479
The first two years of Oculus. So from

169
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,600
2012 until we got acquired in 2014,

170
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,360
literally every month was some new

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,880
insane occurrence and insane change,

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
insane learning. Like the pace of

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,720
iteration that we had across those two

174
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,160
years, I look back on and think like how

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,720
did we even do that? A normal hardware

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,639
product, a consumer hardware product, it

177
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,039
takes somewhere between 12 to 24 months

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
to go from initial idea of like, oh,

179
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,240
this is a product I think I want to

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,240
build to being able to do development

181
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,800
cycles on it, ramp up production, and

182
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,440
getting it into a customer's hands. the

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Oculus Rift dev kit, the first dev kit,

184
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,960
we went from the company forming to

185
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,080
getting it into customers hands I think

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,599
in six months, which is not not normal.

187
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,720
That's not how you build build hardware

188
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,759
normally. Working with devs to get all

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
this going. There's some really

190
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
incredible and interesting stories

191
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
around that. But that's not what this

192
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
talk is about. This talk is only about

193
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,720
the hardware side of the story. We

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,440
decided to take a different optimization

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,759
and optimize for getting the virtual

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,280
reality ecosystem seated as quickly as

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
possible for the sake of figuring out

198
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
what is VR, what works and what doesn't

199
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,360
work in VR. And for that we needed help

200
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,360
from all of you which required us to

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,319
take the risk and build a product really

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
really

203
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,280
quickly. And one of the challenging

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
things here, one of the the biggest like

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
mistakes maybe that we made is that

206
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,319
obviously we were a startup. We're on a

207
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
shoestring budget. We were being

208
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
incredibly efficient. We're going as

209
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,960
fast as we can because we knew we needed

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,199
to make progress before running out of

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,880
money basically. And as soon as we got

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,000
acquired by Facebook 2 years in, we had

213
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,280
effectively unlimited money and

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,960
unlimited resource and we could hire

215
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,360
literally as many people as we wanted

216
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
to. There were actually no limits aside

217
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,120
from how quickly we could physically

218
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
onboard people to how quickly we could

219
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
hire. It actually slowed us down. It

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,720
slowed us to a total halt. basically

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,280
went from iterating on a new version of

222
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
VR headsets essentially every few months

223
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,319
to not being able to ship another

224
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,039
product for about 3 years. And so we

225
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,199
lost the massive iteration velocity that

226
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
we had. And it meant that that

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,840
three-year bet instead of the six-month

228
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,919
bet had to be so perfectly right

229
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,000
otherwise the opportunity cost of

230
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,399
missing those three years would end up

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,839
destroying us. And we kind of got it a

232
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,159
little bit right, maybe not as right as

233
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,440
we needed to, but looking back on it

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,599
now, those early years in Facebook, what

235
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
we really needed to be focused on was

236
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,880
iteration speed, not trying to build a

237
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
big team and build a big consumer

238
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,600
polished product. And so that's what

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,760
brought me to then start up framework

240
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
and then build an even more incredible

241
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,640
team, but a very small focused team

242
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
where we have this clear mission, clear

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,800
vision, clear roadmap that we're able to

244
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,800
execute on.

245
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
One of the things that works really well

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,760
for us is that the market that we're

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,360
entering, the categories that we're

248
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,680
entering in each of our products,

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,640
they're just colossal. So for us, we

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,200
look at $200 billion notebook market and

251
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,360
we see massive, massive headroom to

252
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
continue to grow and succeed in this

253
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,680
business model that's focused on

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,680
longevity. It actually means that the

255
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
more we grow as a company, the more

256
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
market share we capture, we're actually

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
shrinking the size of the notebook

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,240
industry because we're going from a mode

259
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,080
where consumers and businesses are

260
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
defaulting to replacing a product, let's

261
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,160
say, every 3 to 5 years to a mode where

262
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
they're using the products for longer.

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
And so that's actually a win condition

264
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,040
for us that we're converting an industry

265
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,160
from one that is shorter lived to one

266
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,640
that's more efficient and longer lived.

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
And as a startup, of course, we have an

268
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,880
immense amount of headroom and a ceiling

269
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,760
that's very very far away that we can

270
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,600
continue to grow within. But even as we

271
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
capture more and more of that pie, that

272
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,600
doesn't mean that we would need to then

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
change our business model to go back

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,680
into that transactional model that other

275
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,600
companies are taking today. It means

276
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,920
that we've grown in an install base

277
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,040
that's large enough that this network

278
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,560
effects based re-engagementbased

279
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,480
business is a massive business in

280
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,480
itself. And of course, as a company,

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
we're not only limiting ourselves to

282
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
notebooks. It's that we're taking the

283
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,800
success that we've had with notebooks

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,800
and bringing that category by category

285
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,440
across this just huge consumer

286
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
electronics

287
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,880
industry. You're really thinking about

288
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,399
the audiences that you're going after.

289
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,279
We actually have this concept that we

290
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,279
call terminal audiences. this idea that

291
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,000
we enter a new product category and we

292
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,560
lock in an industrial design and a form

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,320
factor and set of features that we're

294
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,079
defining both the initial set of

295
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
audiences that we can win with most

296
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,120
efficiently but then also the terminal

297
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,959
audience basically the broadest furthest

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
away audience we think we could still

299
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
win with this product and we make sure

300
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,760
that we know what those bounds are when

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,160
we reach and build new products for

302
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,560
example a framework laptop 12 that gives

303
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,720
us a moment of reset of this is is a new

304
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
category. We're renting a new segment.

305
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,800
We have to figure out now who are our

306
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,640
initial audiences for this product which

307
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,200
actually start from the same core

308
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,279
audiences as our other products. But

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
then who are the terminal audiences? And

310
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,200
one thing we were deliberate on with

311
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,000
this new product is we made it simpler.

312
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,240
We made it much much lower cost and we

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
made it more generally appealing to

314
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,000
people who are not necessarily tech

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,399
enthusiasts. And so as we think about

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
this product, the core tech enthusiast

317
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,640
is still there as an initial audience,

318
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,760
but our terminal audience is a lot

319
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,760
bigger and a lot further

320
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:17,279
away. Audience expansion is definitely

321
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,079
the key to success in consumer startups

322
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,480
in general. We have a set of core

323
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,279
audiences that we kind of layer outwards

324
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,279
on top of one by one as we go. And of

325
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,440
course like it's easy to come up with

326
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,240
personas like define these discrete

327
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,800
personas of like DIYer and we have Linux

328
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
user and we have like IT manager and we

329
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
have environmentally conscious consumer.

330
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,920
We have these very clear personas. But

331
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,680
obviously in real life people are more

332
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,600
complex than that. Like everyone is some

333
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
combination of a million different

334
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,040
things. And so it's not that we

335
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,200
necessarily have this like clear set of

336
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,959
like layers where it's like a discrete

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,920
layer, discreet layer, discreet layer.

338
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,320
It's that we're slowly growing the reach

339
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,399
and awareness and credibility of what

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,839
we're doing as we go and then pulling in

341
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,680
those people whose personas match to the

342
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,160
things that we're delivering value or

343
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,040
interest around. So we took that tech

344
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,639
enthusiast gamer persona and the various

345
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
subpersonas within it and thought like,

346
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,760
okay, how do we win that audience? And

347
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,760
we thought they want latest and greatest

348
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
graphics. Like graphics upgradability is

349
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,440
huge for the audience and they just

350
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,320
can't get it out of a laptop. And so we

351
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,160
thought, okay, when we build our next

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,959
laptop form factor, the thing we should

353
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,120
prioritize is graphics upgradability so

354
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,639
we can go win that audience. And so this

355
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,800
goes back to fulfilling our mission. We

356
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,040
have this long lasting repairable

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
upgradeable product but doing it in a

358
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,839
way that also expands our audience reach

359
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,320
by being not just a new version of our

360
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
laptop in a different form factor but

361
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
enables this functionality that is

362
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,560
actually the key thing that was holding

363
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,040
back a specific set of consumers out

364
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,040
there in the world.

365
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,079
One of the biggest things that I've

366
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,680
learned actually and I've actually tried

367
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,760
to share with other people starting

368
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,320
consumer hardware startups is that

369
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,920
critical fundraising roadmap. And of

370
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,920
course, if you're building hardware,

371
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,600
there's typically a 2-year ramp from

372
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,399
coming up with the product you want to

373
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,079
build to being able to ship the first

374
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
version of it and collect revenue for

375
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,800
the first time. If you can't fund your

376
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,959
way to escape velocity, you're going to

377
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,880
fail anyway. So, what you need to do is

378
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,040
think through what is that path? What's

379
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,800
the high assurance path that you have as

380
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,480
a company with the product and business

381
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,720
model you're building and the audiences

382
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
that you're going after to reach escape

383
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,880
velocity? Meaning the point in time

384
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,959
where you're able to self-fund your own

385
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
product roadmap and your own growth. And

386
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,639
so one of the most important things for

387
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,120
consumer hardware especially because

388
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,000
those development timelines are so long

389
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,320
is to make sure that you have funding in

390
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,880
the loop almost this idea that you're

391
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
talking to investors very early and very

392
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,120
regularly to make sure that at the right

393
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,959
points in time when you're going to need

394
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,199
funding that you're going to be able to

395
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,120
show the right kinds of traction and the

396
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,880
right kinds of metrics for those

397
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,399
investors to see the signals that

398
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
they'll need to see to be able to put

399
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
funding into you. that even though we

400
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,399
have a product time horizon that's two

401
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,680
years away, we have a vision time

402
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,480
horizon that's 20 years away, that we we

403
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,959
look out 20 years and we see a world and

404
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,320
a consumer electronics industry that's

405
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,399
fundamentally different. That this

406
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
business model that we've adopted at

407
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
scale is just so fundamentally more

408
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,519
efficient than the traditional business

409
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,600
model and so much better as a model for

410
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,360
both us as a company and for the

411
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,120
customers buying the product that we

412
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,199
know it's a winning model. And so we see

413
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,519
that as this north star for us that we

414
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,519
continuously move ourselves towards as

415
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,480
we go down this road

416
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:58,959
map. The key lesson is don't give up.

417
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,199
That resiliency is the single most

418
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,320
important trait and you're going to have

419
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,279
to pull rabbits out of hats over and

420
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,920
over again in a startup. And as long as

421
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,839
you are still willing to reach your hand

422
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,480
into the hat and find another rabbit,

423
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,480
you should keep going.
