1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,240
all right guys almost a year ago we

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,359
filmed this video which is insane um but

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,599
yeah almost a year ago this pretty viral

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,200
clip was birth of me crying during the

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,719
last time we filmed this when in your

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,440
life were you the happiest and when in

7
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,440
your life were you the

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,560
saddest so probably when I was eight but

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
ni I'm

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,039

upset start

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,160
crying that's so crazy I instantly

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,200
started crying talk about being 8 years

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,520
old so basically what we're going to do

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
today is a video series that we do

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,920
called Truth or eat and it's becoming a

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
video series with this video because

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,680
this is the second part correct um and

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
what we're going to do is we need to eat

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,120

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,359
to suffer with questions so I need to be

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,320

passes while you are trying to eat your

38
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,720
food you you will be asked one of the

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,240
invasive questions we have printed out

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,960

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,360
how many minutes it takes you to eat is

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,840

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
until your you have to eat all your food

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,880
in front of you in order to stop the

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
question asking all right the second

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Matt starts eating this video is going

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,560
to start you want to sit in the middle

50
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,520
yeah that's the point now you you look

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,840

it

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,000
you where you just like start scarfing

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,480
down the food like a [ __ ] wolf scarf

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,800
that reminds me of the winter retire

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,959
item you can

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,120
wear okay freak chug jug CH such a weird

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,560
word if you think about it

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,000
chug and oh my God we're weird that was

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,480
me being you that's why we said the same

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,800
thing I like we're like doing this like

65
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,720
thing here all right 1 minute minute

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,480
burer down question number one what is

67
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,560
the worst piece of content of you on the

68
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,080
internet that if you could erase

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,080
entirely you would get rid of I uh I

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,200
have like five Instagram accounts that I

71
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,480
made when I was like anywhere between

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,360
the age of 8 to I'd say 13 14 and I

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,120
would probably banish those off of the

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,920
internet just another day at baseball

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,480
just another day not fun yeah it is I

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,840
know that this question wasn't for Chris

77
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,200
either but I feel like if you were to

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,920
answer it he'd definitely say his like

79
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,040

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,440
anyone ever that's not you which is like

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,720

who any argument I ever have or any

212
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,360
person I disagree with whether it's

213
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,000
Chris whether anything you say if you

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,960
argue with someone I'm not going to

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,360
agree with you not at all very wow Nick

216
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,360
that's like hurtful I don't believe that

217
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,080
okay you don't have to believe it that's

218
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,000
actually crazy like an outside person

219
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,479
yeah just anybody that like if I

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,760
disagree with somebody Nick actually

221
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,039
instead of being like Oh that's my

222
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,120
brother I should agree with him plays

223
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,000
the logic C well you're not going to get

224
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,919
that you're right if you're just my

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,599
brother correct and I don't expect to

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,200
you just don't if you're wrong in a

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,959
scenario and someone else is right

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,959
they're right never wrong

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,160
okay 10 seconds stop his very little

230
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,760
fries left so probably isn't going to go

231
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,040
to a question five last question for

232
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,160
Matt what's a moment in your life that

233
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
you are most ashamed

234
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
of

235
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,560
no I don't want to

236
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,120
know I'd rather eat a brick than answer

237
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,040
that question that's why that's

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,279
literally why I asked that one I knew we

239
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,360
didn't want to answer what are you most

240
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,120
ashamed of I don't think you're filled

241
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,360
with much shame don't rub my no I'm just

two now

244
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,880
no I wouldn't say I have a specific

245
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,519
moment but anytime that I just lacked

246
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,120
confidence to do things that I wanted to

247
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,120
I didn't like that answer

248
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,000
that really didn't clarify a moment of

249
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,560
time I want a specific moment that you

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,640
are ashamed of what Mato did I've never

251
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,160

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,680

expect things I don't want your kids to

328
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,199

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,360
kids to grow up humble and appreciative

333
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,800
for everything and even if I'm not like

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,480

sometimes like if it's like 6:00 a.m.

543
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,480
and I'm like in my bed yesterday I was

544
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,600
literally crying last night because I

545
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,080
saw a video of a little kid and he went

546
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,080
back to the school that he used to go to

547
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,679
and the kids lined up to hug him yeah

548
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,720
and it just reminded me our youth and

549
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,840
when you're kids there's so much less

550
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
judgment from other people and it

551
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,760
matters to you less what other people

552
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,440
think of you and that you're not

553
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,320
thinking about like other people in like

554
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,960
such an intense and deep level you just

555
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,039
know who you like like to be around you

556
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
love going to school and you're just

557
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,840
like a happy little kid so that's why

558
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,360
it's like seeing videos of kids like

559
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,679
happy to be around each other is so

560
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,559
devastating cuz they're also going to

561
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,279
like not go to that school anymore like

562
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,520
not be friends at some point and it's

563
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,520
like

564
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:28,159
sad 3 2 1 Taco down Taco down question

565
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,799
number two what is the biggest lie you

566
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,200
have ever never told your parents I'm

567
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,720
straight cuz Mom and Dad have been

568
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,840
watching too many videos recently so

569
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,080
like they're guaranteed going to see

570
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,080
this don't know if I've told this story

571
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,880
on the Internet or not before I'm really

572
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,080
scared me too I like chills I know when

573
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,360
we were younger whenever I would log on

574
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,440
to Clash of

575
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,039
Clans I told this story I owe mom money

576
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,000
for that then I still haven't paid her

577
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,520
back but I used to every single time I'd

578
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,159
log on to Clash of Clans it would like

579
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,360
give me gems and I'd be like yeah like

580
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,640
it's a hack like I like I I jail broke

581
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,919
the game like it's a hack and every

582
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,440
single time I was going on I was going

583
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,520
to the store and then hitting gems and

584
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,960
it was like charging my mom's credit

585
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:14,480
card and then actually she got like a

586
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,679
$700 bank statement from like iTunes and

587
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,640
she showed it to us three and she was

588
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,360
like is this you guys and we were like

589
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,960
no that is none of us and I didn't know

590
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,240
like that's absolutely not meh no I

591
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,960
think you're being

592
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,200
hacked um and then we all went with her

593
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,880
to the bank and I remember sitting in

594
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,679
the room seeing her tell the person who

595
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
works at the bank that it wasn't any of

596
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,400
us and that like her cards got hacked

597
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,679
and then fully canceled her cards and

598
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,640
got new card numbers and it was me who

599
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,440
spent the money on it I owe my not only

600
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,080
did I do that and cause that stress to

601
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,240
Mom but I also owe her like 700 bucks do

602
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,320

603
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,720
haven't paid her back how old were we

604
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,960

characters

616
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,799
question number three what's a memory

617
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,600
you wish you could erase forever my

618
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,679
genuine and honest answer to this

619
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,440
question is nothing because I think that

620
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,000
your memories and like like I would have

621
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,640
the same answer if like oh if you could

622
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,880
time travel to the Past would you

623
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,520
absolutely not like I think changing a

624
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
erasing a memory or changing the past it

625
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,080
[ __ ] with like the butterfly effect

626
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,559
like if I forgot something that I like

627
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,320
want to forget all right all right all

628
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,240
right kill this [ __ ] what's the real

629
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,440
answer the real answer is probably when

630
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,799
I was probably like seven or eight and I

631
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,720
thought I had to fart and I probably I

632
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:06,760
[ __ ] in my bed and I crab walked out of

633
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,440
it and I had to throw my pants away or

634
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,399
that or I was in my favorite that one

635
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,960
won't affect the butterfly no it won't

636
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:17,320
that one get rid of that one later and

637
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,880
then another time that one actually

638
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,279
might crucially affect I might [ __ ] my

639
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,080
pants later by accident cuz I'm not as

640
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,320
cautious but one time I was super sick

641
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,480
as a kid and I was like probably like

642
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,919
nine and and I was wearing my favorite

643
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,880
Scooby-Do matching pajamas set and I was

644
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,440
[ __ ] my brains out I was sick and I

645
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,279
was screaming and crying I was like Mom

646
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm going to throw up and she came in

647
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,279
the room while I was [ __ ] on the

648
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,440
toilet and like held the barrel and was

649
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:48,600
like sitting by me and like consoling me

650
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,200
and I threw up all over my pajamas and

651
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,279
her while while I was [ __ ] I wish I

652
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,320
could erase that memory for me and mom

653
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,960
cuz it was I was a disgrace what's the

654
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,919
