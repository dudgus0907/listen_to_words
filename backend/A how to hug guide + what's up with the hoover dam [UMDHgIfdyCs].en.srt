remember when potato was like not not in

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
the tents you just used it that was okay

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,780
I'm just talking like in like 2016 when

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,520
people were just like me and potatoes

104
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,320
like crazy like everything had to do

105
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,840
with potatoes and they're like oh I'm

106
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,080
like you're a potato like I I really

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,900
like I hated with potatoes potato okay I

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,120
hated the potato hype seriously that's

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,860
it I hated working at a grocery store do

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,900
you know what I mean then potatoes had

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,360
such a severe all the different potatoes

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,979
I got so used to it like I could tell a

113
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,900
russet from a regular I just made

114
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,660
everything roasted potatoes every

115
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,580
potatoes

116
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,100
mostly apples too and if they were all

117
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,800
red they're all going the same way

118
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,900
that's crazy I was so good at my [ __ ]

119
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,720
job yeah except you were [ __ ] skin

120
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,720
and

121
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I

122
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,400
genuinely was probably the best employee

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,680
at the grocery store they had ever seen

124
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,780
in their life and I think that's why

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Jesus Christ blessed me with the

126
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,020
position of becoming a YouTuber and

127
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,500
being able to do this for the rest of my

128
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,139
life because I took my Star Market job

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,300
as serious as the [ __ ] FBI I went in

130
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,919
that hoe trying to figure it out and I

131
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,620
was just getting people their groceries

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,840
I don't think anyone was ever I think

133
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,100
Pod episode about that would be really

134
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,800
good

135
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,900

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,100

I don't want to say it say it it's

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,000
embarrassing why I was thinking of

143
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,120
dandelions and I'm like what are like

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,440

injected to be put down a puppy like I

196
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:29,099
blind hairless and crooked and I'd be

197
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,199
calling it a puppy yeah I call all dogs

198
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,080

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,200
puppies are like puppies is a word if

202
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,839
you say it too much it just sounds weird

203
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,240
puppies puppies

204
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,220
I just say oh puppy to any dog like it'd

205
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,320
be literally withering away and I'd be

206
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,339
like oh poppy sometimes I noticed about

207
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,200
Nick

208
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,420
we we met someone the other day the

209
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,180
other day for first time at a party and

210
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,860
like when meeting people or like

211
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,140
reintroducing it I know I know what he's

212
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,120
I know what he's gonna say Nick always

213
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,320
goes like this like you like you and me

214
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,360
walk up to the person and go oh what's

215
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,040
up you're like I'll go oh what's up nice

216
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,339
to meet you in the Nicholas hi nice to

217
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,339
meet you

218
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,740
salutes and then shakes

219
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,720
was it for fun is it aside

220
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,339
it's honestly to break the awkwardness

221
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,980
because when people meet us I'm usually

222
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,839
like for some reason it's not like the

223
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,940
person's picking I'm just usually the

224
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,019
last person to say hi I don't know how

225
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,899
because you're like the least

226
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,019
approachable I feel like okay that's

227
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,140
awesome that's a nice fun fact about me

228
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,140
um

229
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,080
you really just said oh you're a [ __ ]

230
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,240
beast no one is no one can go near no I

231
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,040
just feel like if I was at an event

232
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,660
where all three of us were that'd just

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,279
be the last one that you'd approach you

234
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,720
would be the most intimidating to me yes

235
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,080
because you just look like you're gonna

236
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,839
like rip myself like a ravaging mutant

237
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,399
scene yes you look you look angry that

238
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,320
was so funny no it's more of like you

239
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,580
just have the most like like you like

240
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,019
I'll stand there and I'll be like this I

241
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,040
got the most grit and you're just like

242
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,040
this you'll be sitting there like

243
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,380
[Music]

244
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,420
imagine you meet someone and they go to

245
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,660
you and they go hey what's up yeah no

246
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,800
it's not like a salute it's like it's

247
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,600
two fingers it's two figures

248
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,980
outro Trend yeah like the people like

249
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,120
yeah play their outro and then leave the

250
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,800
room and then go like that and then like

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,899
walk out the door nick does that before

252
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,820
it's simply to break the awkwardness of

253
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,019
like they looked at Matt said hi looked

254
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,940
at you said hi I'm just like uh like

255
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,300
it's like a it's like in addition to

256
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,579
like but I do Converse use a lot of

257
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,260
people because like when I go like this

258
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,880
I think they think I'm like they see my

259
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,980
arm go up so they think I'm gonna go for

260
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,779
a hug but then I that's like this first

261
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,279
and then I go to shake their hand and

262
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,720
then they start to go for the hug so I

263
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,820
have to like pull my arms I hate the

264
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,380
in-between like oh it's so weird I'm

265
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,380
mostly a handshake guy

266
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm a hugger for sure unless it's a

267
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,060
straight man because I'm just like I

268
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,360
don't know where your level of is like

269
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,060
no that's how I feel about like meeting

270
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,260
guys that have girlfriends like I'll hug

271
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,060
the guy and then I'll shake his

272
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,740
girlfriend's hand yeah I always do that

273
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,480
you know what I mean that's such a [ __ ]

274
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,760
thing though like if you're if you're a

275
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,140
man and you have a girlfriend

276
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,519
no I know you don't care what I'm saying

277
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,959
like if you're a guy who has a

278
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,480
girlfriend and you're scared of like the

279
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,740
girl like hugging a guy that she meets

280
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,980
like yeah

281
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,620
you're an insecure loser I agree with

282
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,300
themselves I agree

283
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,880
um but but it's never like I feel like

284
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,320
like that like the hugging thing when

285
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,240

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,140
pumpkin fun if you were to hug a girl

how are you hugging a girl right

293
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,339
over the over her should like is she

294
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,079
much taller than you no yeah what was

295
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,700
that you can't do like because you're

296
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,560
most suffocating most of the time the

297
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,300
girls hands go over and then the guy's

298
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,380
hands go under yes I know that but like

299
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,380
when it's like friend level

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,660
say hypothetically you're anyone new

301
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,760
that I'm eating if you're a guy and I if

302
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,160

and then one armed hug with hands in

309
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,459
between yes yeah I hate when Stripes

310
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,180
that's my least favorite why why I just

311
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,980
don't like it so broey like like I'm

312
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,420
never doing that ever okay I'm usually

313
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,300
like hey

314
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,980
who's here okay okay I wouldn't let go

315
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,579
that slow you're just far from me it's

316
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,540
like I go like this

317
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:17,279
yeah like yeah I guess yes

318
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,560
so that's Bros right

319
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,560
if I'm hugging a girl yeah I always try

320
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,620
to go above their shoulders I don't like

321
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,079
both my arms

322
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,540
I feel like I feel like arms is a girl

323
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,300
that's like that wants like is flirty

324
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,459
yes get away but like also it totally

325
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,880
depends with the girls throat where most

326
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,019
of the time I'm just gonna shake

327
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,240
most of the time I just want to shake

328
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,220
your hand get away get away get away I

329
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,139
need my space I don't know hugging is

330
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,839
weird as [ __ ] because at some point you

331
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,940
do like figure eight

332
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,399
like what not figuring not figure eight

333
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,019
but like yeah like an X just hugging you

334
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,899
right there I think hugging people you

335
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,940
don't like is like really scary yeah I

336
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,260
don't like touching people and I don't

337
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,519
like someone and I'm hugging them I

338
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,660
always feel like my feet are like

339
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,459
further away

340
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,980
like it sounded like a top hug you know

341
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:10,800
what I mean like a lean yeah yeah I'm

342
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,800
not trying to be like yeah you know oh

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,180
my God hugging is so strange it is

344
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,980
that's why I'm saying I'm mostly a

345
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,240
handshake guy unless I would never I

346
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,220
don't like the idea of like hugging

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,620
people that are on like stranger level

348
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,120
