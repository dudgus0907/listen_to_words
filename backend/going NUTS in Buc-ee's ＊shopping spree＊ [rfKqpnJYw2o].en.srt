55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
So, I have to stand like this. You want

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,479
All gummy [ __ ] Unless it's like very

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,399
very branded to be a different flavor

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,479

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080

really like banana taffy. That's dark

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
chocolate espresso beans. I think we

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,319
should fill one of these with the [ __ ]

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,480

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,480
with Cheetos.

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,640

walk in here and say, "Shoot and kill

Yes. All the same.

219
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,319
Making this ridiculous hat is like

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680

Oh, you got the sandwiches.

want?

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,880
One, two.

233

Feel good about that. I love it here.

237
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
Nick, I thought you grabbed it. Wait,

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,000
why would I grab it? I said help. Hey,

245
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,560
Yes. Look at this. I almost just pulled

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
a hamstring.

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,959

Nick. All right. Oh, I just Why? I tried

250
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,160
to flip off public. They don't know what

251
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,959
clothes, and when I have a kid, they're

255
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,399
going to only be wearing That's the

256
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,279
weirdest [ __ ] I've ever heard in my

257
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,279
life. Did you just hear that? Missed it.

258
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,760
Unfortunately,

259
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,519
he's only exclusively letting his kid

260
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
wear Buckyy's merch when he has a baby

261
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
and I'm going to buy it all right now.

262
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,480
That dude, that baby would probably

263
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
smell like pull pork forever. All right.

264
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
Best thing ever. Are you not getting

265
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,120
anything over here? No. What do you want

266
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,240
to try? A B waffle maker. There's a B

267
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,519
pillow pet. I'm good. There's something

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
This isn't going to entertain some

269
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,760
people. No. Let's go, bro. Come on. Oh

some ice on the ground, Bucky.

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,880
Guys, this Bucky onesie has pockets. We

281
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,120
didn't really get much else other than

282
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,560
uh what you saw.

283
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
Are the sandwiches as good as you

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,800
standard pull pork or is it like got

288
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,800
some flavor to it?

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,480
It's probably good.

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I'm just so tired. What? Mine's upside

291
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,920

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,839
Oh my god.

295
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Can you stop smacking people with pull

296
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,279
pork sandwiches? Dude, I just want them

297
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,360

298
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,200
they're two. I was about to freak out.

299
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,600
Dude, pull pork sandwiches have like

300
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,760
like crawled. They've prowled their way

301
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,760
into the top one of my foods. Like I was

302
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,399
going to say like man oh man. How about

303
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560

304
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,160
That one was That's unbeatable actually.

my life. So good. We got so much.

307
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,920
Rank this one one through 10. This is in

308
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,920
the two slot, I think.

309
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:26,480
What? Hawaii number one. Hawaii number

310
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,040

311
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,399
number two on a good day. Yeah. This is

312
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,440
like a Bies. Really? What?

313
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,760
I don't know. The way you were looking

314
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,000
at that a second ago. Lowkey a B miss.

315
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,440
What? Are you serious? Not as good as it

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
could be. Nick, you were just literally

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,079
falling in love with this thing 30

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,519
seconds ago. I'm so [ __ ] tired right

319
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,320
now. Also. Mhm.

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,800
ones on. It's like my realest fantasy

323
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,200
come to life. Dude, you're sick. Freaked

324
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,279

325
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Why? I don't like looking at you without

326
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,360
the hood. Put it all together for me. I

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,040
wish it was a full zip so I could like

328
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,040
Do you have a tail? You have brown legs.

329
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,240
Oh my god. Hey, shake your ass. No. Come

330
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,399
on. You can have to do a little shake.

331
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,880
Oh, okay. Just sit down. Yeah. Like

332
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,720

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,320
Bucky in a hoodie in a

335
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,360
shirt? Deep breath. Is this Bucky in a

336
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,519
hoodie? And then this is Bucky in a

Fudge. The other fudge. Did she give you

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,200

that. Got to try this. I got to see if

345
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,839
this is as good as I remember it was. I

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,320
can feel my temples squeezing right now.

347
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,240
What? Oh, when you chew. I can't feel my

348
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,880

349
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:11,639

350
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,639
No, it's really good. Doesn't matter.

351
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,720
It's good. Like glazed little It smells

352
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,959
like an amusement park, but like in a

353
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,160
good way. Glazed little what? Glazed

354
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,560
little almonds. Yep, that'll do it.

356
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,120

357
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,639
Dude, that's the craziest thing ever

358
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
said on her channel. I can't even

359
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
believe that.

360
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,199
I don't even know what to say. I feel a

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,279
little violated. I don't even know what

362
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,240
that would mean. I'm not trying to think

363
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,399
about it too

364
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,199

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,519
magic f

366
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:50,480
word. That is not the magic f word. I

367
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,000
can't say the magic f word.

368
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:59,959
