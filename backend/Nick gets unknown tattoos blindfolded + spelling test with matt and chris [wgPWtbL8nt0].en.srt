that shouldn't be the hardest decision

92
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,400
that should be like the most like

93
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,919
thought out decision but that's not for

me and Chris decided

177
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,900

ask you to spell certain words on camera

179
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,820
real funny

180
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,339
so we're just gonna ask you how to spell

181
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,620
some words that we picked out okay yeah

182
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,740
but every single word you get right will

183
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,360
