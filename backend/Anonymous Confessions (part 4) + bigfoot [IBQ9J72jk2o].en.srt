normally and it was cold and I said that

106
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,960
so that when we went upstairs to grab a

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960

flown away if your sister was a good

337
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,560

couch hit the wall leaving a knee sized

375
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,199
dented hole in the wall and started to

376
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,800
cry not because it hurt but because I

377
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,959
