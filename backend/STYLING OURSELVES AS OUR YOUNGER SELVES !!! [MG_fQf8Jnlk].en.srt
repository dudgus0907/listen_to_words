1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,020
first question on your mind is probably

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,359
Nick

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,160
why are you completely alone

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,160
and it's because I have a surprise

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,220
so if you guys are unaware me Matt and

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,300
Chris because of our mom she used to

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:39,239
dress us up we had an unreal amount of

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,280
drip as children like unwarranted levels

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,500
of drip so for this week's video I'm

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
going to be styling Matt and Chris as

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,360
them young as their younger selves as a

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,980
surprise they're gonna have no idea that

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,300
I'm doing this she got us a bunch of

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,800
clothes and to help tell the difference

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,379
between us not tell the difference but

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,059
like in individualize us they all had

17
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,559
our names like sewn on the side so I

18
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,960
have a bunch of options and then I'm

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,000
going to choose from these old pieces of

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,159
our clothes and then style Us in new

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,520
outfits and there's this little

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,740
blue sweater with a sailboat on it which

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,600

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,960

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,180

since I last talked to you guys at the

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,820
beginning of this video but I gathered

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
everything

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,060
that I need

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,500
to complete this video I've been

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,420
shopping and everything is finally here

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,480
so I'm going to show you the photo of

48
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,620
them in it as a kid or the actual item

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
of it like

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,700
as a kid and then I'll show you the

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,120
photo as well

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,440
good word so

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,540
as in the beginning of this video I

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,760
showed you guys like a little yellow and

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,980
blue rugby shirt that was Matt's and it

56
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,620
had his name on it so I went on polo and

57
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,660
I found it in his size right here so I'm

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,580
gonna open it

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,660
and it's this is just like the one I

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,800
showed you guys at the beginning of this

61
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,420
video

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,959
which isn't necessarily something Matt

63
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,780
would by himself now but I have this

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,599
right matches the other one and I went

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,280
to CVS and I printed photos I'm also I

66
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,680
also have a photo of Matt and our older

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,879
brother Justin with of him in that shirt

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,980
and then I have a photo of Matt and

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,900
Chris in that shirt

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,280
and another photo of Matt and Chris in

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,140
that shirt so I'll frame some of them

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,180
and give them to him with this so that's

73
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,560
one Ben as you guys know with Chris and

74
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,560
his brand and everything his love for

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,239
the color orange he always had this R

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,340
and R and John ever since he was a kid

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,920
insert photo of him almost in this exact

78
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,319
hoodie so I scavenged the world for eBay

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,120
and I found this which is super similar

80
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,519
to the one of him in that photo so I'm

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,140
gonna give him this and here's the photo

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,659
that I'm gonna frame as well I'm gonna

83
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,560
put it on the screen

84
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,540
which you guys may have seen on

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,180

90
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,099

92
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,019
having a good time Chris looks confused

93
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,019
and Matt is bawling his eyes out and so

94
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,720

but I'm gonna put the photo at the

104
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,739
bottom so they get the clothes and

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,479
they're like what the [Â __Â ] is this and

106
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,280

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,940
Chris and this framed photo of Chris I'm

110
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,680
putting them at the bottom of the bag so

111
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,600
he gets the hoodie first and is confused

112
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,280
or he might even grab the hoodie first

113
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,840
and be like oh my God I remember this

114
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,220
and then see the photos and then you

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
know full circle moments are at the

116
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,940
bottom

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,100
hoodie on the top bag number two done

118
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,800
the mat I'm really excited for because

119
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,479
Chris was easy right like Chris had like

120
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,520
he has orange she had that hoodie like

121
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,900
he was very obvious about it but there's

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,340
a lot of things that Matt used to wear

123
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,500
as a kid like when we were babies

124
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,020
they're like he looks so cool in and he

125
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,820
knows that and he has like a very

126
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,680
particular style so I know he never

127
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,240
would buy this for himself so I'm happy

128
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm able to get it for him so that he

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,540
can like relate it to when he was a kid

130
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,680
and then own it and be happy about it

131
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,940
because I know it's not something he'd

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,919
pick up for himself but he'll be happy

133
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,960
to have it get back to Matt these two

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,000
