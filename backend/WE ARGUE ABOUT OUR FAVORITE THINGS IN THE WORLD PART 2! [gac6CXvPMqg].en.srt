love pineapple but I'm good so buy it

334
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,860
pre-cut

335
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,079
in the little plastic tins not nearly as

336
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,480
good those people don't have passion you

337
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,800
know people who works people who work at

338
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,120
a grocery store that cut up fruits and

339
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
put them in the little plastic bins like

340
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,660
the little to go containers they don't

341
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,040
have the [ __ ] passion I would have if

342
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,040
I was cutting it and I don't think it

343
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,540
does what do you even mean by look I

344
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,660
mean you have to adjust I don't like I

345
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,660
don't

346
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,980
I don't produce is in an intimate thing

347
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,980
for me

348
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,820
there's a bruised Apple I might pick

349
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,800
another one I might see an apple and

350
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,279
like be like oh like I definitely want

351
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,600
that one or like a pack of raspberries

352
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,860
I might see a pack of raspberries and

353
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,120
there's a couple mushy ones I'm like you

354
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,860
need a different home that's not mine

355
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,100
and then I'll find a pack of raspberries

356
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,660
that I want so I think that on all

357
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,800
circumstances they cut up fruit and

358
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,860
stuff I don't think those people are

359
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,779
taking as much time and care and care to

360
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,920
take out the gross pieces they're just

361
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,079
throwing it in the container they don't

362
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,259
they it's by batch and then they put it

363
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,259
out

364
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,560
so anything cuts at the [ __ ] fruit

365
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,019
Master no I'm talking about like The

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,579
Raspberries like they're not picking

367
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:06,020
them yeah no not those I'm talking about

368
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,020
the pre-cut ones oh well

369
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,699
because I just I look like if I if I

370
