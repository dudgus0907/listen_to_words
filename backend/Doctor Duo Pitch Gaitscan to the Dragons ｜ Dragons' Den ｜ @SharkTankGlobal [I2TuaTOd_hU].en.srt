to measure foot function and ultimately

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,719
foot dysfunction there's a plethora of

13
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,320
research that supports that the foot

14
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,600
directly implicates and causes problems

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,640
in many satellite anatomical location

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,879
such as the ankle the knee the hip and

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,440
the lower back how this system works is

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,320
uh we sell the gate scan unit to top

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
Professionals in the country they have

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,520
their patients walk across this computer

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,159
chip 4,000 sensors in this mat send

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,759
information into the computer with a

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,400
touch of a button the information is

24
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,520
modem through cyberspace to our

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,119
laboratory where foot Specialists will

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,479
construct an orthopedic insert uh that

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,880
will help to alleviate problems in the

28
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,360
foot and in doing so will help to to

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,119
reduce toxin in the whole kinetic chain

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,960

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,040
helps to straighten your toe out this is

profit at all for 3 years theopus is

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,240
determined to get to the bottom of

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,000
it I I'm now very suspicious about some

186
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,520
of these numbers I want you to break

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,599
down the £500,000

188
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,240
that you generated last year right I

189
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,280
want I want you break down where you

190
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,520
generated it from okay and I want you to

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,159
break down where you spent it okay 4,000

192
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,159
orthodics is that 180,000 y

193
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,000
180,000 um sales of the gate scans y

194
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,919
£210,000

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,639
y

196
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,759
and then we have we put hold two big

197
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,400
large seminars but we did we only made

198
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,599
£20,000 from them guys that makes four

199
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,599
410,000 where's the other 90,000 come

200
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,680
from and the accounting procedures

201
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,360
basically include Northern Ireland and

202
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,919
Northern Ireland is not the territory

203
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,120
that we're we're talking about today

204
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,240
we've fragmented Northern Ireland into

205
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,319
its separate company so I I have a

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,519
Northern Ireland company Irish company

207
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,240
with with shareholders and I have a

208
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,919
United Kingdom company at the time

209
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,320
recently we've just what are you

210
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,800
offering me investment in United Kingdom

211
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,800
excluding the northern Irish

212
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,560
territory unbelievably Dave and Travis

213
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,080
have left it until now to reveal that

214
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,519
although they've been boasting about a

215
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,880
watertight distribution deal covering UK

216
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,399
and Ireland they're not including the

217
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,360
Irish territories in the deal the

218
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,399
dragons are incred

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,519
ulous why have you hied the other

220
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,680
business off what's behind that

221
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,000
structure Ireland was where I started

222
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,000
and Ireland grew very very fast and it's

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,120
an example of where I I had the capacity

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,279
to infiltrate the marketplace easier

225
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,440
because it's smaller we do profitable

226
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,720
very yeah how much profit is that making

227
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,120
uh it is making about

228
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,399
117,000 last year did you somewhere get

229
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,560
an impression that we were

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,600
daed is that what you thought you know

231
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,320
these guys are d I know I know you're

232
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,200
smart shares in the dud company keep all

233
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,560
our shares in a profitable company if

234
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,279
you if you were to look at pure

235
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,160
potential if you looked at Ireland

236
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,720
there's 3 million people we do 600

237
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,000
orthodtic a month if you look at the

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,079
United Kingdom we're doing 300 a month

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,200
but there's 60 million people but why do

240
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,240
you not put that into the pot again I

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,959
like to keep a clear-cut dichotomy

242
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,880
between you want to own it all and make

243
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,240
profit and use my money to exploit and

244
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,279
make more profit for you no no it look

245
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm not going to say that we're not

246
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,240
going to be thankful to get the money

247
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,760
cuz it's going to help us roll overow to

248
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,760
sales strategy but we need we clearly

249
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,120
need direction we're in front of two

250
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,120
guys very professional and all I've

251
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,040
heard is the fact that you're not

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
salespeople you're very very good

253
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,360
salespeople and Travis I thought your

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,040
presentation was fantastic you gave us

255
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,360
words like

256
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,279
satellite anatomical locations you then

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,800
went on to say taxing in the whole

258
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:28,640
kinetic chain your pitch was fantastic

259
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,200
but the bottom line is all you've got is

260
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,800
an individual ually made shoe

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
insert I don't know I don't know much

262
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,760
about marketing am I a good salesperson

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you don't know marketing satellite

264
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,880
anatomical locations I've done it in

265
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,120
I've done the whole kinetic chain

266
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,760
together I've been there for years the

267
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,959
greatest mines in the whole of the

268
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,040
universe is in front of me I mean give

269
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,720
me a break if you're not a salesperson

270
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,880
what is I a salesperson I am a salesp

271
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,880
person but I'm not a mark honestly the

272
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,399
only Direction I can give you is to the

273
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,040
stairs because there's no way I'm going

274
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,279
to invest in this company I've I've

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,279
heard enough so I'm not investing so I'm

276
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,000
out the dragons are rra in arms furious

277
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,600
with the gates scan team's tactics in

278
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,360
the den Duncan vantine has made his

279
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,160
feelings perfectly clear Richard Farley

280
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,399
has also made his mind

281
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,399
up the puzzle that you're probably

282
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
trying to figure out and I've been

283
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,880
trying to figure out is why it works in

284
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,519
Ireland but you can't get it to work

285
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,320
here and I think that's why you want us

286
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,680
involved because that really is a puzzle

287
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,639
now you haven't been able to figure that

288
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,079
out I don't think I could figure that

289
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,839
out so I'm I'm dropping out as well but

290
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,560
good luck thank you I'm

291
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,120
out and to let you know where I am I've

292
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,720
lost confidence in you so I'm afraid if

293
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,600
I've lost confidence there is absolutely

294
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,360
no way I'm going to invest so I'm out

295
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,800
sorry to hear that thank you and I'll

296
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,279
just tell you at the end of the day all

297
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,240
you have is an individually made insert

298
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,920
company and that isn't good enough

299
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,680
you're a sales agent nothing else I

300
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,160
can't invest in a sales Agency for an

301
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,160
insert for a shoe so I'm

302
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,040
out Dave and Travis's pitch has

303
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,720
disintegrated with three more dragons

304
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,600
competing to declare themselves out it's

305
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,399
left to theopus to have the final word

306
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,399
on the turmoil that's ensued in the

307
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,480
den your

308
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,279
pitch resembles something out of delboy

309
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,760
Trotter's opportunities book you have

310
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,800
try to play the three card trick you've

311
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,320
been moving the the lady around from

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,120
left to right right to left you really

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,839
have not done your business any Justice

314
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,120
by the approach that you've taken here

315
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,920
today you're wasting my

316
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,040
time I will not be

317
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,320
investing so I'm out thanks for your

318
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,399
time okay

319
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,360
byebye after a polished start Dave and

320
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,360
Travis have felt the full wroth of the

321
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,360
dragons and they leave the den

322
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360
empty-handed
