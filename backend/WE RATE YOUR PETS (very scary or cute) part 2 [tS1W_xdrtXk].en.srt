22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,199
crustation what the [ __ ] is that and why

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,239

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,399
arm I've never seen a really small girl

25
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,760

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,759
ass slug or something what the [ __ ] is

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,080

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,960
for love I cannot love that like that's

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,600
disgusting bro the fact that like you're

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,960
comfortable enough to even name that

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,159
like Jerry is like appalling to me like

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,119
be Gary I just said that I agree you

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,560

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,399
it I literally had it on the edge of my

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,680
no I think [ __ ] nasty some weird [ __ ]

42
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,799
Matt would do when we were kids like

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
just own a slug and name it or something

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,520
it's not even like a hermit crab a

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,719
hermit crab I could G that's a full slug

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,040
in a shell ridiculous what's a slug in a

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,640
shell called a snail oh that's a snail

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,479
yeah wait cuz it did have a shell so it

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,719
is a snail yeah Google it kid no if

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,159
you're going to [ __ ] talk out of your

51
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,000
ass at least turn around so I can hear

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,200
you better

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,439
what is the difference

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,759
between a slug and a snil it all comes

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,400
down to Shell yeah a snail a it's shage

56
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,680
for sure shage 100% like a slug is snail

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,120
has a shell and a slug does not correct

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,360
correct but can a snail like leave it

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,480
shell right and become a slug what so it

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,040
could be the same slug can be a snail

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,680
snails lowkey snails lowkey be slugging

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
see this makes me really sick because

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,760
I've held a snail before and been like

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,319
so cute but then I'm appalled by a slug

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,920
so maybe I'm just judging them based off

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,599
of their shell and I shouldn't do that I

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,480
think snails are more tolerable sorry

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
sorry it's okay because you can like you

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,120
can um like you can grab them by the

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,519
shell you're not just feeling gush and

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,560
mush oh my God how one time I stepped on

72
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,480
a slug and I slid on the ground my foot

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,720
