25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
with something it was too last minute to

26
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,920
do anything super crazy but I bought a

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,280
thousand balloons on off Amazon and

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,640
Chris's room literally smells horribly

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,200
like it reeks of like latex balloons so

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,680

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,400

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,840

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,679
physical alteration I know this close

387
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,880

388
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,280
thing where you pop the water bottle cap

389
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,600

my ear people are so stupid and

391
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,640
I fully one of my one of our friends

392
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,280
sent me a old high school memory of me

393
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,080
like jumping down six stairs and I like

394
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,120
look like I'm trying to be like cool and

395
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,480
it's like the worst video you'll ever

396
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,480

397
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,280
like you see me like load up and then I

398
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,520
