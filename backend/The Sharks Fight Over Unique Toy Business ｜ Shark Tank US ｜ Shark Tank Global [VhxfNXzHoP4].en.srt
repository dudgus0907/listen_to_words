00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,040
First into the tank is Nikki Pope with a

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,839
money-saving idea to help parents

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,839
entertain their kids.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,240
I'm Nikki Pope. I live in Los Angeles,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,520
California, and my company is Toy Guru.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,800
Look what I have.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
Yay.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
I have 13 nieces and nephews, and they

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
absolutely love playing with toys. I

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
call them my playtime professionals. The

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,880
problem is they get bored with those

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
toys really quickly. That is what

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,719
inspired me and my husband to create Toy

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,040
Guru. Toy Guru offers a coste effective

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
way not only for parents to declutter

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
their homes, but to keep their kids

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,040
challenged and entertained. My husband

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
and I don't have any kids yet, but we

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,640
would definitely like to. And an

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
investment from the Sharks would mean

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
that we would have the stability we need

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,480
to start a family of our own. My dream

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,160
for my company is that every family who

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
has children who love to play with toys

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,359
will use Toy Guru. And I really hope the

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,359
sharks will help make that happen.

29
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,880
Hi guys, my name is Nikki. My company is

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,320
Toy Guru and I am asking for $100,000 in

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,320
exchange for 10% of my company. Toy Guru

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,079
solves a problem that millions of

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,400
families face every day. I have 11

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,520
brothers and sisters and I am lucky

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,240
enough to have 13 outstanding nieces and

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,840
nephews, all under the age of eight. One

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
thing that I've noticed is that my

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
siblings are purchasing toy after toy

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
for their kids. Their playrooms, their

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
living rooms, their bedrooms are

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,479
cluttered with toys that were purchased,

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
played with for a few weeks, and now are

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,320
left completely untouched. Toy Guru

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,280
solves that problem and more. My company

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,599
is the Netflix for toys. Consumers can

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
go to my website, pick a plan that's

47
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,720
right for them, fill their wish list

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
with toys that they would like to

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
receive, and I ship those toys right to

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
their door. The great thing about my

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
company is when their kids get bored

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
with or outgrow those toys, they just

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
throw them in the box, use the return

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,120
label that we provided, send them back

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,599
to us, and we send them their next box

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
of toys.

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,400
Can I just see your snail? I just want

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,200
to see what the quality is like.

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
Absolutely.

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
And how many toys are in your catalog?

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
We have over 300 different types of

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,360
toys. What is the servicing of it? You

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
know, the toys come back. Obviously,

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
kids are not the cleanest. So, you got

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,040
drool on the toys. You have bed bugs.

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
Would they have pee and poo on the toys?

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,239
Maybe. There has to be a process. People

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
have to be hired to do this

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,120
with our company. Uh the cleaning is the

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,480
most important. And so, the the toy gets

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
sanitized.

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
Shrink wrap it

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
and we shrink wrap it every time.

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
Who else is doing this, Nikki?

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,239
There is not another company that is

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,560
doing this.

77
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,440
So, Nikki, what about the damage?

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,760
In 6 months, we had zero toys that we

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,599
had to to completely replace. If a child

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,120
does break the toy, we sell it to the

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,400
member at a discounted cost.

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
Nikki, walk us through your business

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
model. How do you make money?

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,680
All of our members obviously pay a

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,840
monthly membership fee. We have plans

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
that start at $35 a month and they go

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
all the way up to $89 a month.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,280
That's a lot.

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,599
35 a month,

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,519
right?

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,920
And how many families pay you that? Um,

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
we did a soft launch with 500 members.

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,640
It was basically like a test launch.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,080
They were all paying $42 a month for a

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,760
box of toys that's worth over $200.

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
You're saying basically it cost them

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,280
about $500 a year.

98
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,519
Exactly. Which is great because the

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
average family spends anywhere between

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
12 and $1,400 a year.

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,400
And tell me again the cost per toy box

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,000
that you ship was $200, did you say? And

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,680
what's your cost on the toys that you're

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,200
shipping? On the box of toys, it's going

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,799
to be anywhere between 50 to $8590.

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
Two and a half months, you break even on

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
each customer.

108
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,120
That's exactly right.

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,560
Nikki, how do you scale it up? How do

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
you make this a big business?

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
All we need is more marketing, more

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
exposure. In the small amount of time

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,040
that we had our 500 customers, just by

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,479
word of mouth, we got a waiting list of

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
over a thousand people ready to sell.

116
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,199
Vicki, I think that's a great idea. Let

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,560
me ask you this. If the business begins

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,400
to grow, does it suck up a ton of cash?

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,320
Nikki, for every million dollars of

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
sales, how much do I have to put in to

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
buy inventory of toys?

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Just in toys.

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,400
Just in toys. $64,000. That's going to

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,199
cover a year of toys.

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,199
Okay, Nikki, I've heard enough.

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,080
The problem is you don't have a million

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,759
dollar business yet. You're asking me to

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,040
pay you as if your business is worth a

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,160
million, and it's not.

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
But I want to be an investor in it.

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
You have a good idea. This is

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
interesting.

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,000
So,

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,199
this is a leap of faith for me because I

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,240
have to think you're going to grow this

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
thing. Do you have any partners? You're

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
doing this on your own?

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
Um, my husband is a partner and then I

139
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
have um web designers and two online

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,960
marketers that are partnering with me.

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
How much do you own?

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,600
I own 10% of the company.

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,759
You own 10%.

144
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,720
Who owns the rest? Where's the other 90?

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
We all own 10% and my husband owns the

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
the bigger chunk of

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,479
which is how much?

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,759
He owns 50%.

149
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,400
Why does your husband own a bigger

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
chunk?

151
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
Um because I that's how we decided.

152
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,759
How happily married are you?

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,759
Um incredibly happily married.

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,600
Why would you who came up with this idea

155
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
give so much to your partner? Why?

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Um he's worked with me and blood, sweat,

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
and tears with me every day.

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
Do you have a prenuptual agreement?

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,639
No, we don't.

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Oh,

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,320
we were half and half when we started.

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
Okay. and you sold your piece to all

163
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,240
these others and you didn't take any

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
from him.

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
The way that we worked the company is we

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
wanted to make sure our family as a

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
whole had the the majority share. Okay.

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,560
But to Kevin's point then why didn't you

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
each give away some of your shares?

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
Um I don't know.

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,440
Um I've had a bad history of speaking to

172
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
people who don't have controlling of the

173
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,680
company.

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm out.

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,919
Nikki, you know, I I wish you owned

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,560
more, but nevertheless, I'd like to make

177
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,560
you an offer here.

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,759
I'll give you $100,000 for 35%.

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Rarely, Nikki, do I not ask for control

180
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,039
because I'm a control freak. But I trust

181
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
you. You know what you're doing. I can

182
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,680
help you immensely in the toy space.

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,759
Immensely.

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,319
Do you have the right to sell 35%,

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
Nikki?

186
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,440
Um, I have the right to do whatever I

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,479
want with the company. Yes.

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,919
I had my eye on you when I came in here.

189
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,840
I have my eye on you,

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
Nikki. You are the first person ever to

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,360
walk into the Shark Tank and actually be

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
attracted to him.

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
You know what? He's got a tough

194
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
exterior, but I'm a southern girl and I

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
knew I could get in.

196
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,240
She's right.

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,840
He's blushing. He is blushing.

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
He really is.

199
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,199
Nikki, I've made you an offer. What are

200
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
you going to do?

201
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,280
Nikki, just just before you you answer

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
that,

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Mark, I see this as an internet uh

204
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,840
logistics play. Would you be interested?

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,039
I'd like to get in on this one with you.

206
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
Would you be interested in putting up

207
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,440
more money?

208
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Absolutely.

209
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,800
Because I think really this key issue

210
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
for me, it's a website, social media.

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm in that world. But I think you got

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
to go faster than you're suggesting.

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,000
I agree 100%.

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,599
So Kevin's offering 100 for 35. I'm

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
thinking we raise more money.

216
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,520
What do you have in mind?

217
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:09,039
I was thinking 200 or 250 for maybe 35

218
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,400
or 40. I' I'd split 200 for 40. Okay.

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
Well, you just knocked me out. I was

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,000
going to offer a lot less.

221
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I'm out.

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,560
Two sharks are out. Nikki has an offer

223
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,360
from Kevin for $100,000 for 35% of her

224
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,120
company and another from Robert and Mark

225
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,360
for $200,000 for 40%.

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,399
I want you to know something about me. I

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,440
am Mr. Toy. I sold my company to Mattel.

228
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,839
I know it.

229
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,120
I lived in Fisher Price for a year.

230
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,120
Those toys are my friends. I speak toy.

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
I just think you need more capital.

232
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,760
You got to get going faster. That's

233
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,519
going to be your only advantage. And you

234
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
need someone with internet hyperrowth

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,800
experience.

236
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
Okay?

237
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
It wouldn't hurt to start partnering

238
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,440
with some of the toy companies, let me

239
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,120
tell you. And there's two that own 90%

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
and I know all their board members. Mark

241
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
and I are offering you 200,000

242
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
for 40%.

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
Okay.

244
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
Mr. Olirri is offering you 100,000 for

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
35%.

246
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,519
What are you going to do?

247
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,959
Where are you at relationship wise with

248
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,320
Fisher Price and Mattel?

249
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,720
They're never going to forget me. Put it

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,279
to you that way.

251
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you holding at your 100,000 for 35?

252
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm thinking I'm thinking.

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,959
Um I don't know if you'd be willing to

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
go up anymore on your number without

255
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,800
moving that percentage. Um

256
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
what's I compete with myself? What do

257
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,240
you want?

258
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,240
She wants you to bid against yourself.

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
Nikki, I don't think the relationship

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
with the toy companies

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
Oh, yeah.

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
Yeah. You don't think that matters?

263
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,440
No, no, no. Hang on a sec. I never said

264
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
it didn't matter. It's not critical to

265
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
get going.

266
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,760
And somebody who's been through an

267
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
online service,

268
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
okay,

269
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
that's built around subscriptions,

270
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,080
someone who does business with Netflix

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
and knows how they work and other online

272
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
services. Okay,

273
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
that is what's going to get you over the

274
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
top. We can get the door opening to

275
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,240
Fisher Price or any toy company.

276
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,399
Once we have the customers, I mean, my

277
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,160
company secures and services some of the

278
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,320
largest internet sites in the world.

279
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
Once we have the customers, trust me,

280
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
there's no problem going to Mattel.

281
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
These

282
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,279
companies, there's so many guys that

283
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
provide internet logistics services.

284
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,440
There's a whole industry full of guys

285
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,680
like this. Dime a dozen.

286
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,680
I think I know exactly how to build this

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
business and exactly how to exit it,

288
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,519
which matters to you. That's how you

289
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,519
actually make money.

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,000
I like $200,000. Um I I was going to ask

291
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,000
you guys if you'd consider 35% for

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
$200,000.

293
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,440
Are you saying if I match their offer,

294
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,440
he'll do the deal with me?

295
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,880
Done.

296
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,000
How about this? I like what this guy

297
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,920
brings, so I'll split it with him.

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,959
I'll do that.

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,360
We have a deal.

300
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,640
Done.

301
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,519
Wow, you're out, Nicole.

302
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,519
Robert, cut you out. Robert, I'm so

303
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,519
sorry.

304
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm very excited. This is a great idea.

305
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
Thank you so much.

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
I love it. Robert, you were the toy they

307
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,240
were playing with for a little while and

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,240
she sent you back.

309
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,760
New found respect. You broke up with

310
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
your potential partner without even

311
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
looking at him.

312
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
Give me someone that.

313
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,120
You know what happened.

314
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
And you join with the devil.

315
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
You're a savage. You got the steal of a

316
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,519
lifetime.

317
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
Why did she like him? I've never seen

318
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,160
anyone like him.

319
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,240
One of those mysteries of life,

320
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,360
man. What it means for Toy Guru to be in

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,279
business with Kevin and Mark is just uh

322
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,760
it's the perfect connections. I had my

323
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,839
eye on Kevin when I walked in there. Um

324
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm thrilled. I'm so thrilled. It's

325
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,160
going to be great.
