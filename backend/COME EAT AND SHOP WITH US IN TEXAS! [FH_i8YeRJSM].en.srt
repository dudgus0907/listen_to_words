00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,639
Texas today we are going out we are

119
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,720
filming with Sam and Colby and because

120
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,479
we're filming with them we're going to

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,360
leave our camera here so we don't steal

122
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,320
any of their content sorry guys for the

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,320
quick Interruption from the Vlog but

124
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,160
there's a pretty massive time Jump in

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,639
content right now we basically filmed

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,960
the entire day with Sam and kobby and

127
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,840
didn't pick up our Vlog camera once so

128
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,960
this next clip is me waking up Chris the

129
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,199
day technically two days after the day

130
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,440
we got to Texas I believe but the clip

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,120
also just doesn't look like it makes

132
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,400
sense but I personally think it's the

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,960
funniest thing on earth to wake somebody

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,320
up with like an ultimatum right like you

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,960
need to do this instantly because then

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
they're just so confused like I woke up

137
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Chris with a relative sense of urgency

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,919
offering him lemonade in this next clip

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,440
and it's my favorite thing ever cuz it's

140
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,199
like why the would he need lemonade

141
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,840
he was just asleep you know what I mean

142
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,720
he clearly doesn't want Lemonade he was

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,280
sound asleep a second ago

144
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
to the clip

145
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,319

ranking his kids even the way that the

200
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,360
fork goes into the meatball is

201
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,479

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,399
in Texas I'm putting lotion on my face

310
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160

311
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,279
about an hour we're going to eat it one

312
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,760
more place I know we said our one goal

313
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,000
was to go to barbecue restaurant and

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Vlog it and we went to a barbecue

315
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,320
restaurant twice we just didn't Vlog it

316
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,720
either time so this year and this this

317
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,519
year of better content

318
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,000
is us making sure we are ready for what

319
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,000
we're going to film and we went to a

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,399
 Italian place on the Vlog but

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,199
life is unpredictable so whatever we

322
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,639
went to a barbecue place literally once

323
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,880
but it was with Sam and Colby right

324
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,040
before we filmed for their stuff so it's

325
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,560
like obviously we weren't going to like

326
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,519
bust out the camera we were like meeting

327
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,920

353
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,399
mean my whole goal was to for them to

354
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,279
have a good enough experience that they

355
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,079
want to bring us to something they do in

356
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,759
the future so I hope we get an invite
