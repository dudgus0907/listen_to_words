1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
The idea for your future ready mine

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,680
really started when I observed many many

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,160
people in this world to not being able

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
to deal with that uncertainty that the

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
future actually holds right and that

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,120
created a lot of anxiety for people

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,840
around the future. One of the

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
experiences I had a couple of years ago

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,400
really helped me to understand that we

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,240
have more control of our future than we

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,880
actually think was when the wildfires

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,519
happened in California. They came clo as

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
close as 1 mile to our house. So what we

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
noticed is that police came and gave us

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,320
an evacuation order, right? So we had to

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,559
pack our things in less than 10 minutes

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,879
and evacuate our house. Our family of

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,879
five. What I told my kids and what I

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,920
told myself is that we cannot control

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,399
the fires. So our house might be gone or

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,160
it might be still there when we return.

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
But what we can control is how we

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,160
respond to that situation. Do we respond

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,120
with optimism? Do we respond with

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,079
openness, with curiosity? All of that

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,800
really helped us to then start living a

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,559
life that was very different before the

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,960
wildfires, a life that is more aligned

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,200
with nature, where we grow our own food,

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,600
where we respect nature even more. We

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,000
were quite optimistic when we left our

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
house and uh after 14 days we were able

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,799
to return back and luckily the house was

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,560
still there and our op optimism about

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,479
how to live with the future was also

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,799
actually increased. So what I wanted to

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,680
give people is three things. First one

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
is a framework that they can use to

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
really build the future that they want

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,960
to see happening. The second thing is I

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
wanted to give them stories from

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,159
individuals that build remarkable

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
futures for themselves. And the third

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,240
thing is really practices that everybody

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,079
can use in their own lives to create the

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,439
dream future they want to see

47
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,680
happening. Hello, my name is Frederick

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,520
Fat and I'm the first and former chief

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
innovation evangelist at Google. I'm

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
also the author of a book, What's Next

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
is Now? How to live future ready.

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,880
Everybody is interested in their future.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
What we mostly see is that people think

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,880
about the future as something abstract,

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
right? But I believe that predictions

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
don't really help when we think about

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,879
the future. So I want to help people to

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,520
have a clearer picture about the future

59
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,840
by actually imagining it and not just

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
imagining the future, but imagining

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
their future. Because the future is not

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
something that just happens to you. It's

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
something that you make happen. And for

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,200
most people, it's really coming down to

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
that question. How can I create a better

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,400
future for myself? And I want to give

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,310
people the mind state to really shape

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,519
the future they want to see

69
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:40,879
[Music]

70
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,560
happening. I've been the chief

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,040
innovation evangelist at Google for

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,280
about 12 and a half years. My role I was

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,680
really responsible on shaping the

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,680
culture of creativity and innovation at

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,519
Google. Really trying to train people in

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,800
things like curiosity and empathy and

77
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,000
experimentation. Giving them the right

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,920
methods and tools and also mind state to

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
really invent a better future. And

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,360
secondly, shaping the culture, trying to

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,159
create initiatives in the culture that

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,680
really brings the values to life that

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,519
Google stands for. Values around

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,319
creativity, having an ambition around

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,640
the future, but also trying to think 10x

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,640
and trying to think really bold and big

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,800
about the future. That was really um

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
part of of the work. And uh when you

89
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,720
want to create a culture, right, what I

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,720
really see is that most cultures in

91
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,440
organizations have specific values.

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,280
Values like creativity or productivity

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,920
or community. What I try to do is

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,879
activate those values through rituals.

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,200
One of the rituals that I included in

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,360
our culture at Google was what I call

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,760
the Penguin Award because the Penguin

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
Award really rewarded people for taking

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,400
risks. And uh when you take risks,

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
you're really trying to try many things

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,879
out, right? You're thinking not just

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
bold, but you're acting bold as well.

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
Encouraging risk-taking through a ritual

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,040
with the penguin award was something

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,239
fascinating because for me, penguins

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,040
really stand for taking risks. As you

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,440
imagine, penguins on an ice shelf, many

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,280
of them, right, a colony of penguins,

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
there's always one penguin that's the

110
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,199
courageous penguin that jumps first into

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
the water. the rest of the colony stands

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,360
back and really observes is that if that

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
little penguin comes back up with food

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
or became food, right, there's a 50%

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,960
chance. And so what I wanted to signal

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
is that when people really jump into the

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,840
cold water, meaning that they're trying

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
something new, that they're

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
experimenting, that they're taking a

120
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,080
risk, that should be rewarded with the

121
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,720
penguin award. Because we also know that

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,960
when no one jumps from that ice shelf,

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,199
no one takes a risk in an organization.

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,040
colony of penguins will disappear and so

125
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,199
will the organization. So I think it's

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
really important that we build cultures

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
through rituals in uh every

128
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,759
organization. I think everybody's able

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,440
to do

130
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,360
that. Yes, I think everybody can be that

131
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,440
courageous penguin, right? That jumps

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
first into the water in that metaphor.

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
Courage is something that we all have,

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,960
right? But usually our mind doesn't like

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,960
to take risks. I think what we can do is

136
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,440
instead of waiting for the perfect

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,000
moment or for perfection, just go for

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,320
it. Just give it a try, right? And see

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
what happens. And usually what we find

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,479
is when you take that risk, when you're

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,800
open to trying something new, you feel

142
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,039
rewarded, right? That creates a very

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,199
comforting effect as well. So what I'm

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,919
practicing myself is trying to not do

145
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,320
things twice, right? not to fall into

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,479
that autopilot that our mind loves to go

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
onto because that autopilot really

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,440
creates or saves energy for our mind,

149
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
right? And when as soon as we get off

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,199
autopilot and we engage in something

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,600
new, we take a risk or we try something

152
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,000
new. It might be talking to a stranger

153
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
or it might be trying out a new idea,

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,440
our minds need to be activated. That

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,440
energy, I think, is great because then

156
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
we see that we're getting off autopilot

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
and we actually we're trying something

158
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,000
new. and then that might lead to an

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,520
innovation then as

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,440
well. During my time at Google, I've

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,280
been able to work with tens of thousands

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,080
of Googlers and really trying to figure

163
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,319
out how do people not just imagine a

164
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
better future, how do they innovate, how

165
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,919
do they use their creativity to really

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
create something better. So in my first

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,400
couple of weeks I actually traveled to

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,720
really many offices connected with many

169
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,720
many Googlers around the world to really

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
trying to understand how do people

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,360
innovate and what I found is that it's

172
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,039
usually not a place that makes the

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,120
difference. It's also not a specific

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
framework and it's also not the

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,600
resources they have access to. What I

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,520
found is really in their mind state what

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
I call a future ready mind state. And

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,160
that mind state for me has five

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,240
dimensions. First, it's about radical

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
optimism. Thinking not just that the

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
glass is half full, but seeing the

182
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,639
potential to fill the glass even

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,360
further. It's about unreserved openness.

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,440
Being open to many ideas, being open to

185
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
perspectives, and also being open to

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,599
change your own perspective as well is

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,919
really critical because openness is

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,199
really supercharger to your personal

189
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,120
growth. The third one is about

190
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,280
curiosity, compulsive curiosity, asking

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,599
those big what if questions that allow

192
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,800
you to really think big. And then it's

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,400
about experimentation, perpetual

194
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,720
experimentation, these tiny quick

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,319
experiments that allow you to really

196
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
learning quickly, to really learn

197
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,319
quickly as well because the path to the

198
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,319
future is really paved with experiments.

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,080
And then it's about empathy. Not just

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,319
empathy for other people, but also

201
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,319
empathy for your future self. trying to

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,160
understand your future needs is really

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
critical. And then the last dimension is

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
dimension X. It's your personal

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,599
superpower that allows you to really use

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,919
whatever your superpower is to create

207
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,759
these uh incredible innovations, to

208
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,080
create something new, and to tap into

209
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,400
your creativity as well. So these six

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,479
dimensions for me really define what I

211
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,720
call a future ready mind. And with a

212
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,639
future ready mind, you can really see

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,240
more opportunities. you can take control

214
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,199
of your future and you can shape the

215
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,639
future that you want to see

216
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,720
happening. I think it's the combination

217
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
of those dimensions, right? It's not

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
that radical optimism is more important

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
that openness or empathy, right? I think

220
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,680
they're all incredibly important. And

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,759
the good news is that we all have a

222
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,400
certain amount of those qualities of

223
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,240
those dimensions in ourselves. We all to

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,640
a certain degree open. We all to a

225
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,719
certain degree optimistic. We all like

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,800
to experiment from time to time. But

227
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,279
what I also see is that when we take for

228
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,279
example curiosity, our curiosity when we

229
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,519
grow up actually goes dormant. That's

230
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,360
what studies actually show. So I want to

231
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,680
bring those dimensions back into your

232
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,360
life by actually trying to train

233
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,680
yourself in curiosity, in openness, in

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,839
experimentation, and in optimism. And if

235
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,200
you train yourself in these things, I

236
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
guarantee you're going to see more

237
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
opportunities for yourself and you're

238
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,800
going to take control of the future that

239
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
you want to actually see happening. So

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,080
I've been able to work with many

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,480
organizations range from the UN to NASA

242
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,200
to the NBA to the German Soccer

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,680
Association and many many more including

244
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,720
startups. And what I've seen is that

245
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,519
let's take curiosity. Startups really

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,519
use their curiosity to explore something

247
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,800
new. They're the best in asking good

248
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,959
questions and trying to really reimagine

249
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,440
what is possible. When organizations

250
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,680
grow older, right, what we see is that

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,640
curiosity is usually replaced with

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,120
scaling or other things that they want

253
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,200
to focus on. So two things I've tried

254
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,000
when it comes to training people

255
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,240
innovation and creativity was first to

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,160
help them to train specific things like

257
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,399
empathy, expansive thinking or

258
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,519
experimentation. And the second thing is

259
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,160
what we tried is we built environments

260
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,040
where people really could reduce that

261
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,200
friction from having an idea to building

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,519
your first prototype. And the garage

263
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
that I founded was one of those places

264
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,760
where a lot of Googlers came together to

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,839
try out some ideas, right? To really

266
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
start to push the boundaries on some of

267
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
those ideas and really started to learn

268
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
quickly how things work and what works

269
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,440
and what doesn't work. So it's really a

270
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
space around experimentation. We had um

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
projects like project lon was created

272
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
those stratospheric balloons to really

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,760
provide uh internet around the world.

274
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,920
Antennas and some of the the balloon

275
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
parts were actually um prototyped in the

276
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
garage and experimented with. What I

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,000
found is that also Google Glass for

278
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,279
example was launched out of the garage.

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,839
A project where we invited people to

280
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,519
test out this service uh a couple of

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,040
years ago and prototype it and

282
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,040
experiment with it. Right? So I think

283
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
for me it was really critical that we

284
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
take an approach to innovation that is

285
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,959
based on experimentation and empathy and

286
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,040
expansive thinking. Those three elements

287
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,360
that really allow you to not just

288
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,240
imagine ideas but really build ideas

289
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,040
that are meaningful to people that are

290
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
based on radical new ideas but also that

291
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,079
are tried out so that we can start

292
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,000
learning what works and what doesn't

293
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,160
work. Innovation doesn't happen by

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,040
itself, right? It's something where you

295
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,560
have to train people in but also you

296
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
have to create a culture and an

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
environment where innovation can

298
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,240
actually happen. Those two elements are

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
very critical, right? Trying to provide

300
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,240
the right training for people so that

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,480
they can literally train their mind on

302
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,800
how to innovate around how to imagine

303
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,040
and how to think expansively and so

304
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,200
forth. And at the same time finding a

305
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,200
culture where this is actually possible

306
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,360
with initiatives like the penguin award

307
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,000
that I just shared um as well that

308
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,240
allows people to take more risks. So

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,200
combining those two things where you

310
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,640
train people into in uh in innovation

311
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
and you build a culture around

312
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,040
innovation is really critical and that

313
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,680
was the main focus of my work. What I

314
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,560
felt is that when it comes to the future

315
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,959
for example and innovation sometimes see

316
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,040
that our mind creates four strategies

317
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,200
that really is not really helpful but

318
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,800
it's just um a natural very human thing

319
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
that evolves when we think about the

320
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,639
future. The first thing is that we have

321
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,040
anxiety about the future, right?

322
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,279
Sometimes we think about the future as

323
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,519
not desirable, as something that just

324
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,839
happens to us, right? That is not in our

325
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,079
control and that creates anxiety, right?

326
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,240
The second thing is that sometimes we

327
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,399
think we can just wait until the future

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,120
happens, right? So we wait until

329
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,000
something in our lives happens and then

330
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,920
we start to act. The third thing is that

331
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
sometimes we think the future is owned

332
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,160
by others, right? So we think that our

333
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,839
partners, our managers or our leaders or

334
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,399
the government or politicians or

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
whatever it is are owning the future and

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,519
creating the future. And I think that's

337
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,760
not true. And the fourth one is that

338
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
sometimes we just want to deny the

339
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,279
future, right? We want to bring back the

340
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,200
past. We want to say like, oh, you know,

341
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,959
past times have been better and and all

342
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,440
of those arguments. So having that

343
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,600
anxiety, waiting for the future,

344
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,079
thinking that others own the future and

345
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,639
denying the future are four things that

346
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,880
really are not helpful, right? Because I

347
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,120
think everybody has the opportunity to

348
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,760
shape their own future and have control

349
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
over their own

350
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,920
future. I think there's there's three

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,959
things that I want to share. First one

352
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,360
is trying to really imagine your future

353
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,200
and make that a practice every day.

354
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
Maybe the first 60 seconds in the

355
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,600
morning or the first three minutes in

356
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,079
the morning trying to really just close

357
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,880
your eyes for a moment and trying to

358
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,120
imagine your future self. Trying to see

359
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,279
a clearer picture of where you going to

360
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
be in the future, a year from now for

361
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,200
example, who you going to be surrounded

362
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
by and what are you doing? And then the

363
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,120
fourth critical element is how do you

364
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
feel in that future and what do you want

365
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,680
to feel in this future as well? very

366
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,839
important practice that everybody can do

367
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,839
every morning or throughout the day to

368
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,680
really build that muscle of imagination,

369
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,480
your future self. The second thing I

370
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,959
recommend doing is you want to turn into

371
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,279
a more optimistic person. There are some

372
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,279
interesting studies that show that if

373
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,959
you write down three things in the

374
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,600
evening and that can be on your phone or

375
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,680
it can be on a piece of paper that

376
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,440
really brings up the three things that

377
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,240
you're grateful for throughout the day

378
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,160
that you think that went well that are

379
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,079
the positives in your day, right? And

380
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,320
that could be small things. Note down

381
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,560
three things every day. After 21 days,

382
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,720
your mind actually changes and looks for

383
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,399
the more positive things in in your life

384
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,600
as well. And I think that's a very easy

385
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,600
practice that everybody can do.
