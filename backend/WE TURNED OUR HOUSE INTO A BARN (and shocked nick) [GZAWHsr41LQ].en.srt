1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,079
we got another

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:18,880
[Music]

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,880
Banger I can't wait for Nick to walk

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,039
in look I'm never leaving the house

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,800
again so about a month ago we surprised

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,960
Nick with a mariachi band when he came

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,960
home from Tokyo Japan Australia

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,640
yes and you guys really love that video

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,600
really shocked Nick so me and Chris

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,440
thought what better thing to do than

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,960
that again except not a mariachi band I

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,960
think it's like a good thing if we just

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,520
keep Nick on his toes when he comes I

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
completely agree all right so here's the

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
plan Nick had a space camp meeting to

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,399
plan content for his new shirt which

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,640
gave me and Matt about a 2-hour window

18
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,359
to transform our living room into a barn

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,840
Nick woke up early and got a ride from

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,800
our manager to let Matt sleep in but in

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
reality we woke up right when he left

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,280

you I think the Ducks will love it h you

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,879
probably should put it more to the right

79
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,959
cuz it's not fully in between those two

80
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,560
where's our Hammer I don't know that'd

81
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,560
be so funny though I really hope like

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,640
the second he walks in like a rooster

83
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,680
just like yeah he opens the front door

84
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,959
he's like up this going up the stairs

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,000
and he look he he's like why is the cage

86
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,040
in the kitchen and then it he turn the

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,120
this is going to be great obviously this

88
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,120
takes up way more room than the mariachi

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,519
band so he's probably going to catch on

90
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,360
earlier than like it doesn't matter it's

91
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,480
going to take him way longer to register

92
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,560
