perfect amount oh yeah it was supposed

126
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,160
to make 22 cupcakes there's 24 holes

127
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,800
here we have distributed the cupcake mix

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,160
evenly into two trays not really cuz

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,759
this tray is looking quite empty and the

130
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,039
oven is preheated so we're going to put

131
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,479
these into the oven and then we're going

132
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,720
to be right back for the decorating

133
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,680

this between me and you right now oh my

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,840
are we decorating the cupcakes with full

138
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,440
vision or are we blinding ourselves to

139
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,720
see you can make the best cupcake let's

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,440
ask the viewer I might decorate it on a

141
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:51,280
unicycle really yeah I say we bring in a

142
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,440
tribe of lions a pride of lions good and

143
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280

144
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,840
we decorate the cupcakes that's a good

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,479

Invisalign the reason we love our

201
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
invisaline aligners is that we can

202
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,479
easily incorporate in our daily life and

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,199
eat whatever we want like these cupcakes

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,759
the go we're always filming videos and

207
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,240
incorporating invisaline into our daily

208
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,919
schedule has been the easiest thing for

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,120
us we're able to eat whatever we want

210
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,360

216
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,440
you believe how similar our cupcakes are

217
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,839
due to the fact that we both use vanilla

218
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,360
frosting and uh sprinkles mine's better

219
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,360
