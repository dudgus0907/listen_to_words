1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Right. That doesn't sound like an AI

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,440
recommendation, but because they told us

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,360
they all the pitches talked something

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
about AI. To be honest, like many of

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,639
these these are more of like a buzz

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,519
word. They are using it more like a buzz

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,000
word. Hi, I'm John Willie. Uh I'm a

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,920
three-time founder. I graduated from MIT

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and from Stanford. I I won the best

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
thesis award at Stanford. Had multiple

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,720
exits so far. also started Inception

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,599
Studio which is now the top accelerator

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,439
program for early stage AI founders here

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
in Silicon Valley. You know I've I've

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
been an engineer since I was 5 years old

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
when I start started programming. I won

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
the USA computer olympiad as one of the

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
top 15 programmers in the US. As an

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
investor I'm looking for venture scale

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,840
opportunities where I can put in a

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
million dollars and then I have an

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
opportunity for at least 100x return you

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,280
know coming back to me within you know 5

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,120
to 7 to 10 years. Pitch.te Tech is where

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
bold startups on tech domains get

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,440
game-changing insights from top VCs.te

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
domain instantly signals you're all

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
about cutting edge tech and innovation.

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,160
Building a tech startup build it on

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,160
tech.

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,880
So we are raising around our preed round

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,200
of 1.5 million. The goal of today is to

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,080
meet investors and potentially close our

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,159
round. Let's go. My name is Laurana. Uh

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm a co-founder and the CEO of Rexalto.

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
We have developed and introduced an AI

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
dynamic pricing engine. We previously

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
co-ounded one of the largest European

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,000
car sharing companies. Company generated

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,520
75 million uh annual revenue and what's

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
more important it was cash flow

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,680
positive. What's happening now in the

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
car rental industry? Increasing prices

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
of uh vehicles, uncertain residual

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
values, and growing percentage of

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,720
electric vehicles are forcing car rental

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,880
and mobility companies to put more focus

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,880
on not just reselling cars as they used

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,159
to do before, but actually making sure

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,079
that they do money on their

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
cooperations. On top of that, for

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
mobility companies especially, they

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,479
strive to increase their utilization to

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,240
improve uh fleet distribution and all of

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
that can be done with the correct

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
pricing. Taking all of that into

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,560
account, we have engineered an AI

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,720
dynamic pricing engine that basically

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
sets the right price at any given time.

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
First class of economics, bringing

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,599
supply and demand into equilibrium. So

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,599
the way it works is we look into the

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,400
company's historical data, market

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,879
historical data, competitors prices, and

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,720
many other factors that help us forecast

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,959
demand. Things like weather forecast,

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,959
flight information, booking information.

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,680
We not only set the price for the for

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,200
our customers but we also push it back

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
either into their fleet management

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,599
system or to the OTAAS the aggregators

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,480
where they get rents from. We currently

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,080
focus on the North American, Europe and

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
the Middle East. The segments that we

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,640
look at and work with are either small

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
companies or large enterprise companies.

77
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,680
What differentiates us is that we uh

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
work not only with car rental industry

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
but with mobility industry and of the

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,560
technology because for mobility

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,040
companies we use up to 500 data points

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,680
for car rental companies it's about 20

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,680
30 maybe 40. We offer three pricing as a

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,640
service for our traction. We currently

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,319
have uh 20 customers paying customers

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,519
plus piloting customers. We have

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,120
integrated six uh reseller solution. We

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,680
uh generated about 200,000 uh annual

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,120
revenue. Uh this year we are raising a

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,720
round of 1.5 million. We closed 950.

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,120
We're now closing the remaining 550.

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,879
Thank you very much. You mentioned kind

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
of in the presentation. Okay. Like you

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,040
have uh some of your customers are using

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,720
this for kind of rental car rental car

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,000
rates. Are there other kind of things in

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,799
the automotive space that you're using

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,120
for that dynamic pricing today or is it

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,440
a lot of companies in mobility are using

100
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
that. Look at Uber, Lift, other mobility

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
companies. It depends because you have a

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
lot of smaller players players for

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,280
micromobility for instance and they use

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
third party solution. They don't have

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,040
their proprietary software and this is

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
for us they are resellers because we

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
integrate into their platform and they

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,959
sell us to their uh to their customers.

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,560
you know, for any tech enabled platform.

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,080
I mean, I imagine like they're already

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
doing something like this or they're

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
doing some version of this where they

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
have they're going to have some pricing

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,799
engine. They're going to be able to like

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
determine prices like this is kind of a

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,919
common thing. I mean, you mentioned Uber

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,000
and Lift, they obviously do all of that,

118
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,160
but then now I mean everything from

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
concert tickets to, you know, things

120
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,560
anything e-commerce kind of often doing

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
this type of this type of dynamic

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
pricing, this might be like core to

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
their business, very important. So, like

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
they may want to like develop that

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
themselves. they have all the data about

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
it like what type of customer would use

127
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
like a service like yours uh versus like

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
hey we're going to de we either develop

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,639
this in our own inhouse or like use some

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
other very good good question first I'll

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,800
answer who are the companies that

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,040
develop their own like I talked to head

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,080
of revenue management of get get around

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,720
they spent a lot of money and many years

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,040
developing the dynamic pricing and it

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,960
didn't work it's not that simple right

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,560
because you need to know how to do it

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,919
not to reduce your re revenue even by 1%

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
right because if you do that you're

140
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,320
fired. So they said we cannot just use

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
your service software because we need to

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,639
make sure our work so we'll keep on

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
advancing our technology and use it at

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,240
the end of the day. Who answering your

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,880
question who are our customers? We have

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,320
either very small companies that have 50

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,280
hundred of cars. They don't have their

148
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,720
proprietary basically their fleet

149
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,160
managers right they're operating their

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
fleet and they want to do it in the most

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,720
effective way. they have a third-party

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,520
software solution and they compete with

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
a budget enterprise etc. So they need to

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
make sure that they somehow stand out.

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
So these are our customers and they use

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,600
our standard dashboard self-service

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,160
dashboard. Then we work with large

158
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,320
companies and these companies are not as

159
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
big as enterprise herds but they have

160
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,639
hundreds of thousands of cars still

161
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
huge. They basically manage their

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,320
franchises. So they need to make sure

163
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,639
that their pricing is consistent

164
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,800
throughout their uh network that they

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,280
offer the same quality of service and

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
that they actually their franchises do

167
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,520
well because they get a percentage of

168
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,080
the what franchises earn. So that's our

169
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,479
second type of customers big groups and

170
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
enterprise companies that manage

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,120
franchises. What what makes your dynamic

172
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,280
pricing engine better than the

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,160
competition? First, as I said, like it's

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,800
it's the number of uh data points that

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
our engine can absorb and make this

176
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
decision and judgment. You saw that we

177
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,880
have an AI in the beginning of of this.

178
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
Every company

179
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,280
now flexing internet. Yeah. But I'll

180
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,919
tell you where the AI comes. Uh so it's

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,759
it's it's it's a bunch of ML models that

182
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
work together, right? So that's not

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,360
there's this is this is not AI but where

184
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,360
the AI comes is that we every time our

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,240
model works in a certain location for a

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,400
certain customer it learns from its past

187
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
uh performance and next time makes

188
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
better predictions make better

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,759
assumptions and improves the quality. I

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
mean, and and on that topic, I noticed

191
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
your pricing model is that you're

192
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
charging like per car, you know? I mean,

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,120
and if if you actually are really

194
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,560
confident about, hey, we're gonna have

195
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,400
this R this is the ROI that we're going

196
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
to get. Like, why are you not like

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
saying, hey, well, you get you're going

198
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,280
to have 90% of the up and we'll just

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
take 10% of the of the one customer with

200
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,560
who did that. And that was the I was

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,960
like telling my team like, let's move

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
into that like we will make sure our

203
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,720
customers do better and we'll do better.

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
It didn't work. uh we we still have one

205
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
customer on that contract and I'm just

206
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,400
waiting for the contract to renew to get

207
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,759
get away from the the reason why you

208
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,599
always have to you need to have a

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,160
baseline. So what are you comparing to?

210
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
So usually you would oranges to oranges

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
December to December, January to

212
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,240
January. But then when things like

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Easter or Ramadan happens, they move

214
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
from one month to another. Then they

215
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
like yeah but the increase was not

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
because of your pricing model but

217
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
because it was uh Easter was in this

218
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
month and last year it was in a

219
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,560
different month. So much time is spent

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,840
on actually this argument because they

221
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,599
don't want to pay you more, they want to

222
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,840
pay you less. And we said like at this

223
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,960
point we cannot do this. It's it's it's

224
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,199
crazy. So we said we want to be uh clear

225
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,759
and straightforward. We'll do uh

226
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,680
standard pricing per car per month and

227
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,080
that's that's good enough. Yeah. I mean

228
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,280
but that that also I mean you point to

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,360
like kind of fundamental problem which

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
is like that is like measuring like the

231
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
the improvement in lift that you're

232
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
going to have like from this because

233
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
Yeah. I mean, how do you compare apple

234
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
to apples like when you're kind of

235
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,680
revenue over time? still compare. We

236
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
still they have dashboards. They see how

237
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,240
their pricing increase over a longer

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,000
period of time. Like okay, maybe one

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,640
month to another might be tricky. But

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
then if you look on a year scale, you

241
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,560
still see the increase. Do your

242
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,519
customers do AB testing. They can run

243
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,080
two side by side. We usually start with

244
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,920
AB testing especially with big uh

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
customers but we don't do it within one

246
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
city because you can't you cannot do it

247
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
in with one location. The customer will

248
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
choose what is cheaper. So you have to

249
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,480
do it different locations. So we would

250
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,440
choose few selected location usually the

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
way our pilot works two three locations

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
one would be maybe the top location

253
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
another one would be midsize location

254
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,120
and third would be like the small

255
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,519
location and then we will see the

256
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,680
results in those those and what has been

257
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,080
the result worst result that we had was

258
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
plus 5% of revenue increase. Our best

259
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,440
was it was six times but that was a very

260
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,000
particular case a luxury uh car rental

261
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
company that was staying within within

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,519
its boundaries. We analyze also the

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,279
supply and we said it's Dubai end of

264
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,200
December there are two Lamborghinis

265
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,440
available and there is a demand for 100

266
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,720
you can put whatever price you want you

267
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
will still sell it right that doesn't

268
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,320
sound like an AI recommendation no that

269
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,760
I mean like that because they was cap

270
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
they called us because they called me

271
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,160
they were like a brilliant your system

272
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
is crazy that tells me to put I don't

273
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
remember the price something is wrong

274
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,279
with that I was like hold on let me uh

275
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,880
look into this so I looked into this and

276
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,200
then we said like that's what you should

277
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
put customers don't like dynamic pricing

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,360
because it's like wait a second. Oh, you

279
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,920
got you got a different price than I got

280
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,560
when I like when I went you know went to

281
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,640
for this or like it's you know there's a

282
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,720
lot of backlash around pricing and like

283
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
these these sorts of things which

284
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
ultimately ends up kind of a brand risk

285
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,560
there which is like why sometimes like

286
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
even though they can you know they could

287
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
potentially uh you know try to do this

288
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
like kind of they're they're careful

289
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,399
about time to do this. So what what are

290
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
your thoughts on that side? First of

291
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,000
all, uh revenue is not the only KPI why

292
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,800
our customers use us. In many cases is

293
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,959
they want to avoid human mistake. Many

294
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,640
most of them they do uh they look at

295
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,160
competitors prices and they do their

296
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
manual and I mean the level of

297
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,440
complexity you have different codes zip

298
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
codes like cars are divided into codes.

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,079
You have different lengths of rental one

300
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
day, two days, three days etc etc. You

301
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,120
have different locations. So actually

302
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,360
the number of price points you have to

303
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
change every day sometimes even every

304
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,000
hour it's tremendous. So if you do it

305
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
all manually you do mistakes and this

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
this is what our top managers of the

307
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,120
companies tell us. We know that this is

308
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
not

309
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,519
ideal or we often have to actually cut

310
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,279
cut cut the road. So like okay we'll

311
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,959
like not put too much effort here

312
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,959
because just too much. So we'll make an

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,519
assumption. So without basing their

314
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,000
assumptions on data. So automatization

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,040
of the process and pushing it back into

316
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,680
the system is number one KPI for many of

317
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
our large companies. Secondly, we don't

318
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
change the price depending on the

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
customer. So this is up to the company

320
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
whether they want to charge C different

321
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,880
customers have their loyalty programs

322
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,800
for mobility companies. We do we don't

323
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,959
look at a particular customer because we

324
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,560
don't have the data but we cluster them.

325
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,160
So we understand that this customer

326
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
falls into this cluster at this and so

327
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,920
there's a different coefficient but

328
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
that's what all mobility companies are

329
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,720
famous for because they uh they give the

330
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
car to to different audiences. This is

331
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
very interesting because I mean I went

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
to your website actually to very nice

333
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
looking website uh to be honest looking

334
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,839
at your website I had no clue what you

335
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,760
guys did. Uh, so like this is uh like uh

336
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,760
hearing the pitch is like actually like

337
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,920
now I have a much better idea of like uh

338
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
what what you're doing because like I

339
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
think it just at least in terms of like

340
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
the copy that was on the website they

341
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,720
didn't it didn't come across like on on

342
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,839
there. You you cover the team extremely

343
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,600
early. Um which to be honest like before

344
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
I know what problem you're solving it's

345
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,360
hard to be able to judge wait is this

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
the right team that sort of thing right?

347
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
Um, so like you know sometimes better

348
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
like say that later like after oh and by

349
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
the way this is why the this is here's

350
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,240
the evidence is why we're the right team

351
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,200
to do this right and so like what is

352
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,639
your connection to this problem this

353
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,800
space and like how about the rest of the

354
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,040
team like how like why are you uniquely

355
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,480
suited to be like you're the ones in the

356
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,920
world to solve this problem. So that

357
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,519
yeah the actually the reason why I

358
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,839
showed it in the beginning is that in

359
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,920
our past company when we exited and

360
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
decided to do something else together we

361
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
started thinking okay let's share our

362
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
knowledge with other companies we

363
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,160
definitely decided not to build another

364
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
car a car car sharing company anywhere

365
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,920
in the world it's very operationally

366
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,839
intense business and then we thought

367
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,680
maybe we do consultancy maybe we do that

368
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,480
that that we said listen let's do what

369
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,440
we did best and we really were best on

370
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,040
the market in terms of pricing correctly

371
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,600
distributing the fleet pricing

372
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,360
uh being considered to be the low coster

373
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,519
and yet making more revenue than our

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
customers competitors. So that's what we

375
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,600
did and we said let's try to replicate

376
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
it uh for other companies. So we started

377
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,760
initially with car car sharing and

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,320
mobility companies but then we said

379
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,800
listen there's a much bigger market here

380
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,399
car rental which has it's a dinosaur

381
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,880
industry. So we started looking into

382
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,040
that talking to potential customers and

383
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,839
that's how it all started. Thank you.

384
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,760
Thank you very much. I grew up in a very

385
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,480
international environment. I'm half

386
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,639
Russian, half Indian. So I was always

387
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,519
exposed to different cultures. I

388
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,160
graduated from two US universities, both

389
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,639
in Russia. Then I traveled abroad. So I

390
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,920
started my previous uh together with my

391
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,519
co-founders. We started the previous

392
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,320
company back in 2014 and we were running

393
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,680
the business for 8 years. I left the

394
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,839
country in 2022 for for the war reasons

395
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,160
and it was one of the most difficult

396
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,959
moments of my life was very stressful

397
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,639
was very uncertain and we came here to

398
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,440
US together with my family with my

399
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,440
husband after maybe half a year I said I

400
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,560
want to build something new together

401
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,399
something new here we wanted to use our

402
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
knowledge that we gained in our previous

403
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,079
company and the experience that we had

404
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,959
and the understanding of the market and

405
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,959
share it with other companies not only

406
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,440
cautious sharing companies but mobility

407
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,399
companies and also car rental companies.

408
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,920
The thing I like about Rick Alto is is

409
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,839
that uh she is a successful founder that

410
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,720
she built a very successful business

411
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,199
before and based on that experience has

412
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
come up to solve this problem in a

413
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,440
compelling manner. What would been great

414
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,079
for me that I would like is uh uh fairly

415
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720
early on that once she explains that

416
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,959
this is her product is to have a slide

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,639
that first says I have six customers

418
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,279
right now because in the beginning I'm

419
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,360
wondering is this an idea? Does she have

420
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
customers? Does it work? All these

421
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,519
things. But if I know she's got like six

422
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,560
customers that like it then I know this

423
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,920
is great. And then the next is uh in the

424
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,399
same slide is to show in one year I'll

425
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,560
have 20 customers and these are the

426
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,040
customers that I'm working on. And then

427
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,839
maybe 5 years from now this is what I

428
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,920
want 1,000 customers. All the pitches

429
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,760
talked something about AI. To be honest

430
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,360
like many of these are these are more of

431
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,040
like a buzz word. They using it more

432
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,160
like a buzz word. I know we need to talk

433
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,959
about AI so let's like try to craft an

434
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,360
AI story like on onto our business.

435
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,760
didn't really talk about why is a why

436
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
using AI, why is this important, why we

437
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,639
have a tech domain. I think the domain

438
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
that you choose it should reflect what

439
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,880
you're doing, right? I like the idea of

440
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,759
highlighting that it's a tech company,

441
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,480
it's a tech product. And I think it also

442
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,120
we stand out uh to our competitors

443
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,390
because it we highlight uh highlight

444
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:07,750
this point.
