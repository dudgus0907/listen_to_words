Great trip. Let's address the rumors.

22

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
That mat looks bad in pink and red

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
stripes. There are no rumors. I just

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,920
wanted to see if you'd say something

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,000
like off the top of your head and I did.

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840

burp when there's a camera on and that

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
true. It's cuz I just drank this drink.

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,880
greetings, Earthlings. It is Nick. I

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
actually just I am filming on a

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,520
microphone. Hey guys, what is up, guys?

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,400
Welcome back to our [ __ ] channel. Me,

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,159
Matt, and Nick found our old old podcast

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,520
equipment from like 2 years ago and we

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
were going to start a podcast in my

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,000
bedroom in Boston and we decided, oh my

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
god, let's see if that works. And by

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
doing so, we bought a picnic basket and

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
some picnic [ __ ] Picnic We're not start

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
We're not starting a podcast. We just

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
thought it was funny and we saw the

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,799
equipment and we were like, "Fuck it.

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
We're just We have a [ __ ] picnic

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,880
podcast." Yeah. This is what we wanted

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,640
to do like 2 years ago and we were like,

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,080
"What the hell?" We found this [ __ ] all

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
in our garage and we were like, "Why the

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,680
[ __ ] not?" So, now we just have a picnic

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
basket and some food and some questions

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,560
and we're going to do that today and

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
it's honestly going to be really fun.

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
So, basically, Matt went and bought a

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
bunch of mystery items and filled up

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
this picnic basket. Oh my god. Hold on.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,440
Oh my god. And then Nick filled up this

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,200
little ceramic cup thing with like

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
random questions. It's a vase that me

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,040
and Matt don't vase. That looks like a

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,720
ginormous mug. Yeah, this is just

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
missing a handle. Yeah, that looks like

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
a huge mug. I really like it. Matt, tell

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,200
Nick what you just told me in the

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,200
parking lot. No.

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Okay, I'm fine with What are we doing?

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,599
Question boy and picnic basket. Also, I

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
bought this picnic basket for this

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
video, but it's like really cute. Oh, I

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
love it. It looks I like that it has

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
like little underwear on it. I just

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
can't believe we're not sitting. I feel

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
like if I open it, I'm kind of like

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,080
taking its panties off type [ __ ] Don't

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,599
say [ __ ] That's a really freaky and

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,319
weird thing to say. That's like really

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,120
weird. It's like a little lacy set for

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,840

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,079
not. Open it, Chris. Guys, I have only

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
had water for all of 2024. Should I

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
break that sweet? Yes, 100%. Stop being

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,720
a baby and drink something other than

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,880
water. No, Matt, don't do this.

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Oh, I can't watch it. I can't watch it.

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
I can't watch it. I can't watch it. I

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,520
can't watch it. I can't watch it. I

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
can't watch it. I can't watch it. I

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
can't watch it. I just think of his

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,280
tooth flying out of his mouth. I can't

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,120
watch it. Kid almost cut my finger off

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,840
when he went to grab that. Oh my god. He

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,680
almost cut my finger off. Woo! Turn me

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,600
into a

131
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,160
dog. Let me do this, please. Can Can I

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
do it, Nick? I'm chipping away. I'll

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,880
stab you in the I'll stab you in the

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,960
neck. Give it to me, Matt. In the neck.

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,880
There's nothing I hate more than

136
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,199
something that just happened to me. And

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,919
when Matt took the lid off of this, he

138
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
threw it at my head and it lightly

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,800
grazed the back of my head and flew

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,440
behind me. And I've said this countless

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,639
times before. My least favorite thing on

142
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,080
the face of the earth

143
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,600
stop is being lightly grazed. I [ __ ]

144
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
hate it more than anything. If something

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
were to like slightly touch my hand,

146
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,160
slightly touch my arm, I want to

147
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,080
destroy. What about your ball sack? Like

148
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,880
when it rubs up against my back, like a

149
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
slight touch to the sack. In what

150
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,080
context? Like if No, you just said you

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,600
don't like being slightly grazed. You

152
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
started listing body parts and I want to

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,039
know about your sack. If something

154
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,199
slightly grazed my ball sack. Is this

155
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,199
what you're asking? Is I don't know if I

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,600
like this podcast.

157
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,919
Jokes that we normally make. Seems so

158
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,039
serious. Well, Chris just asked me if

159
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,000
being slightly grazed in my ball sack

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,880
area would bother me. And I think the

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,520
answer is yes. I do. For me, it's never

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,520
like bothersome because it's almost a

163
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
sense of how often is this happening?

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,199
because it's almost a sense of relief

165
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
that it wasn't full-fledged contact. All

166
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,639
right, can we get into something in this

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,960
basket or little naughty question? You

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,280
want to know what I do often? What? I

169
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,639
click on depot instead of Door Dash.

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
Never happened to me ever. And then I'm

171
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,840
like, why is Door Dash selling $20

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,840
current day issues?

173
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
Let's throw that one on the screen. Make

174
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
it a viral thing. Huh? Yeah, let's do

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,759
it. #curren What was it? Current day

176
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,360
issues. Yeah. Yeah. Like millennial

177
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,400
problems.

178
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,280
Gen Gen Z issues. Do you do you know

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,680
what you are? Nah, I think I'm Gen Z.

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,039
What are we at? Who? What's being alpha

181
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,759
or gen beta? I think it's Craven.

182
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,680
Is it Craven Morehead? I think this

183
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,400
generation Craven Morehead. I think it's

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,720
Craven Morehead. Is this new generation

185
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,319
generation Craven Morehead? Has to be

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,479
one of the funniest things I've ever

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
heard. All right, let me open one of

188
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,160
these questions, please. What the What

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,160
else is in here? It's Matt's mystery B.

190
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
No, there's so many things in Why would

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
the [ __ ] would you do that? Cuz I'm

192
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
curious. No, no idea what's happening.

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,759
It's Matt's thing. Shuffle them around

194
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
first. No way. I just pulled this one.

195
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,919
What does it say? What does it say? What

196
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
do you mean? Oh, thank you. For the

197
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,120
picnic. A shakuderie snack board. Have

198
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,520
you ever met someone for the picnic? Are

199
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,160
you ready? Have you ever met someone

200
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,000
named Craven

201
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,759
Morgan? What's one family rule we had

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,800
that in hindsight was completely

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,360
unnecessary? Um, I would say no

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,360
swearing.

205
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
I mean, it that rule ended up backfiring

206
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
because now it's my favorite swear all

207
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
the time every day. Yeah, I'll tell you

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,960
right now. I love salami. Chill. I don't

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,599
want you to eat it. You like pepperoni?

210
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,479
I do. I love pepperoni. Why does your

211
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,039
salami look different than mine? Cuz

212
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,440
this is pepperoni and that's salami. Oh,

213
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
so it is different. I got salami. What

214
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
are you asking? What's the question at

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,520
hand? I'm asking why his salami looked

216
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,160
different but on The untold secret was

217
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,919
it was pepperoni. The secret was told.

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
There was no secret. Do you want to know

219
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,680
the keeper of untold secrets? Yes. His

220
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,919
name is Craven

221
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Moore. I go hot and I make it look easy.

222
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,080
They're the coolest. Okay. I know. I got

223
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,759
Nick one of these. All right. Just got

224
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,919
this. Are you Sorry. Are you guys

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
enjoying these things? Yeah, they're a

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
little hard, but when I don't like them

227
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,879
when you mix it with cheese, it's fire.

228
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,440
Vanilla cupcake goldfish. I know how

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
much you love them. [ __ ] I know. Matt

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
just bought the grossest thing in the

231
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,080
store. Holy [ __ ] I know how much those

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
mean to you.

233
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,760
I wish you gave these to me first cuz

234
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
now I got salami in my face and I want

235
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
this instead.

236
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
No, seriously. Thank you, Matt. Wait, is

237
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,040
there someone behind the camera? It's

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Craven. This Oh my god, it's Craven.

239
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,519
This joke isn't funny anymore. Just

240
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,519
kidding. It's the

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,000
I literally just heard your echo stop.

242
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,120
It took that full four seconds. I'm

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,279
taking another question. It took four

244
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,279
[ __ ] seconds to miss you. I'm taking

245
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,920
another question out of this. My energy

246
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,600
is on top level, Doug.

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
I kind of really want a soda. I wish I

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
didn't drink that. I love when Nick

249
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
moves around like I just don't want

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,519
anything I got. Well, no, Matt. It's

251
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,920
like I It's like you got me [ __ ] This

252
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
is the the the picnic essentials, dude.

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,399
Oh my god.

254
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
It kind of looks like Daffy Duck is

255
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,560
yelling at himself like in a in an

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
infinite glitch. You are the [ __ ]

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
weirdest person I know. You know what I

258
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
mean? Look, he's like, "Hey." And then

259
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
it goes to the next one and he's like,

260
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
"Whoa." And then he's like saying it

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
essentially. Do you think it's

262
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,920
exclusively hey and wo or do you think

263
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,959
he's just No, those are my

264
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,440
interpretations. If your brain was a

265
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,680
house, what weird room would you have in

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,000
it?

267
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,360
Okay. Um, I definitely would have a room

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,959
where like there's like a guy at the

269
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,800
door and he stands at the door and he's

270
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,200
like, "Is this going to be Hello, I'm

271
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,680
Craven Morhead." And he's like, "It's

272
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,920
the Craven Morehead layer." Okay, so

273
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,959
this is the room in my house. I'm going

274
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,720
to set this. I don't think that's the

275
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,040
question, but in my brain house, imagine

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,600
you walk into the room. Okay, close your

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,200
eyes. It's pitch black out of nowhere.

278
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,040
Craven. If you guys know, if there's one

279
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
more Craven Morhead joke, I'm walking

280
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,279
off. Then you walk up, you open the

281
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
room, you still can't see anything. It's

282
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,000
pitch black. You try to feel around

283
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,200
what's in there. So, you walk in one

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,680
step, another another. You find yourself

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
in a very dark room in the dead center

286
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
and you look back and the only light is

287
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,959
admitting through the doorway you just

288
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:51,200
came in. Boom. LeBron James. The doorway

289
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:55,120
shuts. No. The lights turn on and you

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,839
look down and the whole floor is covered

291
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,600
by treadmills and it goes zoom zoom zoom

292
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
and it starts speeding up and now you

293
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,720
have to move forward and you look back

294
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,040
and there's just no the wall that you

295
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,920
came in on is gone and there's just a

296
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,760
steep drop down afterward. What does

297
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,279
this represent for you mentally? And

298
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,920
then you just have to start running and

299
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,320
running and running and running. Never

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,720
know what happens until you stop

301
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,519
running. I'm taking a guess that you

302
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,240
would fall if you stopped running. Nope.

303
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,880
If I had a room in my brain, it would be

304
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
There we go.

305
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
What are you saying? Here we go. Like

306
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,839
you didn't just say the stupidest answer

307
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
to mankind. Are we going to like ignore

308
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
that or what? So, let me guess. Are you

309
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,680
in a really dark dark dark No, I'm

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,160
actually Then all of a sudden, Craven

311
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,480
Morehead in a LeBron James jersey walks

312
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,120
in. Go ahead, Matt. Go ahead. Sorry.

313
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,600
It's 5:57 on a spring evening and the

314
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,000
and the sun is about to set but it's not

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,079
fully set. So, it's kind of like that

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,720
cloudy gray that it gives. 557. Yeah. In

317
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,720
spring. Yes.

318
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
The the winter soul size didn't change

319
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,200
the time yet. So, it's like springy

320
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,000
weather and it's like it's I love the

321
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,880
adjective springy. It's it's it's on the

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,200
verge of like it's like hoodie at the

323
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,600
campfire weather, but also like you had

324
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,440
shorts and a t-shirt on the whole day.

325
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,279
That type of vibe. And it's a c it's a

326
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,720
it's a treehouse in the top of a 750T

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,839
tree. Oh, 750T. I'd be scared out of my

328
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,240
[ __ ] And that's it. 750T tall tree is

329
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,839
insanity. Yep. And it's a giant spiral

330
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,720
staircase all the way down. Or it's a

331
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,200
Or it's a monkey pulled elevator. Monkey

332
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,240
pulled.

333
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,760
No, hold on. Seems like a lot. No, it's

334
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
not. That's it. I feel like maybe like a

335
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,440
little tree excavator. And it's like an

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,079
excavator, but it's like an escalator.

337
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
What's an esavator? Is that a thing? An

338
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,240
esavator is like a construction site.

339
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Like a big chewing in the mic, by the

340
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,560
way, too. An elevator, but it's made by

341
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,800
like woodbinding apes. What the [ __ ] is

342
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
going on? No, I think an actual room in

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,279
my head would be like a Nick. Do you

344
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
know who Josh Allen is? No. He's married

345
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,760
to I think there would be like a really

346
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,959
cool Here's a hint. He plays for the

347
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,040
Buffalo Bills. What position?

348
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,639
Quarterback. Whoa. That was good, Nick.

349
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
Nice. That was really good. Good work.

350
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,440
Thank you. Thank you. That moment when

351
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,440
Nick defies all odds. Yep. Okay.

352
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Defhound.

353
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,519
I'm

354
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,880
defying gravity.

355
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,920
All right, we're going to rifle off

356
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
these questions. We're going to like get

357
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,079
really like we're going to we have to be

358
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,200
entertaining. Hold on. Let me take my

359
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:49,200
sweater off. Okay, are we ready?

360
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,800
Defying gravity. No wizard that there is

361
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,639
or what? Would any of you guys like a

362
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
slim gym before we start? [ __ ] No,

363
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
dude. Did you go into the grocery store

364
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,600
and say, "Let me get the nastiest things

365
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,160
that I can even [ __ ] buy." Fig. What?

366
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
Fig Newton. Who goes? Imagine checking

367
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,240
it. I'm just trying to imagine the

368
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,800
cashier vanilla covered yogurts. Oh my

369
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,560
god. What is wrong with you? I was

370
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,199
trying to be picnicy. I was trying to be

371
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,519
all picnic vibes. I think you failed

372
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,000
tremendously. But no, you didn't like

373
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,199
little like cracker [ __ ] gyms. I I

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
think that like in my personal hell

375
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,240
would be like it'd be like while I'm

376
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,279
waiting in purgatory while they decide

377
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,800
my fate, they're like they like feed me.

378
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
I was going to say a crazy thing. I was

379
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,680
going to say like a neverending slim

380
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,160
joke, but that's like insane. But like

381
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,480
like dream like what? Your biggest

382
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,959
dream. Okay, Nick. I actually your room

383
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,959
and your whipped cream and I'm like what

384
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,639
the [ __ ] are you? My biggest dream is a

385
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,079
never- ending meat stick. Shut your

386
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,920
mouth. I got you. Dude, you said it. I

387
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,680
didn't. No, I You literally said it. I

388
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,120
didn't. No, you implied. It hit your

389
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
brain first. You were the first one to

390
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
bring up a never- ending. You were the

391
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,399
first person to bring up Craven Warhead.

392
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,399
So, yeah. Newsp fire. Um, Nick, this one

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:07,279
you'll actually like. I got you dots,

394
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:10,160
dude. These Oh, no. They're all stuck

395
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,760
together. No, they're not. Open it. Mac,

396
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,560
can I see it? You probably bought the

397
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,519
most heinous possible things on the

398
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,160
planet at the grocery store. Like right

399
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,760
in my face. You wanted to see it and I

400
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
forgot that like you had to be conscious

401
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,240
that I was throwing it at you. Is it?

402
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,240
Anybody want uh Mr. Beast Bar? I really

403
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,360
don't. Is there an almond one? I already

404
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,199
said no. They didn't. I'm good. Okay.

405
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,240
Anybody want Pixar gummies?

406
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,000
What did you do?

407
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,279
Ow. That's what you get. You want Pixar

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,279
gummies? What happened to you? There's

409
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,800
like a sharp thing in there, Matt.

410
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,560
Nobody wants these. And you don't

411
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,519
either. This slim gym's kind of like

412
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,759
weirdly. I do want a Pixar gummy. I knew

413
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,320
you did. They're right there. Like cuz

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,600
these look really unique. How quickly

415
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,279
you guys know that game show and it's

416
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,480
like the things pop up on the screen.

417
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,519
How well do you think cheesecake apple

418
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,600
pie chocolate chip cookie first

419
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,480
name now that you're choosing this? I

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,079
was going to say first one to name

421
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,320
Nemo's dad, but I said his name by

422
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,480
accident. Try again. What was his name?

423
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,399
Mark.

424
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,040
Marlin. Marlin. Mark. Yeah, he was a

425
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,040
[ __ ] white

426
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,639
man. Yeah, Mark. Nemo's dad's flipping

427
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,160
some burgers on Fourth of July.

428
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,920
Okay, give me I feel like everybody has

429
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,560
an Uncle Mark. We don't have an Uncle

430
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,759
Mark. So, already done there, right? I

431
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
came up with some good questions. Let's

432
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
go through these. Okay. If you had to

433
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
fight a clone of yourselves, what would

434
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,040
be your strategy? Oh my god. Crispy

435
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,440
cream donuts at the top of the stairs

436
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,759
with a spike trap. I would really want

437
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,160
to strike panic into my own self. So,

438
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,839
what I would do is I would hide in my

439
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,720
room and wait for the lights to shut

440
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
off. Cuz this is a serious fear of mine.

441
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
I have a fear that the second my lights

442
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,519
go off in my room and I lay in bed at

443
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
night, someone's already in my bed. Oh

444
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,720
my god. With like a knife or something.

445
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,319
Like when I lift up my blanket, I just

446
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
slip it. Can I say my biggest fear when

447
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
I'm my most vulnerable is probably being

448
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,919
completely naked in the shower. Like

449
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,400
whenever I'm completely naked in the

450
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,480
shower, I completely always That's when

451
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,160
you have to get your clone. No, no, no.

452
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
Shower. Like I'd still be so

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,120
uncomfortable like immediately. What is

454
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,520
this thing for? It's me fixing my

455
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,520
posture cuz like this is what it is is

456
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,039
because like I'm fully naked and there's

457
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,840
no in the shower there's no fabric or

458
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,600
like cover anything covering my body.

459
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,600
When I'm in the shower I have this

460
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,440
immediate panic that like something's

461
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,280
just going to rip all the skin off my

462
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
body and I'm going to be like stuck.

463
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,720
This pepperoni is dog [ __ ] Dude, no one

464
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,039
gives a [ __ ] But do you know what I'm

465
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
saying? Whenever I whenever I like am

466
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
like whenever I look or focus too much

467
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
like I look at my hands I just imagine

468
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
like cutting off one of my fingers one

469
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,919
at a time with like hedge clippers or

470
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,679
something. What? That's not good, Nick.

471
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,200
No, like No, but like not in like a like

472
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,960
I want to do it. It's just like I I'd be

473
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
so afraid if that happened. I know

474
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,840
exactly how I'd get mad. Like the other

475
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
day I was cutting a pizza and I was

476
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,840
cutting like a with a pizza cutter and I

477
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,600
just imagine just like

478
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,440
right over your fingers. No, like my

479
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,360
whole body just skinning myself with the

480
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
[ __ ] pizza cutter.

481
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,240
Wow, that'd be so awful. Go ahead,

482
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,360
Chris. I would drive real slow in front

483
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,960
of Matt in the car in his clone and then

484
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,559
his clone behind would get real angry

485
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
and try to pass. And the second he

486
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,799
passes when he looks at me like, "Yo,

487
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,280
what the fuck?" I'd have a gun. Oh my

488
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,760
god. And then I'd just shoot him. Whoa.

489
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,000
Wait, what was the question?

490
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
I forget. I also was the question. How

491
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,600
would we get our clones? Was the

492
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
question a complete demise? If you had

493
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,080
to fight a clone of yourselves, what

494
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,640
would fight? to the death. I don't know.

495
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,360
I think my strategy would be go for like

496
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,520
the my knee pits first. Knee pits? Yeah.

497
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,640
I hate getting hit in my knee pit. You

498
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,160
know how when you like kick the back of

499
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
your knee pit and it folds your legs?

500
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,799
Oh, that's my biggest pet peeve. I think

501
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,200
I try to kidnap yourself. Me? Yeah. I

502
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,880
don't think you're trying to fight like

503
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
a fight to the death. You're trying to

504
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
fight yourself? Yes. You need to answer

505
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
this question for yourself. Is it Am I

506
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
trying to kill somebody? You're trying

507
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
to fight your clone. I don't know how.

508
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
It says fight your clone. Fight

509
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,960
yourself. So, you're not fighting me. If

510
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
you had to fight a clone of yourself,

511
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
what would be your Oh, okay. And it's

512
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
also like not to the death. It's like

513
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,919
fight. I already said mine, though. Hide

514
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
in the bed. Hide in your bed. I think

515
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
Chris, it would be so funny if you um I

516
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
just imagine Chris like going into his

517
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,720
room and like there's like a a snack on

518
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,280
the floor or something like he's a

519
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,440
carrot cake and it's on it's on like a

520
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,600
red visible target and he steps in it

521
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,200
and like a big mouse trap like a

522
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,760
humanized mouse. I would never, first of

523
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,360
all, ever grab carrot cake off my ground

524
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,120
and then just start eating it. Chris,

525
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
really, really dig deep and tell me

526
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,280
that's the truth. 100%. If there is a a

527
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,360
good That's obviously bait.

528
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,679
I'm never going to run into floor carrot

529
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,919
cake in my bedroom.

530
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,679
You would do it though for your your ass

531
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
would get caught in the buffalo chicken

532
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,360
one.

533
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,919
Slow down. Yeah, you heard me. Slow

534
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,600
down. Like a more realistic option is

535
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
like a Kit Kat. Like if I found a Kit

536
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
Kat, I'd be like, "Oh shit." Like it has

537
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,799
to be something that I could have just

538
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
told me that he leaves candy and money

539
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,799
in his pockets of his winter coats so

540
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,960
that when the winter comes around, candy

541
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,320
is not. When I was 10, I did candy.

542
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,679
You're an adult. Now I just do the

543
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,120
money. You just still do the money? Yes.

544
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,919
No. Do you think someone's head ever

545
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,400
exploded going into outer space?

546
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,600
Definitely. That's so scary.

547
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,960
Don't worry, Chris. No one's going to

548
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,799
make me go out. You want to know what I

549
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,440
would do if I was lost in space and I

550
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,760
and I came back? If I was lost in space,

551
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,080
I'd come back with the craziest lies

552
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,320
ever. I'd be like, "We landed on like a

553
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,640
planet very far out of our solar system

554
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,240
and there was other humans." What's that

555
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,480
big movie with the one with the planet

556
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,840
far away? Star Wars. Oh yeah, that's it.

557
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,360
Happy Gilmore 2. Okay. Need to rewatch

558
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
the first one and then I'll see what's

559
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
going on. Need to rewatch the first one.

560
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,200
The second. Was there a guy who died and

561
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,280
he saw a ghost? No. Yes. He got crushed

562
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,640
by the air conditioner or bit by the

563
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,720
crocodile. He got knocked out of the air

564
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
conditioner or bit by the crocodile.

565
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
That was that guy.

566
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
Was that the guy who died got bit by the

567
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,360
crocodile? Wait, I could also be

568
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
thinking of a totally different Adam

569
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,440
Sandler movie. No, because at the end

570
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm pretty sure there's like three

571
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,880
people that seems like you know what I'm

572
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,880
talking about. I don't remember. I need

573
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
to rewatch this movie. Definitely an

574
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,799
Last time I saw Anthony the Crocodile

575
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,960
got one of them. Last time I saw that

576
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,320
movie, I was 12 years old. That movie is

577
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,400
so good to my remembrance. All right.

578
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:40,280
Freaking No. No. But also, he's a Bruins

579
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,280
fan. He is. He is. That's it.

580
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,520
Whoa. Go Bruins. Whoa. Can we talk about

581
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,520
how the Bruins traded Brad Maron?

582
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,679
Why would we trade Brad Marshon?

583
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Thank you for that. Shopping up to

584
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,880
Boston.

585
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,760
Thank you for that. Freaky Friday. Yeah.

586
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,640
What the freakier Friday? Freaky Friday.

587
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,720
We should start calling Sternolo Friday.

588
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,440
Okay. Freaky Friday.

589
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,080
You're a dumbass. Just kidding. Freaky

590
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,280
Friday. The original. Yeah. Jamie Lee

591
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,280
Curtis. Lindsay Lohan coming back.

592
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,880
Freaky Friday. Freaky or Friday. Not

593
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,080
going to be as good. Definitely not

594
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,559
going to be as good. Not going to be as

595
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,159
good. My my

596
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,760
my um my expectations are low. Really? I

597
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,360
like how she was. My expectations are of

598
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,200
course low. The first movie was

599
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,320
unbelievable. First movie is really Is

600
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
that where she meets the guy at the

601
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,400
Chinese restaurant? Yes. The woman the

602
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,760
fortune cookie is is the reason

603
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,679
why sky high though. That's where um Oh

604
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,360
my god. No, not Blaze. What's his name?

605
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,720
Oh. Um, War in Peace. Yes. And um, he

606
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
like heats something up. And what's her

607
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,159
name? Ivy Girl. Ivy Girl. What's her

608
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,440
name? I don't know. Love her. Love her.

609
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
My favorite scene in that movie is when

610
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
she's with like the cheerleaders and the

611
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,240
cheerleaders are like and they're doing

612
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,520
their cheer and they're like they're

613
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,760
like turning into a bunch of different

614
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
girls and they're like and then they

615
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,159
like there's more of them and they're

616
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,640
doing like their whole routine and then

617
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,480
they like get mad at her because it was

618
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,919
like sidekick or hero and you're like a

619
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,679
hero if you have a good power and a

620
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,280
sidekick if you suck. And she like

621
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,919
didn't want to use her powers leave

622
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,400
anything for

623
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:34,000
she wanted to the girl start the grass

624
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,039
girl Ivy girl. No stop. The grass girl

625
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,799
believed she was like oh you could

626
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,280
she's like oh grass girl hit the

627
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,280
cheerleader and she was all like you can

628
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,120
only use your powers for good is what

629
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,559
she believed. So what she would do my

630
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,840
mic again and I'll [ __ ] slit your

631
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,480
throat. So what she would do is she

632
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,840
wouldn't use her powers if pro if told

633
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,080
to. She had to be provoked. So don't do

634
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,360
not pull another question. So what

635
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,360
happened was she was provoked by the

636
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,799
cheerleader girls to use her powers and

637
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,400
one of the hardest bars in the movie.

638
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,799
They're like, "Oh, we thought you were a

639
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,039
sidekick." And she's like, "I don't

640
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,279
know.

641
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,799
You forgot Nick." She's like, "I am a

642
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,080
sidekick or something." I don't know.

643
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,760
But it's cool. all that.

644
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,720
I literally don't remember what they

645
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,840
said. It was like

646
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,279
that was like all the girls. You're the

647
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,279
dumbest person I've ever met in my whole

648
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,799
life. I don't No, you remember I'm

649
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,279
talking about that. She's like Cuz the

650
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,360
the cheerleader girl cuz that's also

651
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,039
what was so [ __ ] sick is the

652
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,799
cheerleader girl. She's a twin. No. Is

653
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,840
she? Yeah. You're telling me cuz you

654
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,799
think that's what I'm going to say? I'm

655
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,720
telling you the truth. She Listen, she

656
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,240
listen. She was the whole [ __ ]

657
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,200
cheerleader squad cuz she could

658
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,000
teleport. No, she's a wife. No,

659
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,760
duplicate. Not teleport. What is that?

660
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,520
Duplicate. Yeah, cuz she was the whole

661
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,440
cheerleader squad cuz she was one

662
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,840
person. That was like nine people. There

663
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,679
was her superpower cuz she's a twin in

664
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,360
real life. What are you saying? It's

665
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,960
easier to clone somebody when there's

666
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,880
already two people to reference. Matt,

667
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,600
what I'm telling you is there was no

668
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,000
cheer squad for Sky High except her cuz

669
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,799
her superpower was cloning herself. So,

670
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,279
how [ __ ] sick is that? She's like,

671
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,159
she's What I'm telling you is that girl

672
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,120
in real life is a twin. I'm talking

673
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,440
about the fictional movie Sky. I don't

674
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,600
care. The person the I'm talking about a

675
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,080
superpower. The reason why she can

676
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
duplicate in the show is because instead

677
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
of making one girl duplicate eight

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,159
times, it's two girls and they made them

679
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,120
duplicate. Wrong. Because if you I I'm

680
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,080
not saying you're wrong that she's a

681
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,480
twin. I'm saying you're wrong that

682
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,240
that's the reason why she has the power.

683
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
Yes, of course it's easier. But Liv and

684
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,880
Maddie were both Dove Cameron. So, how

685
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,279
do you beat that one? Which I don't

686
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,640
believe. Like, they look totally

687
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,480
different. Chris, it literally glasses

688
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,320
and a [ __ ] side part was the only It

689
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,760
literally looks like two completely

690
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,080
different. And she's a good She was a

691
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,279
good like kid actor.

692
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,240
So, it was like I was like I was

693
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,240
convinced. Double the role.

694
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,200
If you had to describe your type using

695
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,600
only three fictional characters, who

696
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
would it be? Easy, easy, easy, easy,

697
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,919
easy. Candace from Phineas and FB, Sandy

698
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,080
Cheeks, and Nogops. Sandy Cheeks. Candy.

699
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,480
Candace from Phineas and Ferb. Yeah, cuz

700
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,279
she's kind of annoying. I'd probably say

701
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Craven Morehead. Nick, stop. That's a

702
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,960
really good one. Um, I need What's that

703
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,440
dude that was always doing jumping jacks

704
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,440

705
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,200
I have no clue. Who was doing the giving

706
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,960

708
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,080
I have no clue who was doing jumping

709
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,440
jacks for apples. That's like Nick's

710
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
tight though. Who was doing jumping

711
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,799
jacks? Like some weird liveaction Sesame

712
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,919
Street or something. Liveaction Sesame

713
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,440
Street. I don't know. That's like the

714
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,240
We're talking about cartoon characters.

715
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,039
Chris, jumping jacks for apples. I don't

716
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,720

718
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,400
next question? I probably Oh, Chris is

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,480
talking about um the dude that wears

720
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,279
blue in Oh my god.

721
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,600
Um Spicus.

722
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,039
Yeah, Sporicus, but he's not a cartoon.

723
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,480
But yeah, you're not wrong at all.

724
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,799

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,919
or Velma, to be honest. Both of them at

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,120
the same time. Both of them. Two bad

728
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,000

the same damn time. Scooby Melman do.

732
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
You remember my favorite scene in the

733
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,120
Scooby-Doo live action movie is when

734
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,880
Scooby-Doo is at the end and he Well,

735
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,520
no, no. Early this is this whole thing

736
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,960
is just me explaining movies. Earlier on

737
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,640
in the movie, there's like a call and

738
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,000
it's for Scooby and they're trying to

739
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
like lure him out to the woods. They

740
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,120
call him on the phone. They're like,

741
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
"Oh, it's a call for Scooby." And then

742
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,440
or or it's a call for There's going to

743
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,279
be another You like to like, "Oh, we

744
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,039
have to figure out." I do remember this.

745
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,240
They're at like the bar at like Spooky

746
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,360
Island and there's a call and they're

747
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,880
like, "Oh, we need um we need

748
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,039
Scooby-Doo." And then the guy's like,

749
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,640
"Oh, uh is are you talking about me? I'm

750
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,080
Melman." And he's like, "No, like we

751
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
need Scooby." And then Scooby-Doo walks

752
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
over and answers the phone. And then at

753
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,120
the end, they're doing like the

754
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,720
possession, like Scooby-Doo is getting

755
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,640
possessed and they're like, "We need a

756
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,440
sacrifice." And Scrappy's like, "It's

757
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,520
going to be Scooby-Doo." And Scooby

758
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,320
goes, "Do you mean Melman do?" And he

759
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,720
points at the guy. That's really funny.

760
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,440
It's so [ __ ] funny. Okay, next. But I

761
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,880
want to just like sit and like allow a

762
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,679
Oh my god. You could trade one skill you

763
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,760
have for a completely random new one,

764
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,760
would you do it? I would want the

765
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,240
ability I don't know what skill I have

766
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,200
now that I'd trade actually fully know.

767
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,600
If I could trade the ability to edit

768
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
videos, if I I wish I could forget how

769
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
to edit videos that it was one of your

770
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,240
jobs. What I would do is what or what

771
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,799
ability I really want is to be able to

772
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,080
make a beautiful, gorgeous, perfect

773
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,960
house of cards with a full deck of 52.

774
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,480
Wow, that's really good. I would turn in

775
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,200
my ability of being a kind, thoughtful

776
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,840
guy into being the most evil person ever

777
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,880
and take over the city and get Craven

778
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,919
Morehead on your side. Next question. I

779
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,960
don't have an answer to that question.

780
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,159
And even if I did, Chris just ended my

781
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:33,039
opportunity. Money talks. Money talks.

782
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
Dirty cash. I want you. Dirty cash. I

783
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,279
need you.

784
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,320
I really love the genius design of the

785
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,799
feastable bar where it's unlike any

786
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,279
other chocolate. Do you know that I've

787
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,279
not given you any money cuz I'm not

788
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,000
being sponsored or paid for by Mr.

789
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,159
Beast. You get I want to be in a Beast

790
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,240
video. I want to do it. I see so many

791
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,039
other YouTubers being a Mr. Beast video.

792
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,799
I want to do it. Look, there's the

793
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,440
That's my cry for help. Beast, get me in

794
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,760
a video. I'm I'm ready. There's three

795
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,080
along the side and then it's a full bar.

796
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,960
Do you want to know the full bar? I'm

797
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,880
actually going to show you. I'm a true

798
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,600
Beast fan. Do you know why he did that?

799
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,760
Why? Because in the original version,

800
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,000
Mr. Beast, See how the long one, see the

801
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,440
long one? Do you see it? Look at it.

802
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,320
Take a look at the long one with no

803
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,600
brakes. The original chocolate bar was

804
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,840
all one big bar with no brakes at all.

805
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,000
But he said in the design process when

806
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,640
he put it in stores on shelves it would

807
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,720
tip over and shatter like glass because

808
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,640
those breaks are basically to like give

809
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,880
you a guide of where to break it to eat

810
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,880
it.

811
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,039
Last

812
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,320
what

813
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,840
what I just put two pieces of a

814
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,520
breakable bar in my mouth instead of

815
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,600
splitting it in half. I thought Craven

816
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,720
Morehead was about to be here. All

817
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,000
right, you ready? Last question. Matt.

818
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
Yep. He's gonna answer the other one

819
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
now. What's one thing you've been

820
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,960
meaning to do for a long time, but still

821
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,480
haven't?

822
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,240
Meet Graven Morehead. I like to get like

823
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,279
a little bit on the edge and talk about

824
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,440
these. Stop doing that.

825
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,360
Hey, help Marot. Nick, do you think you

826
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,799
could deep throat this whole mic? Please

827
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,799
don't ask. What's one thing you've been

828
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,039

834
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,559

effort into. And every single one that I

889
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,760
filmed individually, I put in tons of

890
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,279
effort alone to do it. And I can't

891
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,440
believe that I've been keeping secrets

892
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,279
from you guys for so long. And I just

893
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,519

905
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,639
Something about Are you recording

906
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,720
Chris? Chris, my [ __ ] deal.

907
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,399
Something about using a credit card to

908
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,760
pay the meter just feels wrong. Like I

909
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,040
don't use a credit card to get a [ __ ]

910
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,560
gumball. We should get a roll of

911
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,159
quarters. I think that that'd be a good

912
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,320
fun thing. But you know what I mean?

913
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,599
Yeah. All right, guys. We are going to

914
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,200
our tour rehearsals today, but we're

915
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
going to eat right now before we go to

916
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,320
tour rehearsals. So, come along with us.

917
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,560
I'm wearing my purple I'm going to get

918
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,240
like little I'm wearing my purple I'm

919
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,839
wearing my purple shoes because we're

920
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,200
doing tour rehearsals and it's not the

921
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,839
versus tour, but I feel like this is

922
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,839
like emulating my tour energy that I

923
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,839
need so deep in my

924
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,320
bones. You're a [ __ ] freak. Let's go.

925
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,320

926
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,560
that's me and my food over here. Yeah,

927
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,240

928
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,839
about eating breakfast today and our

929
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,680
hearts are racing. Our hearts are racing

930
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,800
and we're all nervous and I think that

931
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,480
we've all we all like inconveniencing or

932
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,200
bothering people around me. Yeah, we all

933
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,800
definitely have also a form of social

934
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,160
anxiety. You know what I mean? Majorly

935
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,160
like really bad. And I think what really

936
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,440
encouraged this this Where are you

937
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,440
going? What really encouraged this

938
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,359
action of vlogging breakfast is

939
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,760
yesterday we were walking on Rodeo Drive

940
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,440
and saw four people Instagram live. One

941
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,240
of them screaming and doing push-ups

942
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,240
shirtless. So it's like we are not we

943
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,599
are not a site for sore eyes during the

944
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,680
other [ __ ] that's going. If you live in

945
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,359
LA it's normal that people are creating

946
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,119

947
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,400

I just wanted to switch it up. And I was

951
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,040

953
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,800

954
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,240

957
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,480

958
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,480
a million dollars nowadays.

959
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,839
I should have got four of these. I'm

960
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,720

961
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,680
[ __ ] Black Panther on the thing. This

962
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,839
one might kill me. How would they not

963
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,599
go? This is good as [ __ ] though. What

964
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,040
is that one? Trio. I ordered like a trio

965
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,240

966
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,680
lady's like, "It's okay. It's the pond."

967
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Like, "Thank you for making me feel less

968
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,240
[ __ ]

969
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,960
stupid." Petition to What am I doing?

972
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,480
so confused. It's like the ceiling's

973
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,200
half open, half closed, and I like the

974
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,480
lights.

975
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,480
Yeah, this is really nice lighting.

976
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,839
Yeah. I don't like um lots like any

977
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,760
loads of cream. I don't like Oh my god.

978
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm I'm with that. Like a big load of

979
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,960
sour cream or like a big load of

980
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,079

Not my like big load of um like mayo.

982
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,079

seeping out of your like mouth. Get get
