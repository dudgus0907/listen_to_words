1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
I am making it a goal of mine to sit

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,200
with perfect posture today.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,240
Oh god, that's not happening. Edit

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,639
farming within a minute.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,440
Do your legs get numb laying like while

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,920
we film?

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,080
No.

8
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
Like I look at you and I feel a sense of

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,160
Does your neck get numb sitting like

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,679
that every day?

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
I am sitting with perfect posture.

12
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
No, you're not.

13
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
All right. Can we start off today's

14
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
video by doing something I want to do?

15
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
Of course we can. We can start off his

16
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,840
video. He

17
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
does that. I hate when he does that.

18
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,599
Go, go, go, go. What do you want to Are

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
you sure we can do something to start

20
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,760
off today's video doing something that I

21
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,399
want to do? Yes, I'm sure. I bought a

22
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,719
diet Dr. Pepper case simply for like the

23
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,600
aesthetic of how cute the cans are. Like

24
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,079
the white on maroon is just so much more

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
appealing to me. Like and I eat with my

26
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
eyes first before I consume.

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,800
Oh my god.

28
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
It's true. I feel like I just look like

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,079
a little delicious berry dessert today.

30
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,640
I

31
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,199
purple purple sweats on. My shirt has a

32
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
pink logo. says Homo American.

33
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
All right, so we didn't start the video

34
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,760
how I wanted to.

35
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
That's because you didn't rip the floor

36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,000
from beneath our feet and you have to.

37
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,199
I want to start it by each listing at

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
least

39
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,040
two to three things we don't like.

40
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,760
Two to three things or like things that

41
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
would bother you.

42
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
Has anyone ever seen a clip of me ever

43
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,240
complaining?

44
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,520
Like I don't really do that. So it's

45
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,960
like it's really hard for me to think of

46
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,600
something I don't like. I don't really

47
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,080
complain on this YouTube channel ever.

48
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,560
Um, so it's hard for not like a

49
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,320
negative, not a pessimistic person. How

50
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,320
about a positive? Trevor is here. Trevor

51
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
and Trevor and the rest of the family

52
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,079
are in Los Angeles, California. So

53
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,880
that's been a blast.

54
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
That's why I have dog fur all over me.

55
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
And Trevor was hanging with us on the

56
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
couch, but our my mom went to bed, so of

57
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,079
course he prioritizes her because she's

58
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,479
the lead of his pack. So when she goes

59
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,280
to bed, he must follow suit. You know

60
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,200
what I mean? As as someone who was once

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
a wild creature.

62
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
Yeah.

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,840
To warrant this angry behavior at this

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
grumpy's face.

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Go see dad.

66
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,640
Um I have to wash my hair. I hate the

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
way my hair feels right now

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
and I need to shave. But I am like I

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
want

70
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Is that your number one and number two

71
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
things of

72
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,599
those are my two things that are

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,040
bothering me is my hair and my like

74
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,920
facial hair. Facial hair.

75
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,640
Facial hair. One thing that's really

76
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,640
bothering me, or it's not happening

77
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,760
right this moment, but it does bother

78
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,400
me, is when my ear like pokes out, but

79
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,319
like and my hair like goes on either

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
side of my ear. You know what I mean?

81
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,160
You're serving us leprechaun.

82
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400
When I have hair here and hair here, and

83
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,519
my ear is just like protruding out. If

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,760
you can visibly see my here here, what

85
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,760
is it? I just thought I got a

86
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,959
notification cuz my leg vibrated and my

87
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,040
phone is empty with notifications.

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,200
Second annoying thing I saw today is

89
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,760
this girl was cooking food on my for you

90
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
page. Like crazy good chef. Like you

91
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
could tell she knows what

92
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
crazy good chef.

93
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,800
Yeah. Like she got it.

94
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
A CGC.

95
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Yeah.

96
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
Wow.

97
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
CGC stands for crazy good chef. For

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
those of you that

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
we picked up on that. Nick just invented

100
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
that by the way.

101
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,239
That's been a thing for a while.

102
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
No, it hasn't.

103
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,879
I've been texting. I'm like, "Oh,

104
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
there's like I love this restaurant.

105
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,519
There's a CGC." No, you

106
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,360
I swear to God. But you can keep going.

107
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,440
Never. Never in his life.

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
You're wrong. But this girl was cooking

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
at her house and she was grilling like a

110
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,080
piece of chicken and she was like about

111
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
to plate it like she was taking it off

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,239
and she dropped it in like the dirt.

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
Oh, I'd eat it anyway.

114
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,879
Oh my god. Like imagine.

115
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
I would eat most things if they fell in.

116
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,040
Just imagine like really slow roast

117
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,720
cooking something for like hours and

118
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
then you just drop it on the ground like

119
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
it's

120
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
I can't even imagine that cuz I'd never

121
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
do it. But yeah, it's terrible. Update.

122
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,319
We're back in LA from Japan. Japan was

123
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,040
great. We had a blast. What was your

124
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
favorite part?

125
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
My favorite part was winning Kirby and

126
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
bringing him home.

127
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,239
Okay.

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
And he's safe in he's safe in my bed,

129
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,360
which is amazing. Don't shake your

130
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,720
[Â __Â ] head like you're not the most

131
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
You're not allowed to say anything about

132
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
that, brother.

133
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,080
You want to know my favorite part of

134
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,599
Japan? or not my favorite part, but just

135
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
like my favorite thing to witness

136
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
sometimes.

137
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,439
What?

138
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,760
Nick, not knowingly. He walks very fast

139
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,320
and he knows that he walks very fast,

140
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,519
but there was a couple and I swear to

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,400
God it looked like Nick was trying to

142
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,960
scare them because he was walking so

143
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,360
fast. He was he was

144
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
where their couple or where their where

145
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
that couple's shadow was projecting,

146
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
Nick was stepping over. creeping behind

147
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,880
them. I literally swear if that's like

148
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,320
not the biggest hint to move faster, I

149
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,720
don't know what is. You know what I

150
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,800
mean? If I'm trailing behind you, move.

151
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
And especially that's my biggest that's

152
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,199
my biggest red flag of couples is they

153
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
get so comfortable in love that they

154
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,160
think the whole world has slowed down

155
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,240
that they can gallivant or hold hands

156
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
and peruse through the streets. You need

157
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
to still walk with urgency. I don't care

158
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
that you found the love of your life.

159
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
And you're you're trotting slowly cuz

160
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
nothing matters to you but the situation

161
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
you're in right now cuz what matters to

162
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
me is getting by you.

163
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
Wow.

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,680
And you are taking you much space. I can

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
cuz I'm not going to hurt him. My goal

166
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,400
isn't to big ass with the with the

167
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
changing. Nick was going to be like

168
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,479
right behind.

169
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
If you hear me right behind you, you're

170
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,919
moving too slow.

171
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Yeah. Well, it's like the thing too is

172
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,320
also is I am good at bobbing and

173
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
weaving, believe it or not, because I'm

174
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
not an agile person.

175
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
What did you You did something in Japan.

176
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,840
You literally like like stomped on. Do

177
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,160
you remember? No, this was today.

178
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
What? Today me and Nick are walking down

179
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
the street and like

180
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Oh my god,

181
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,320
no. I can tell the story.

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
I totally can.

183
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,680
No. We're walking across the street and

184
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
we're like diagonally crossing the

185
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
street and there's

186
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
where you are. We're going this way

187
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,360
and there's a car coming this way at us

188
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,360
at us towards us. So we have to kind of

189
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
now move with urgency and there's a

190
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
parked car on the other side of the road

191
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,919
and I went to like squeeze right on the

192
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,759
inside. Like keep in mind I'm on the

193
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,360
right, Nick's on the left.

194
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
That's correct. That's a true fact.

195
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Correct. Which means so which means on

196
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:21,600
therefore so therefore so therefore may

197
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,600
I say may I say mic are you Nick no

198
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,199
don't unplug my mic I'm not going to

199
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
unplug it I'm going to mute it

200
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
that's the thing too though don't mess

201
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,759
with the soundboard cuz if you mute me

202
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,039
for the whole video I'm going to snap

203
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,720
your collar bone I if you try to say

204
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
can I say something small something

205
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,199
something small and short

206
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,280
no I'm trying to take the closest route

207
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,440
I hand to the car and like hug against

208
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,680
it cuz I know that Nick's to my left,

209
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
right? And he's like taking the outside

210
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
lane and like pinning me into the car to

211
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,440
the point where I had to like shove him

212
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
and be like I was like Nick I'm like

213
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
there's a car here like I had to get by

214
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
him and I go he

215
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,120
I just Okay, hold on. I just want to say

216
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
be I know you're like on the end of

217
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,800
finishing your thought and Nick's

218
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,800
definitely going to state his opinion. I

219
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,759
just want to say I agree with Chris

220
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
before whatever happens.

221
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
Hold on. Actually, like hold this can up

222
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,520
right. And now Nick, hold my microphone

223
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,240
up. Seriously. Yes. You have to Nick for

224
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,840
the story. I'm trying to go like this by

225
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,720
the car so I can Nick has this much

226
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,160
space. And instead of us both walking,

227
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,680
instead of us both walking by the cars

228
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,880
like this,

229
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,759
he's like this and like pinning me into

230
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,319
actually.

231
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
Shockingly, I'm so like I'm really

232
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,960
really impressed by your story. Out of

233
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,319
my way.

234
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,759
Shockingly, it is the complete opposite.

235
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,680
We were walking and I was on the left

236
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,080
like like Chris stated and he was on the

237
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,400
right. And with you being on the right

238
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
means I am closer to the center of the

239
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,599
street and I'm closer to the park. With

240
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,400
that being said, with that being said,

241
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,240
Chris, before we got over there, we were

242
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
walking diagonally across the street.

243
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,720
When we were in the middle of the

244
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,240
street, I was on the left. Chris was on

245
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,639
the right. If you're in the middle of

246
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,160
the street and you're crossing it to the

247
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
right,

248
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,080
who has more room to walk? The person on

249
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,080
the left or the person on the right?

250
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
We're go We were going this way though.

251
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
We're crossing crossing. We're crossing

252
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
this way diagonally.

253
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,639
Your approach only makes sense if you're

254
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,639
going straight parallel across the

255
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
street. We're going at a diagonal angle.

256
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
You're walking diagonally from the left

257
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,039
side of the street to the right. You

258
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,279
were on the right. Correct. When we were

259
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,959
inside when we were on the outside lane,

260
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,399
correct? Therefore, you need to get in

261
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,399
room this way. No. Yes. So, it's like

262
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
this. So, when we were in the middle of

263
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,399
the street, the dead center, walking

264
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
diagonally at the parked car, say the

265
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
parked car's over here at the

266
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,480
microphone, right? If we were walking

267
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,680
diagonally at it, diagonally at it, who

268
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,399
had plenty of time to move out of the

269
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,240
way, me or Chris? Nick wanted me to slow

270
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,160
down and let him go first instead of

271
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,120
giving me enough room to walk together

272
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
down the street.

273
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,959
We're crossing the street. Am I wrong or

274
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
am I right?

275
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,800
We were cross You're wrong. We were

276
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,720
crossing the street to the right. If

277
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
we're crossing a street this way, right,

278
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Nick's like,

279
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm on the left side and you're on the

280
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,360
right side and this is all open. This is

281
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,920
all open street before we go.

282
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
Let's go to our garage and recreate this

283
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,120
right now.

284
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,680
I will too. This is the thing. We were

285
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,519
walking this way diagonal across the

286
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,880
street. So, when we're in the middle of

287
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,600
the street, which was like right here,

288
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,959
come here. And you're right here. If the

289
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,680
parked car is on my right,

290
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
right, which you say it is. Right now,

291
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,399
Right now, we're in the middle of the

292
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,680
street. Wrong.

293
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,279
Right now, we were in the middle of the

294
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,120
street when we were walking over. How

295
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,720
about this? We're walking toward that

296
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,040
parked car. I'll keep going this way.

297
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,200
How about you take four steps away from

298
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,480
me and back?

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
So, when I walk, I'm going steps behind

300
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,279
my back.

301
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,800
Sure. If that's what it takes, then

302
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,560
that's what it takes. This was the

303
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,080
This is it. I'm walking like this and

304
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,399
you're right here. So, I get to the

305
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,399
porch car. I'm like, "Oh my god, get

306
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
away from me." Where it's like if we're

307
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,040
in the middle, if this is the middle of

308
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
the street

309
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
and we already started over here. We

310
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,360
started on this point of Tell me this.

311
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,399
Tell me this. If your goal is to get to

312
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
the camera right now and you start right

313
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,839
here

314
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,839
and I'm here and you're here,

315
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,519
y

316
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,880
listen. Take a look. Look at where we

317
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,480
already are. This is where we're

318
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,240
starting from. If we walk to right here

319
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
and our goal is to get to the camera,

320
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
who right now

321
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
can go in a new direction?

322
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
Me or you?

323
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,360
Listen. No,

324
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,880
you. You can take the step this way out

325
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,440
of my space. And I'm here. I If I go

326
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,920
this way, I'm headed back to where it's

327
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
easily fitting by. This was what what

328
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,440
happened. I'm trying to get by the park

329
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
and he goes like this and like cuts me

330
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
off. So I deliberately go like this and

331
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
I push him. Story is not adding up.

332
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
Story's not adding up.

333
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,200
This is Nick. This is Nick walking

334
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,680
slightly ahead of me.

335
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
Fast.

336
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,000
This is me walking. I'm probably at this

337
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,519
pace right behind Nick cuz we're also

338
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,680
walking diagonal. So, we have to be

339
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,320
angled. There is no parked vehicle here.

340
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm about to pass the car right here

341
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,000
thinking I'm free. No. Nick cuts across

342
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,399
like that and cuts me off to the point

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
where I have to push him forward to be

344
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,880
like, "Yo, it was either I fall back

345
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,079
onto this parked vehicle right here or

346
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,920
push Nick into a open road to then

347
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,240
squeeze by so I don't fall back." And

348
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,240
that is exactly

349
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,160
you're here on my ass. So it's like go

350
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,800
if this car is coming at you and this is

351
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,800
where we need to be, cross this way. Be

352
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
your own person. I'm accounting. Be your

353
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
own adult.

354
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
Accounting for our destination being

355
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
here.

356
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,880
The crossing is coming in front of this

357
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880
car cuz I can't walk through it cuz I'm

358
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
not Casper the friendly [Â __Â ] ghost.

359
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,560
And I'm also thinking I have a normal

360
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,760
person walking with me. Like I don't

361
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,440
think you understand. You were

362
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,800
completely in the wrong. We have to find

363
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
a street and do this on a street.

364
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,760
Yes, we do. You pinned me against this

365
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,120
car.

366
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Liar. Liar. Liar. Cuz look, by the time

367
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,279
we got to the car, you had you had 20 ft

368
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
of when we were at the dead center of

369
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
the

370
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
These were my three options. And let me

371
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,560
and tell me if I'm right. Go ahead.

372
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
Do I

373
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,680
can I sit this video out?

374
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320
No. This is all I have to say.

375
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,240
These are my three options. Pause and

376
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,480
wait 5 seconds while you proceed and

377
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,959
then I follow belong behind my brother.

378
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,639
Yes.

379
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,200
Is that option one?

380
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,040
Well,

381
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,480
yes. Just say yes and that's it.

382
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,720
Next. Next. Next. Next. It's not opt

383
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,240
no. Let me list all three then you tell

384
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,360
me. Option two was if you are crossing a

385
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,800
street with a person left to right, left

386
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
side of the street to the right side of

387
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,839
the street and the person on the left

388
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,079
has gained no ter gained new no new

389
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
territory. You have more room to

390
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,279
explore.

391
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay, listen.

392
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,959
I got out of Chris's way. The last thing

393
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,320
I got out of your way. I am backtracking

394
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,680
in my space. That thing's going on to

395
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,200
me. To me, I'm like, why don't you cover

396
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,200
more ground?

397
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,839
You cover more ground. Get out of my

398
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360
way. The last enough.

399
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,240
No, you listen to me. The last thing

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,600
that I'll say.

401
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
You listen. The last thing that I'll

402
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,720
say.

403
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,959
What have I been doing?

404
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
The last 20 minutes.

405
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,200
The last thing. The last thing. Let's

406
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,600
hear it.

407
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,600
There was a parked car to my right. Nick

408
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,360
immediately to my left. And then like

409
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
eight more feet of room to Nick's left.

410
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
So you tell me who's in the wrong.

411
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
Old old space. That's it. That's all I'm

412
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,040
gonna say.

413
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,440
Old space. Yes.

414
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,480
There is room to I'll be the first to

415
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,760
admit there's room to my left. But why

416
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,680
why should I prove it to Why should I

417
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,600
walk? The only thing to my right is a

418
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,000
parked vehicle. The only thing to my

419
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,920
left is a nick. You wedged yourself

420
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
there. Toast doesn't get blamed for

421
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,079
going in the toaster. You know what I

422
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,320
mean? You put the toast in that position

423
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,880
where in this story, in this story,

424
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,040
you're the toast. I'm creating Can I

425
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,440
talk? I'm creating a space too thin

426
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,040
enough for you to get by. Can I talk?

427
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,959
Get out of the way. I will say

428
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,040
no. Hold on. And I'm disregarding the

429
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,880
entire conversation just had. I will say

430
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,120
every time I'm walking with Chris, I'm

431
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,639
like, "Okay, I'm walking with my friend

432
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
and we're out and about and we're having

433
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,240
fun."

434
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,959
There's times where I'm walking with

435
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,360
Nick where he's either 15 feet in front

436
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,320
of me 15 feet to my right.

437
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Unpredictable.

438
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
Yes.

439
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,000
Also, and then also when we get to our

440
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,959
destination, I will go to look down at

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,120
my feet and I will see a boot on top of

442
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,000
one of my feet and he doesn't even

443
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,680
realize he's standing on my own. I have

444
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,800
so much room. If we're going to the

445
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,399
right,

446
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll pull up our diagram for [Â __Â ]

447
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,560
sake. If we're going that way, right,

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,560
what I was saying,

449
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm really conf confused. All of the

450
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
blacked out space is places we haven't

451
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,560
walked yet that Chris could have chose

452
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,680
to go. You know what I mean? So, it's

453
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,920
like to me, I'm looking at this, I'm

454
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,120
like, yeah. Yeah. I don't create like a

455
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,519
divide in the earth to like unwalkable

456
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,639
territory. So, it's like for you to turn

457
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,120
this path I was walking on into like no

458
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,240
man's land cannot cross. Sure. Like I

459
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,839
might have made it difficult for you to

460
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
cross

461
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,560
trying to cross. Get out of the [Â __Â ]

462
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,399
way. But I'm already stumbling over you.

463
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,639
It's It's like I didn't want to walk

464
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,440
past the parked vehicle

465
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,040
and that's for you to decide. I The

466
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,959
Earth provid If I didn't provide you

467
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,279
with room, the Earth did. On the same

468
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,959
token, Nick, all that all that blank

469
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
white space is room you could have

470
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
fulfilled.

471
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,720
Yes, but that's farther from our

472
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,320
destination.

473
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,600
Our destination's here. We're both

474
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,959
crossing the street.

475
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,199
Yeah, I'm going the quickest path.

476
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,639
I'm going the fastest path. Maybe you

477
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,040
should think about that poor couple in

478
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,519
Japan that you were stomping behind.

479
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
They were in the way. Do you not

480
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,480
understand this, guys? I don't know. I

481
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,560
guess I just move with too much urgency.

482
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,480
I should carry a siren with me. But it

483
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,199
drives me crazy.

484
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,320
to be walking. If I'm casting a shadow

485
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,480
behind you, how about you understand I

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
can't get around you? Move.

487
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
That made zero sense.

488
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,199
Move.

489
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,680
Okay, next.

490
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,160
Move.

491
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
Next.

492
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Why do I forget everything?

493
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
Oh my god.

494
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,880
Tell them.

495
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,759
Oh my god. We went into an antique store

496
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,320
and there was a um a vintage cap gun. If

497
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,839
you are a

498
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,120
younger person and you don't know what a

499
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,040
cap gun is, which is crazy.

500
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,440
Don't want to even explain it, but a cap

501
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,000
gun is basically like it was a toy gun

502
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,839
made out of like plastic that if you

503
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,279
shot there was like a little cap in it

504
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
that made like a pop. Like you know

505
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,839
those little things you throw on the

506
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,639
ground, they make like a firework sound

507
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,079
and they pop.

508
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,360
It's like a gun and it like doesn't

509
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
shoot anything. There's no bullet.

510
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,600
There's no bullet. There's no trigger.

511
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,079
It just makes a loud sound. We found a

512
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,679
vintage one that had caps in it. I

513
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,919
didn't know it had caps in it and it

514
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,600
looked like a real gun. like it wasn't

515
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
made of plastic because it was so old

516
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,199
that it was like such good quality. It

517
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,079
was probably like all kids. They're all

518
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,439
bright and colorful green. This one's

519
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,240
literally like it looked like I was

520
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,960
holding a revolver. And so I see it and

521
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,240
me joking around. I pick it up and hold

522
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,880
it to my head and I pull the trigger and

523
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,600
the cap went off and granted like we

524
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,600
said, nothing comes out of a cap gun. It

525
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,080
made the loudest echo of boom I've ever

526
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
heard. It was like a

527
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
No, that was more of like a light of let

528
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,400
out of air. It was like a boom.

529
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Yeah. Boom. All in one moment.

530
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,880
And I'm standing No, it echoes through

531
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,880
the store. I'm like

532
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,720
looking to see like I'm like, "Oh my

533
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,720
god." Like I I I I for split second

534
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,600
genuinely thought I'm like, "Oh my god,

535
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,559
I'm I have to be dad." You mean the

536
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,039
loudest. I

537
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,480
I let go. I kind of just like hand it to

538
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,720
Mac. to me like it like possessed me

539
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,360
with

540
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,120
and you said and I I go to put it back

541
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,760
down where Nick picked it up and there's

542
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,360
a piece of paper under it that says um

543
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,919
1960s cap guns with caps inside with an

544
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
exclamation.

545
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,080
I handed it to M. I had to walk away cuz

546
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,039
well the minute I realized I was alive I

547
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,880
was like I'm embarrassed.

548
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,480
And the whole store like echoed and

549
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
everyone was probably curious to what

550
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,200
happened.

551
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,600
Yeah. It was really [Â __Â ] funny

552
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,919
though.

553
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,320
Yeah.

554
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,080
Like I just couldn't believe um I I did

555
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,280
that. I and I would never usually like

556
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,360
joke like that. You know what I mean?

557
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
It's not usually like No, like I don't

558
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
like touch things out of place. Like if

559
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
I go into an antique store, I don't want

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
to touch things I'm not going to buy. So

561
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,120
for me to possess like take the gun and

562
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
like

563
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
what was I doing?

564
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,280
I don't know, dude.

565
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,360
So [Â __Â ] funny though. I don't know

566
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
about you guys, but I've been like roguy

567
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,080
like I don't know what's up with my

568
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,840
brain if it's developing in new ways,

569
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,360
but

570
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,720
get it all out first. I have been waking

571
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
up with intrusive thoughts like and it's

572
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
not even intrusive thoughts like you

573
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,280
know like when people like oh like his

574
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,880
intrusive thoughts won and it's like you

575
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,400
hit someone or something or like you

576
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
like what is like when you're intrusive

577
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
thoughts win like you say something

578
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,679
you're like not supposed to and you like

579
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,480
give me like that's what it is

580
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,760
like what is it like if like if like if

581
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,200
like there was like a really attractive

582
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
girl walking by and I was like oh [Â __Â ]

583
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
like damn like super loud and she heard

584
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,600
it I'd be like oh my intrusive thoughts

585
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,559
like Nick an intrusive thought is is

586
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,160
shooting yourself with a cap gun store.

587
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,400
So, like I've been waking up with

588
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,440
insanely intrusive thoughts of just like

589
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,520
like bizarre like nouns like a person,

590
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,760
place, or thing. And it's not like I

591
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,960
need to be there. It's not necessarily

592
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,039
like a a craving or a need. It's just

593
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,760
like a concern. Like in my brain, I'm

594
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,640
like, "Oh, how's that?" And the other

595
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,720
day it was the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

596
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah. Like specifically, more

597
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
specifically, like the outside water

598
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,880
show like I was just I woke up and it

599
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,600
was just like the Bellagio water show.

600
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
Like it was the first thought in my

601
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,080
brain.

602
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,919
And you were what about it though?

603
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
Nothing. Nothing about it. Nothing. Like

604
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
it wasn't even like a craving of like

605
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,000
wanting to be there. It was just like

606
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,360
out of breath. It was like it wasn't

607
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,039
even a craving of like wanting to be

608
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,120
there. It was just like my consciousness

609
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,360
was like Bellagio. And I was like, "Yep,

610
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,320
then it's like it's there." It was like

611
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,480
in

612
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,720
so weird. And then

613
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,039
I've only had it was strawberry wafers.

614
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,280
Wow.

615
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,799
I woke up. I was like, I need to eat

616
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,480
strawberry wafers today. And I did. And

617
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,120
it was exactly what I wanted the minute

618
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
I woke up.

619
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,799
The only other time that I've genuinely

620
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,320
had an experience similar was Jordan's

621
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,880
furniture. Like really?

622
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,200
Yeah. Like specifically the one with

623
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
like Wall-E the green the the green

624
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,080
monster that like

625
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,640
holds the glove like this.

626
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,640
Uhhuh. I'm familiar. I that's the exact

627
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,400
like I I've I've literally like woke up

628
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
and like felt the jelly bean floor. You

629
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
want to know what's crazy? Go ahead.

630
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,360
There's a water show there. This isn't

631
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,320
just my social anxiety speaking.

632
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,320
Shopping in person has to be one of the

633
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,840
worst experiences ever. I could

634
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,280
literally have like $1,000 in my pocket

635
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,440
knowing I'm going to buy something and

636
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,559
I'm still scared to like enter a store

637
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,240
even if I

638
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,400
Well, no. I'm just talking with like

639
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,679
100% confidence. I want something. I'm

640
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
going to buy it.

641
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,159
scared to go in two stores the other

642
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,559
day. The pants that I wanted not in

643
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
stock or not in stock in my size. So I

644
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,159
look at the pants. I'm like, "Hey, can I

645
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,480
get these? Sorry, don't have them."

646
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,400
Great. Go to the shoe store. Can I get

647
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,440
these? Sorry, don't have them in your

648
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,320
size. Go online. Both of the items are

649
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,919
there and I could buy them right away.

650
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Yeah, online shopping is really great if

651
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,760
you like know your sizes.

652
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,280
It is. But like it's just stupid. I just

653
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,880
I get it's their whole job, but stop

654
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,520
trying to sell me stuff when I go in a

655
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
store.

656
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
No, literally most of the time I know

657
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
what I want. Like don't you don't got to

658
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,320
sell me on it.

659
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,960
Yeah,

660
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
it probably works.

661
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,520
Have you ever been persuaded by like a

662
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
worker?

663
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,480
I definitely have. I've definitely How

664
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,919
do you feel about the people in the mall

665
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,120
that are like fragrance or or or um

666
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,799
let me shine your shoes. Let me

667
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,480
We all know about how I feel about when

668
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,320
someone's interrupting my point A to

669
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
point B.

670
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
That's a good way to like talk about

671
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,799
like my my travel or my walk.

672
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
Yeah. You're interrupting my point A to

673
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,320
point B.

674
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,799
I love it.

675
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,440
Do you like

676
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,720
I really like it.

677
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,039
Do you like it more than that strawberry

678
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,480
wafer?

679
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,400
Depends. It's like two different things.

680
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
Can you put outgoing mail in your own

681
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,960
mailbox or No, it has to be like an

682
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,840
outgoing mailbox. But what's the whole

683
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,200
thing for the flipper? The flipper

684
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,000
switcher. The big flipper on the mail.

685
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,760
I even know

686
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
the red flipper on the mailbox. Isn't

687
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,880
that for like, hey, I have mail going

688
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,720
out.

689
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,440
I've never had one of those mailboxes in

690
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,960
either of you.

691
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I know, but isn't that the whole point?

692
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,840
Um, I just want to share, we share a lot

693
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,280
of our life with social media, and I

694
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,760
just want to share a little bit of

695
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,760
insight of what it's like to be Nick's

696
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,440
brother outside of the world of the

697
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,799
internet.

698
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,200
If he has something in his mind like

699
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,880
Terramisu,

700
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,679
you're not going to stop hearing about

701
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,640
it until

702
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,200
all the terramisu in a 60-mi radius has

703
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,840
been bought and eaten. Nick, would you

704
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,000
like to tell them about your um

705
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,720
your Terramisu?

706
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,080
What was it?

707
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
You've got the whole wrong dessert,

708
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,679
brother.

709
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
Do I?

710
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
Yes.

711
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,520
My bad, dude. I just didn't correct you

712
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,640
cuz I'm like I [Â __Â ] with tamasu. I would

713
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,919
be I thought if you were going to

714
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
surprise me with something I would have

715
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,240
been happy with either.

716
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
No, you know,

717
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,240
tell them tell me what your creme brule

718
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,640
tell me the difference between tiramisu

719
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,280
and creme brulee. Like I want to know

720
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,000
every little

721
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,799
creme brulee is like

722
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,799
a it's less high off of the plate where

723
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,240
like a tiramisu is usually like a cake.

724
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,720
So, it's like there's like it's like

725
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,039
higher up where creme brulee has to be

726
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,080
like part of the creme brulee is I

727
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,440
honestly don't really know what's in

728
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,120
there, but the top gets torched on fire

729
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
so that like the sugar coating on the

730
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,799
top kind of like burns. So, it's like

731
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,240
you have to do that to the whole creme

732
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,120
brulee. So, creme brules are usually

733
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,960
flatter.

734
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
Got it.

735
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,159
It's like what's the flavor? What's the

736
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,760
flavor of it? I don't know what the

737
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,200
flavor of a creme brulee is, but I know

738
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,640
that the flavor of a tiramisu is like

739
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,640
it's like coffee cake, but it's not like

740
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
coffee cake like cinnamon roll coffee

741
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,360
cake. It's like coffee cake like coffee

742
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,880
ice cream

743
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,120
with like coffee in it.

744
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
Wow. What's the most nostalgic thing you

745
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
can think of like off the top of your

746
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
head?

747
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,600
Uh a DVD like a thing where you just pop

748
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,200
it open, you got the DVD.

749
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,880
Good one. Yeah.

750
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,440
I think the smell of pine.

751
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
I think grass in overall is a big one

752
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
for me.

753
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
Really?

754
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,520
Yes.

755
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,320
Just grass. like long real grass. Not

756
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,960
turf.

757
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,559
Not turf. Okay. But like dirt in between

758
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,520
your toes.

759
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
Like you know when you're a kid and

760
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
you're kind of like playing and you're

761
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,880
like running around or you're going to

762
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,960
get picked up or you're getting dragged

763
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
and you're just like your feet are just

764
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
so dirty.

765
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,159
Grass burn type of vibe.

766
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,840
Like kind of more of like I'm thinking

767
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
like when you're on when you're on a

768
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
swing when you're on a swing that's

769
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,559
above dirt and you're trying to stop

770
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,000
yourself cuz no one's near you. So you

771
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
have to like drag your feet through the

772
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,200
Oh my god. Should I tell them about mud

773
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,600
blasting?

774
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Remember Mud Blasters?

775
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,440
I know. Do you remember that?

776
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,880
There was this thing we did in school

777
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,919
where you had to have like a team name

778
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
for your classroom.

779
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,720
I feel like you're starting at the

780
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,640
finish line here. No, I'm not.

781
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Yes, you are. You describe it then.

782
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,679
When we were kids, Chris used to go to

783
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,840
the beach and get wet sand and throw it

784
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,679
at people and say he was mud blasting.

785
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,000
That's the divergent though. That's the

786
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,760
lie.

787
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,120
That's that that's what makes the story

788
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,760
funny. Oh. Oh. Mud blasting and like I

789
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,600
can't even say it.

790
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,240
Mud blasting like taking a [Â __Â ]

791
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,679
It was just like

792
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,120
there was like a competition thing, but

793
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,960
it was like each home room had to come

794
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,240
up with their own name, but it had to

795
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
coexist with the teacher's name.

796
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,520
Like it had Yeah. It had to be like an

797
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,960
alliteration. So Chris, because our

798
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,279
teacher's name was Miss B, it was Miss

799
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,279
Be's mud blasters.

800
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,400
Yeah. and he ditched it to the class and

801
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,159
the teacher was like the teacher like

802
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,840
that's a little inappropriate so like

803
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,360
that's a lot and he was like no it just

804
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,279
reminds me of like a childhood memory of

805
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,600
when I used to mud blast at the beach

806
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
and I like lied and said mud blasting

807
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,960
was like throwing sand at my brothers

808
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,840
when in reality it was like taking a

809
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,159
[Â __Â ]

810
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,320
and our team name was almost they came

811
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,640
in second place the mis mud blasters

812
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,880
misbe mud blasters

813
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,880
all I wanted was you

814
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,600
my favorite saying.

815
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,520
Do you Are you going to try to guess?

816
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,919
I have no [Â __Â ] idea what you're

817
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
talking about.

818
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,200
Neither do I.

819
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,640
What is your favorite saying?

820
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,159
If you're praying for the rain, you

821
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
better be ready for the mud.

822
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
I've never heard you say that before.

823
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
What? I've said it to your face in a

824
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,039
video.

825
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
Really?

826
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,320
Yes. Like they're going to clip the old

827
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,320
time I said it and be like, "Yeah,

828
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,919
if you're praying for the rain, you

829
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,120
better be ready for the mud cuz that's

830
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,559
what comes with the rain." It's like a

831
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,360
It's like a metaphor. I get the

832
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,720
metaphor.

833
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,159
Okay.

834
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,279
Well, don't act don't say it like you

835
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,679
don't like don't say it like you

836
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,520
question.

837
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,559
I fully understand.

838
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,600
You want to know mine?

839
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,520
Be careful with those things,

840
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,279
bro. How lit was it when we were kids

841
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,200
like drinking tea with the little bowl

842
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,880
underneath the saucer fire

843
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
and then you like dump the tea in it.

844
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,720
You

845
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,919
I swear to God our grandmother thought

846
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,440
she was like British or something.

847
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
No, we used to have crazy tea parties

848
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
with Graham.

849
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,840
We did crazy. Like it was almost like we

850
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,840
were drinking tea just for the [Â __Â ] of

851
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,120
it. I think for one time we had a

852
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
stuffed animal like pulled up to the

853
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
table too. Like

854
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
of course

855
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,159
like it was legit.

856
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,840
Of course. So legendary actually.

857
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,960
Wish I bought more milk at the grocery

858
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
store today.

859
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,080
I've been Another one. Not necessarily

860
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,200
something I've been craving when I've

861
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,159
been waking up, but something I've

862
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,880
needed in my life.

863
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,679
Lucky Charms.

864
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,640
Lucky Charms.

865
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,679
Sing it. Sing it.

866
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,720
Um hearts, stars, and hearts, stars. No.

867
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,320
Hearts, stars, and clovers. Horseshoes

868
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,720
and balloons.

869
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,960
Hourglass.

870
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,039
Hearts.

871
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,200
Is he going to get the box? That's the

872
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,520
thing though. I I used to think as a kid

873
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,000
like, "Wow, I would love a box of Lucky

874
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Charms that's all marshmallows." I kind

875
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,200
of like the the kick is something else,

876
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
you know?

877
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,960
No, Nick's running over.

878
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,799
Matt, I can't believe you said that cuz

879
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,360
I was eating Lucky Charms earlier.

880
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,200
You're You read my mind. I was thinking

881
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,880
like I my phone died. So, of course,

882
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
when my phone died, I'm like, "Let me go

883
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,080
plug it in downstairs." I spent like an

884
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
hour off my phone and I'm eating the

885
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,760
cereal and I'm thinking to myself while

886
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,159
I'm eating the Lucky Charms, I'm like,

887
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,200
whoever is in the [Â __Â ] ratio

888
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,679
department at Lucky Charms headquarters

889
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,679
raise cuz I'm getting a scoop and it's

890
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:56,640
like the to the tea. This is the biggest

891
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,960
perfect ratio every single time. Giant

892
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
size.

893
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,679
Every single time. Oh my god. Where's

894
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,320
the slogan?

895
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,279
Where's the slogan? Like they don't have

896
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,760
it printed on every box. It was on the

897
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,600
last one.

898
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,640
The plastic took care.

899
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,559
Hearts, stars, and mushrooms.

900
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,880
There's no more mushrooms.

901
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,919
Hearts, stars, and horseshoes. Clovers

902
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,240
and balloons. Hourglasses, rainbows, and

903
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,559
tasty red balloons. But they got rid of

904

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,520
You just said balloons twice.

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,399
They got rid of the hourglass.

907
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
You said balloon twice.

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,559
balloons.

915
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,760
