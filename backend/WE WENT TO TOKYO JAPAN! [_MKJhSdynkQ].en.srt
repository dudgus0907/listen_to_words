1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,520
Don't talk about English.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,679
What's up everyone? We are now in

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,120
louder. What? What's up guys? We're in

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,160
Japan.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,559
Just come look at this vending machine.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,519
FC refresh shot.

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,240
Chris, you got to get it.

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,000
What do you think that like tastes like?

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,960
110 yen. Can I

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
look at these kids beggars?

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,039
Look at you. Like

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,279
Nick, come on.

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
Say, "Daddy, please." No. Yeah.

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,119
This is like genuinely my mind and

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
Chris's first trip of our entire life

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,840
that it's just the three of us here.

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,680
Like genuinely just the three of us. So

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
really crazy. We were just eating. We

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
were just eating and talking about how

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,800
unbelievable it is that we're here.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
We never thought we would ever come

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
here.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,800
Especially by at 21 and just us three.

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
Yeah. Crazy.

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,160
22 in a month. But welcome to the vlog.

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,079
Gorgeous. Oh, it smells like Pepsi,

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
I would imagine. Figured. Is it

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,760
delicious or no? Yeah,

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
it's like Pepsi but a little more zing.

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,399
Pepsi Zing.

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,320
Hey guys.

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
Hello guys. Chris got Chris Chris got

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,560
really dizzy and lightheaded so he went

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,920
back to the hotel

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
and he's being a baby just in general.

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
It's really hot. So I guess it's hot.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,960
It's hot in Japan.

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,960
Me and Nick are starting his vlog. I'm a

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,040
big fan of apple drinks. And look at

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,439
irresistible is crazy. So we're going to

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,360
try this smiley face apple juice.

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,439
Look at the cap.

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
Cute. Okay. Okay, you ready?

44
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,320
Cheers.

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759
Cheers.

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,119
I like how it just like looks so like

47
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,200
like you could like just drink this.

48
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,200
Like it just looks so susceptible to the

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
drinking.

50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,840
Matt, I watched the click in your head.

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
As an apple fan, you've got to be losing

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
your mind now.

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
No, this is really good. It tastes like

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,680
apple juice for babies, and I kind of

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,119
[ __ ] with that. Apple juice for babies.

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
Oh, it's kind of delicious.

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,560
Does it not give you like a baby vibe?

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
Like a 2-year-old would [ __ ] with this.

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
Heavy.

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
It probably is for babies.

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
Mhm.

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
I like it. I' I'd get it again.

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,479
Mhm.

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
And Nick, you look like you lost another

65
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,920
20 lb.

66
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,879
Really?

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,759
Yes.

68
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,200
It's just being down.

69
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,920
I think it's the shirt, too. Flex on

70
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,319
them real quick.

71
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,959
No.

72
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,360
Why?

73
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,200
No.

74
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
You just look built. Like you look

75
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm not built.

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,200
You do. You look like a mammoth next to

77
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,920
me. Like you look like in a good way.

78
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
Like strong. This is strong.

79
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,319
You're freaking me out.

80
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,520
Take a picture. Smile.

81
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm really worried for

82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,440
Good morning. Day number two in Japan.

83
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,160
On our way to breakfast. Chris is still

84
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,160
feeling dizzy.

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
Welcome back to the Stern of the

86
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,720
Triplets vlog. Matt and Chris are eating

87
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,000
French toast.

88
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,519
How are we supposed to do anything when

89
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
it's this hot?

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,200
It's a good question. But you're

91
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,360
prevailing and you're doing an amazing

92
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,360
job despite what your haircut says about

93
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,360
you.

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Get

95
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Oh my god. That was good.

96
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm trying to keep I'm trying to make

97
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,920
sure we get a good vlog. I'm having a

98
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
fun time. I have to pick up the energy

99
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
cuz Chris is hot and he's normally our

100
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
maniac. You know what I mean?

101
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
I know.

102
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,200
He's normally our our maniac.

103
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
It all happened. What are you vlogging

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
in that orientation for?

105
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,720
What?

106
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
You just spun the camera toward me and

107
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
you're we're in a square shape.

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,800
Dude, put your phone away.

109
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,280
You have to blur that.

110
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,760
Why are we in a square shape right now?

111
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
It's um it's 5X.

112
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
It's retro.

113
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,200
I don't know.

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
Sorry about that orientation, guys. I

115
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,080
Oh my god,

116
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,560
I can't believe

117
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
I started recording from a photo format.

118
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,519
They hate to see an American feeling a

119
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
beat in Japan.

120
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,599
Burger today, burger tomorrow, burger

121
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,640
forever. Like, I kind of need that

122
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,040
written across my chest in bold black

123
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
ink.

124
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
It says play games and I saw

125
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,720
play games.

126
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
I saw a bunch of skill cranes last night

127
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
and I'm going to win one of them. Let's

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
[ __ ] go.

129
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
Yes,

130
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
I'm so excited.

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,000
I hate that guy.

132
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,879
That evil thunk from Toy Story.

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,799
No, I hate him. He's like evil. I think

134
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,519
he turned on Woody and the homies. I'd

135
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,959
turn on Woody. Of course you would. Give

136
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
me more.

137
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
A little Care Bear. Mom loves Care

138
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,840
Bears.

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,400
You give me more.

140
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
Wait, wait, wait.

141
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
Can I have some?

142
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Nick. Nice.

143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
Nick.

144
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Nick. Oh my god.

145
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,840
I'll get a first try. You'll be

146
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Chris. Chris.

147
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,800
Oh my god. That's so close.

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,680
That was a good grab.

149
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,680
I don't even think it's getable.

150
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,440
You win. That's a win, right?

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,440
You got that.

152
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,800
That's never losing.

153
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,479
Oh my.

154
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
That might be ideal. It's got like a

155
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
tilt to it.

156
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,199
Wait. Drop another. Drop another. You

157
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
got to drop another on there.

158
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
Just hit the machine.

159
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,800
Chris, no. Chris, no.

160
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,199
I just won this and Matt doesn't know.

161
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,199
Where is he?

162
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,840
Look at this thing.

163
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
That's crazy.

164
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,000
No. That's so cute.

165
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
Isn't it unreal?

166
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,520
How did you get that?

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No looker.

168
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,880
A no looker.

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,919
You got it, Matt.

170
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,919
No. Don't Don't say [ __ ]

171
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
No.

172
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
See the cat poster above you?

173
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,000
The cat poster above me?

174
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,919
No, I don't know what's there.

175
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
He's like looking into outer space. It's

176
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
amazing.

177
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
Do you know what you're going to get?

178
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Nope. Cuz you're been you've been

179
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,639
holding the menu for a whole gone. What

180
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,680
did I just say?

181
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,840
I'm going to get a Wagu burger,

182
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,440
fried onions, bacon jam, and cheddar

183
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,880
cheese, but no bacon. You want to know

184
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,880
why it's bacon jam and not bacon jelly?

185
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
I wish I could I'm so hungry. I could

186
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,360
eat Kirby right now.

187
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Nick, don't say that about him.

188
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,039
Woo! I can't wait to eat.

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
One fried Kirby.

190
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,560
He just doesn't know it yet.

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,639
He's sick to his stomach. Chris, no.

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,479
Don't even play. Don't even play. Can

193
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,479
you put him back, Matt?

194
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,479
OMG.

195
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,639
dancing at the movies cuz it feels so

196
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,319
mystical.

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
I love your hair, Nick, and I love your

198
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
hat.

199
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
Thank you. I appreciate the comments.

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
No problem.

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
This is actually like cinematic, like

202
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
movie level, like with the skyline

203
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,000
behind you, Matt. Like, you could say

204
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
something crazy right now and it would

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,600
look intense.

206
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,600
The city is mine.

207
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,400
Let's go.

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,479
We're all getting ice cream. Yes.

209
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,479
This guy's awesome.

210
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,479
Hey,

211
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
what is he doing?

212
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,880
I don't know.

213
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,880
And just like that,

214
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
it's all gone.

215
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,479
I really am.

216
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,479
Fat, fat, fatty.

217
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,759
[Laughter]

218
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,280
I mean you

219
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,599
[ __ ]

220
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,599
Uhuh.

221
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,240
Ow. You take it too far.

222
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,240
Always takes it too far.

223
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Way later.

224
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,720
I can't see.

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,720
Don't you wish you could?

226
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,479
I have my dick out. I don't care.

227
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
Well, I'm gonna peel on the floor.

228
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,960
Is this in my room?

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,639
On the floor.

230
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,319
Oh my god.

231
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,960
Did you pee on the floor?

232
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,680
I just peed Nick. I'm peeing on the

233
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
floor.

234
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
Nick, turn it on.

235
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,720
Nick, you're cleaning.

236
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,160
No, I'm not.

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I just pissed all over the [ __ ] wall.

238
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,720
We'll see you guys later.

239
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,000
You're annoying.

240
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,560
Are you [ __ ] kidding me?

241
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
All right, guys. Me and Nick tried this

242
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,839
two days ago. Chris is going to try it

243
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
now because he's finally with us.

244
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,120
Whoa.

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,519
Give it a shot.

246
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,519
Baby juice.

247
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,399
Yeah.

248
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
It's good, right?

249
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,680
Mhm. Wouldn't like a 2-year-old like

250
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,800
[ __ ] that [ __ ] up?

251
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
Are you like messing with me?

252
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,560
You look super muscular.

253
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
Me

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
like super built. Honestly,

255
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
don't do that. Don't do that.

256
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm joking.

257
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
Who are you talking about?

258
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,160
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

259
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,320
It's a long story. I don't have time to

260
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,600
explain.

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,680
Not that funny, bro.

262
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Not that funny, bro.

263
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
What's the Yo, get out of my face.

264
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
You have to tie your shoe. I feel you

265
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
guys just had a inside joke about

266
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,680
monsters.

267
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,680
Good night.

268
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
There's glass things in there. Like I

269
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
wish you didn't just drop that.

270
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
I didn't mean to drop it, Matt.

271
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,160
Wow.

272
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,959
Hey, cheese.

273
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
Nice.

274
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,839
Hey,

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Chris, where are we going?

276
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,040
The other store.

277
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,640
Let's go. You were just at the chain.

278
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,440
Got these and now we're on the way to

279
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
the other store.

280
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,760
Dude, doesn't this feel great, Chris?

281
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,440
Yeah, it feels You feel the breeze.

282
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
That's I think this this drive is going

283
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,440
to be like comically short. Yeah, it's a

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,440
3m minute walk or one minute drive. So

285
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,160
I hope I don't drop everything I own.

286
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,120
Oh my god. Thank you.

287
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,680
Thank you. Thank you.

288
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
Thank you.

289
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
Thank you.

290
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Have a good day.

291
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,040
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

292
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,839
That was like I feel like I just burped

293
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,079
and got there.

294
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,120
Just spawned in. Let's go.

295
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,800
Hey everyone, we are trying ramen in

296
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
Japan.

297
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
The first time I've ever got in a fight

298
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
over it cuz Chris isn't sure if he's

299
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,680
going to like it.

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,519
First time I've had ramen in my life.

301
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,320
Chris is just asking for a plane and we

302
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
were ordering on his

303
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
Well, Chris is asking me. He's like,

304
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
"Nick, am I going to like it? Am I going

305
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,720
to like it?" I'm like, "Unfortunately, I

306
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,720
was born with my own mouth, so I don't

307
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,519
know what yours is going to enjoy. I

308
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,519
know what my mouth enjoys."

309
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,120
Of course you do.

310
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,600
Everything. It's hard for your mouth not

311
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,480
to enjoy something.

312
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,519
My mouth enjoys being shut.

313
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,519
We know that. I hate everyone.

314
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,720
The flash hasn't gone off once, by the

315
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,240
way. Because I haven't put the flash on.

316
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,640
The flash should always be on on those

317
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,279
types of cameras. Why? All the photos

318
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
are going to be bad.

319
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
I Nick, I literally read this. Flash on.

320
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,440
Then use

321
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
flash off this. You should always use

322
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
the flash.

323
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,640
Matt, don't listen to him. Why?

324
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,120
I'm the king. He's a hater. Fine. Here.

325
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,279
I might have been.

326
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
Is

327
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,360
that good for you? Nick, what has been

328
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,480
your favorite part of Japan so far?

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
My favorite part is probably being with

330
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,079
you and Chris.

331
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
Really?

332
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
Yeah.

333
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,320
That's not my favorite part. Chris, what

334
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
would you say your favorite part is?

335
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
The heat.

336
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,839
Can you guys stop being annoying? My

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,519
favorite part is honestly just spending

338
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
all my money irrationally.

339
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,320
Okay, that's my favorite part. Yeah.

340
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
Nick's favorite part is that everything

341
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,040
is in yen. So, you just got to swipe and

342
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,079
hope he has enough. I'm like, yen? Here

343
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,600
you go. Nasty girl.

344
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,600
Nasty girl. It's

345
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,160
a similarity to Top Ramen.

346
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Yeah, figured.

347
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,160
You're eating it.

348
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,160
H. You're eating it. I've never had Pop

349
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
Ramen.

350
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,440
[Music]

351
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,639
Are you an idiot? I'm dead serious.

352
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Lying to my face in Japan. Okay. Lying

353
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,839
to my face in Japan. It's all I high

354
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
school. All I ate every day for 10

355
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,120
years.

356
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
I literally wouldn't even know how to

357
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
make it. Like, I'd have to read the

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,200
directions.

359
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,200
You're insane.

360
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,000
Stop laughing like that.

361
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
I just recorded you for a minute without

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,120
you knowing just to show you like what

363
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,880
you move like.

364
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
I'd probably be really upset.

365
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,800
I want to go to that the ski the arcade

366
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
and try to win.

367
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,399
What are you saying? the unexpected

368
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
moments that make things memorable,

369
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,959
right?

370
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,720
Yeah, exactly. Um, yeah. Um, well, that

371
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
sounds good. I'll talk to you later, I

372
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
guess.

373
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,720
Absolutely. It was great chatting with

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
you and if you need anything else, just

375
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
let me know. Have a great one.

376
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,639
Thank you. I appreciate it.

377
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
You're very welcome. Take care and have

378
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,720
a great rest of your day.

379
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,279
You were blushing. No,

380
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,079
I wasn't.

381
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
Yes, you were.

382
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,880
He said something super funny.

383
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,160
You were blushing.

384
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
Imagine if that's how someone looked

385
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,240
through a curtain like, "Oh, what? Let

386
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,079
me see how it's

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
sick." And then like clapped it like

388
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,760
that. You're sick. New curtain method

389
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,880
unlocked. This is how this is how we're

390
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,880
looking through curtains all of 2026.

391
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,279
You're going to break it. It's honestly

392
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,760
very like easy. Like no more lugging

393
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,800
around with the nifty string.

394
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,000
Wow. Shark Tank vocab instantly. No more

395
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,880
lugging around with a shifty spring.

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
Nifty spring.

397
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,480
Nifty string.

398
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
I kind of like this a lot more cuz you

399
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
don't have to like hold the current.

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,000
No, but it's for a quick peak rather

401
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
than being like like you know how some

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,120
people are like, "Oh,

403
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
it's a hassle to be yanking on these

404
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
tangled."

405
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
Yes, Nick. You get it. It's like, "Oh, I

406
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,839
want to see outside." Like, that looks

407
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,639
like creepy. This it eliminates the

408
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,480
creep. It's more of just like, "Oh,

409
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,160
yeah, that's outside."

410
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
Yeah, but now you're like wrinkling

411
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,880
though. No, it's not wrinkled at all.

556
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
bunch of different food challenges on

557
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
our channel, but this time we're going

558
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,320
to do it and actually get the stuff from

559
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,760
where cuz we normally we did a video

560
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
trying Japanese snacks. They were all

561
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
bad. They were all bad and I don't think

562
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,120
any of them are authentic. But we're

563
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,720
here. We're in the place and we're going

564
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,720
to buy a bunch. So, let's go. Let's go.

565
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Ham.

566
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
This one looks the most fun to me.

567
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,640
This is Baskin Robin strawberry

568
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
cheesecake. Okay.

569
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
Girl love me cuz she say she want my

570
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
baby. Baby baby.

571
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,760
Not even close to the lyrics.

572
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Is it not?

573
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,600
Wo.

574
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,600
These mentos I bought last night because

575
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,799
I really [ __ ] with them. And then Nick

576
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
reminded me that we're filming this

577
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,960
video today. So I paused and I bought

578
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
these. But we're going to try them now.

579
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,760
Let's do it. Thank god you said

580
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
really. That was like much more

581
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,160
important than

582
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,760
Well, I wanted to give proper

583
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,120
introduction but Chris just didn't.

584
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,120
Introduction is the word you're looking

585
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,120
for.

586
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480
M.

587
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,480
It's orangey goodness. I feel it like

588
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,600
feel like a mentos like burst flavor.

589
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Like I feel it like go all over me kind

590
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,840
of.

591
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
I'm not getting that. Neither am I.

592
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,200
Really?

593
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,960
Yeah. No, I'm not getting that.

594
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,520
This I'm most excited about. Look, it's

595
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,360
cotton candy, but it's pure white. Like

596
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,240
it literally looks like like a cloud.

597
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,679
Like dusty air. Take a small bite.

598
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,400
Tastes like literally nothing.

599
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
You ate it.

600
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,880
Like literally nothing. Doesn't even

601
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,640
have a scent. Ready?

602
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,480
Wow. Doesn't have a scent at all. This

603
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
is literally pointless. This is

604
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
pointless.

605
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,440
It feels like I'm eating like a pillow.

606
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Like dead ass. Very similar to like a

607
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,640
crispy cream donut.

608
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,880
Gone in a blip. I feel like I could kill

609
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,880
you with this. Like use this instead of

610
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
[ __ ]

611
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,320
I feel like I'm eating insulation.

612
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,360
All right, guys. On to uh snack number

613
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,360
three. What is this? Hi-Chew minis. Oh

614
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
my god, they're in ball form. Which one?

615
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,080
Yes.

616
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,200
Take some.

617
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,360
Way too excited about that, buddy.

618
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
Approved. Not good.

619
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Which one did you have?

620
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,039
Yellow.

621
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
Yeah.

622
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,760
Wait, I'm getting something bad. It

623
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,760
tastes a little dusty to be honest.

624
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,240
That's good. I'd hate to finish a bag of

625
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,440
these. I know. I've had so much food in

626
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,280
my life. I need to eat something I'm

627
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,120
excited about. And these are not it.

628
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,240
Why do you do that? It's just like I

629
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,120
need to get it out. I need to get it out

630
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,080
of my throat. Fourth snack.

631
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,080
Pokemon gummies.

632
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,679
Be the worst person ever.

633
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,039
Pokemon gummies. You know, it takes a

634
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,400
lot to be the worst person ever.

635
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,320
Can I see it?

636
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,440
They're mini.

637
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,240
Oh my god.

638
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
Show the camera.

639
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,760
No. The size of those are so we're going

640
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
to fall.

641
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,679
Look. Look.

642
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,919
Oh, they don't taste good.

643
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
They do. I like it.

644
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,320
They're not.

645
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
I'm a big fan of these cuz they're

646
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,200
wrong. They're so weird though.

647
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,640
They're like They're like chalky.

648
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
Those are like a mid, but they're like

649
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,520
All right.

650
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,960
They're not good.

651
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,440
Those I'd say six out of 10. Little Bob

652
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Dogs.

653
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to take a

654
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,440
picture of this. It's so cute.

655
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,039
Literally, these are probably going to

656
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,360
be gas. Open it up. Oh, I'm dizzy.

657
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,600
You okay? Drink some water. I don't need

658
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,400
three of these. Is this Is this going to

659
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,159
turn into gum? I hate [ __ ] that's gum.

660
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Mm-

661
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:11,200
Oh my god.

662
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,679
Blueberry chalk. I like it. Not a fan.

663
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,720
Oh my god. It's like really shocking me.

664
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,679
Well, yeah. You're putting your whole

665
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
neck into the bite.

666
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,400
I don't know. I This is my favorite one.

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,240
Look how cute this is, though. So out of

668
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,960
what?

669
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Oh, it's the cutest thing ever.

670
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,559
Like it tastes like Fun Dip. Lick a

671
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,200
stick to me. Like I just the work part

672
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
of Fun Dip. It's

673
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
the best part of Fun Dip and it tastes

674
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,919
nothing like that. Lick a stick. Okay.

675
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,480
Gay guy.

676
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,360
What is this?

677
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
I don't know.

678
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,400
I don't like that. This is going to be

679
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
the [ __ ] gum disaster.

680
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
Hold on. Hold on. This is going to be

681
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,080
gum. I'm It's going to be so cold.

682
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,159
Hold on. [ __ ]

683
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,919
Hold on. Chris, can you wait? This is

684
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,799
100% gum. Look at the way it's like

685
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,480
chalky.

686
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
Oh my god. This is gum.

687
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,280
This is

688
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,320
Yep. I'm chewing shitty tasting gum.

689
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,799
It's not gum.

690
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,120
[Applause]

691
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
Nick,

692
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm sorry.

693
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
I felt like

694
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,039
not good.

695
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,240
Okay. Well, are you like not that bad?

696
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
Can we move to the next, please? I have

697
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,120
to get that out of my face.

698
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,080
Okay. Me and Nick both had the pink one.

699
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,080
The pink one is not good.

700
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,240
Oh my god. That's one of the worst

701
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,640
things I've ever had in my life. All

702
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,559
right, these things might be fire.

703
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
The pretz.

704
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,200
I really like the name of them. Pretzel

705
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,520
gets the point across. Pretz

706
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,000
doesn't smell good.

707
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,320
Like a meal and like zapped into a

708
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,960
stick.

709
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
This is the best thing.

710
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
This is your type of vibe. Not

711
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,559
like a full meal zapped into one thing.

712
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,440
I hate this.

713
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,400
Oh, my favorite. It's your vibe, not

714
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,919
mine.

715
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,880
You should do the ranking here cuz I'm

716
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,360
going to give it a lower ranking than

717
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,919
you want.

718
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,159
I just love it. 10 out of 10.

719
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,640
Stick cheese. Like it's like bad cheese

720
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,840
and chicken.

721
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
You mean cheese sticks?

722
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
No, like stick cheese.

723
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
I don't like it. I know what a cheese

724
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,480
stick is. I'm not

725
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,720
When I was next.

726
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,200
Okay. I think this is like a strawberry

727
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,440
punch in the face.

728
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,640
Sounds like a great time.

729
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,760
What is it? What What are you

730
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,159
experiencing there?

731
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:20,000
I think it's cola, actually.

732
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:24,919
Like co cola fizzy right off your palm

733
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,919
ASMR. Hold on. Actually, be quiet.

734
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,640
Okay. My full mouth was over the mic.

735
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,640
Like the mic was in my mouth.

736
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,440
Imagine,

737
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,799
man.

738
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,840
Okay. Almond crush pocky.

739
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,279
Ooh, almond crush. I want that pocky or

740
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
pokey

741
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,360
party clap.

742
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Chris,

743
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
you're getting almond.

744
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,799
Chris,

745
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,200
you're getting almond on my bed.

746
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,600
Oh my god. Really good. Give me one.

747
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
Can you taste me? Give me one.

748
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
Give me one.

749
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
Put the [ __ ] thing in my throat.

750
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
Your uvula.

751
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
I don't know, man.

752
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,720
Tonsil.

753
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
Sure.

754
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,120
Either or.

755
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,240
So good.

756
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
It's the best thing so far.

757
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,000
Best thing so far.

758
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,320
Baby grind on me. Do you remember that

759
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
was a trend? I was about to say random

760
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,640
confession.

761
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,279
Jelly beans. Yeah, pretty

762
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,400
straightforward.

763
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,400
That's a pickle.

764
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,880
What? No, that's in Japanese.

765
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,880
What did he say?

766
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,679
If those were reading glasses, that

767
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,679
would have been

768
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,440
Wait, don't open them like that. Give me

769
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,000
Give it to me now.

770
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,000
Those are really good.

771
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,200
Have you guys ever [ __ ] seen Haribo

772
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,600
jelly beans? Jelly flops.

773
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,279
No, man. That's [ __ ] jelly flops. No,

774
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,919
that's [ __ ] jelly belly.

775
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,679
These are like 9-year-old me would be

776
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,440
freaking out.

777
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,400
I don't like jelly beans.

778
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,320
I never have.

779
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,919
I wish I was even remotely enjoying

780
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
anything.

781
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,520
Did you have the white one?

782
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,440
No. Eat it.

783
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,240
The white one is fantastic. It tastes

784
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,240
just like the jelly jelly bean gummy

785
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
beast.

786
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,159
I'm most excited about this. Hold on.

787
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,880
Let me show them the packaging first.

788
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:20,240
It's like wafer ice cream cones. These

789
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,919
look so I [ __ ] good.

790
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
Um there's the vanilla.

791
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,080
Vanilla. Strawberry.

792
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,559
Strawberry.

793
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
Christian, go strawberry.

794
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
Of course, I have to get the strawberry

795
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,880
one. It's

796
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,159
just cute and pink.

797
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,279
Oh, it smells so good.

798
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,120
Wait, I actually probably would like the

799
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,240
strawberry more. Oh well.

800
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,760
Wait, should we can we do like a in the

801
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,560
middle three something?

802
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,799
Dude, what?

803
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,559
[Music]

804
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,919
Why are you puffing all over me?

805
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,440
Oh my god. Can I please try the

806
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,440
strawberry one? Actually,

807
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,440
I love the strawberry ones of those. I

808
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,440
knew.

809
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,120
Oh my god. Good.

810
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,559
Oh my god. I feel like the vanilla one

811
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,080
would be the best. This reminds me when

812
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,559
I used to go I don't want this.

813
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,320
the hospital as a kid.

814
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,159
I used to get these all the time.

815
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,720
Okay, I would say second best thing

816
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,080
we've had today. My favorite. What was

817
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,760
your favorite?

818
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,679
Those almond sticks.

819
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,320
Oh, those are good. All right, guys. The

820
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,159
last thing that we are trying is this. I

821
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,200
think it's matcha. Oh, no. It's Dubai

822
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,960
chocolate. Pistachio. Dubai chocolate. I

823
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,679
think all Dubai chocolate's pistachio.

824
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,039
No, I don't [ __ ] understand this.

825
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,399
What's going on in the world? What is

826
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
Dubai chocolate? What does that even

827
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,039
mean? I don't know.

828
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,520
I don't think I want to try this. Oh, it

829
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,520
smells good. Kind of. I like pistachios.

830
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,200
I don't know if that's like a crazy

831
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,679
confession. No, it's good. I'm going to

832
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,919
literally throw up, but the consistency

833
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,799
kind of like blows.

834
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
What do you think, Nick?

835
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,039
Here's what Here me it tastes like [ __ ]

836
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,120
Here's here's what I'm going to say.

837
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,120
Here's what I'm going to say. [ __ ] It's

838
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,640
not bad, but I'd rather have a Reese's

839
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,320
cup. And I agree. You know, you know, I

840
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,000
love when Reese's makes the funny little

841
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,200
shapes like the Easter Bunny. I like

842
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,679
when they do the funny ads and it's like

843
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,919
I like when an ad commentator has like a

844
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,480
super deep voice and he's like, "You

845
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,799
want my chocolate?"

846
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,200
All right, guys. That was us trying some

847
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,039
Japanese snacks in Japan. And we will

848
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,399
see you guys next part of the vlog. I

849
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,640
don't know if this was the best idea

850
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,000
ever cuz all three of us are allergic,

851
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,440
but I know we should have done this late

852
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,799
in our day so you could take Benadryl

853
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,480
and go to bed.

854
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,480
It's worth it. If we all walk around in

855
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,520
swollen places after this, it's feel

856
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,520
like very worth it.

857
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,919
The guardian of the doorway.

858
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Wait,

859
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
he looks like a man. Like a literal

860
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,640
person.

861
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,640

Not hungry. You are though.

Yes.

867
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,559
Eat.

868
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,840
Chris, I feel like they look oddly

869
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,840
human. Like I recorded one and he was

870
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,399
like

871
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,360
staring at Chris. Hold on.

872
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,799
No. Move.

873
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:57,320
Oh. could just push me.

874
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,320
Push me in the cat cafe, by the way.

875
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,120
They're really like crazy. Like, they're

876
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,120
big and gorgeous.

877
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,159
Come on. A couple more pieces.

878
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,240
Me and Chris can't stop laughing at Matt

879
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,919
because he's so obsessed. Like, I think

880
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,679
he keeps looking at us to make sure we

881
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,960
haven't gone anywhere. But I think if he

882
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,510
could stay here for the rest of the day,

883
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,569
he would.

I don't know if he likes me or if he was

887
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,360
just being greedy.

888
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,919
Greedy little munchkin. Look at them.

So cute.

Do you guys have coins?

No, we have no coins. Matt, you've used

all Matt, are you regretting using all

893
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,720
of our coins at the skill crane or no?

Hey guys, we are headed to our favorite

902
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,159
barbecue place. We went the other day. I

903
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,640
came here when I was here last year and

904
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,880
it's delicious and amazing. And we're

905
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,200
going back and we're 2 minutes away. I

906
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,760
just have to say I've always wanted to

907
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,440
play Pokémon Go in the streets of Japan.

908
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,600
Is it living up to your expectations?

909
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,080
It's amazing. I'm having so much fun.

What are you touch on my chin for?

917
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,720
You had something on your chin. I'm not

918
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,760
touching it for fun.

919
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
You have a kind chin. You know that,

920
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,760
right?

921
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,880
You have a kind of chin. I like

922
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,880
Are you cooking like a good boy?

923
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,720
That was a fiery inferno. Holy [ __ ]

924
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,399
What the heck?

925
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,240
What the heck? Hey

926
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,159
Nick,

927
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,000
what the

928
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,200
A bunch of a bunch of nut in the

929
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,880
streets. That's crazy.

930
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,840
I'm so for real right now. You got to

931
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,320
try this. Hurry up. What? What? Try it.

932
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,919
Spin the camera. Try it. Chris, please

933
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,519
try this. I'm so good at

934
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,840
this. Look like this could easil This is

935
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,200
like viral meme potential right here.

936
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Try this. It's good. Eat it. It tastes

937
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,880
good.

938
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,799
Try it.

939
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
Come on.

940
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,240
Isn't it crazy?

941
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,799
No, it's good.

942
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,799
It's so good.

943
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,480
Okay.

944
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:55,640
No. No. You eat the crunchy bit there.

945
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,640
[Music]

946
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Guess

947
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,359
we're going up.

948
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,119
That [ __ ] creme brulee I ate all to

949
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,000
myself, half asleep in Italy. Someone

950
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,800
sent me that video. That was the best

951
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,119
moment of my life. Were you recording

952
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,280
the whole time I was talking? That was

953
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,599
the best moment of my life. And here you

954
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,159
you heard me caught off guard sharing

955
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,879
about that [ __ ] thing. It was this

956
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,480
big all to myself. And look at what I'm

957
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,119
dealing with now. Puny [ __ ]

958
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,000
Is this wet, too?

959
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,760
What? Nick,

960
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,440
this is wet.

961
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,720
What's

962
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,639
my hands are wet? Can you tell me?

963
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,200
It's not wet.

964
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,119
It's not. Kirby absorbed all of it.

965
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,280
He's what?

966
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,919
He absorbed all of it. I'm wet.

967
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,159
Thank God for him.

968
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,359
Do you want to explain your current

969
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
situation at all?

970
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,160
No. You need to learn how to [ __ ]

971
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,000
pack your bags. This is wet. Like this

972
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,960
is soaking wet and it smells like I'm

973
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
not going to be able to like

974
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,200
It's not that big of a deal. It's a

975
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,720
little damp and it's cuz a face mask

976
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,480
exploded.

977
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,160
You zip this side up. You zip this side

978
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,160
up. You have a perfectly good suitcase

979
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,440
to go. You stuff that fat [ __ ]

980
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,400
in the middle and that's what your

981
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,240
suitcase is.

982
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,160
This is wet and sticky. Like that's

983
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,400
going to ruin like all the [ __ ] on this

984
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,320
side.

985
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,560
No, it's not. No, it's not. It's a

986
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,599
little damp. Ruin all the [ __ ] on that

987
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,160
side. No, it's not.

988
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,400
Yeah, it is.

989
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,720
I promise to god it's not. It's

990
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,040
also your fault for like having so much

991
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,960
stuff.

992
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,200
Well, like I'm just thinking about this

993
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,119
logically. I have to bring Kirby, so I

994
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
have to get another suitcase. Carry

995
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,680
Kirby through the airport.

996
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,520
No, it's that simple. That's the only

997
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
and effective way to do it. I'd rather

998
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,839
wheel a suit.

999
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,000
The reason I'd rather wheel a suit.

1000
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,680
Listen, if you zip the face mask up in

1001
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,160
this [ __ ] like this, how I had it, it

1002
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,400
would have been fine. It popped cuz you

1003
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,240
stuffed Kirby between it both sides.

1004
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,960
No, but I I don't want to carry Kirby

1005
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,960
and I think I need

1006
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,480
Put him in your backpack. My backpack's

1007
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,760
full cuz I have our vlog camera.

1008
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,800
Take the vlog camera.

1009
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,079
You don't understand. It's not

1010
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
I could get Kirby in your backpack.

1011
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,520
No, you couldn't.

1012
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,079
Yes, I absolutely could.

1013
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
No, you could.

1014
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,320
Okay.

1015
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,960
You can get Kirby in my backpack without

1016
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,720
me looking like a ninja turtle.

1017
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,440
I don't think

1018
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,440
it's not my fault.

1019
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
Done.

1020
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,680
Curvy's in there.

1021
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,920
Yep. Kirby,

1022
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,760
he's in there.

1023
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,030
Kirby's in there. It's safe and sound at

1024
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,330
the bottom.

1025
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:36,560
[Laughter]

1026
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:39,839
[Music]

1027
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,160
Oh my god. Watching you guys try to pack

1028
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,920
for the last 20 minutes has been the

1029
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,640
best thing ever.

1030
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
Can you just like

1031
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,560
A face mask exploded. Nick,

1032
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,839
can you just check what's wet? Because

1033
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,400
my hand is sticky. I can't tell. Check

1034
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,000
over here.

1035
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,880
Dry. Dry. Dry. Dry.

1036
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,040
Check over here.

1037
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,560
Little wet. Dry. Completely dry.

1038
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,800
Completely dry. Completely dry. Can you

1039
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,560
be honest and take your little bit wet

1040
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,280
along the seams where the face mask

1041
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,839
exploded?

1042
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,119
Yeah, I should keep completely dry.

1043
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,720
It's nylon, though. It's not like going

1044
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,440
to stick. Just zip it up and you're

1045
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
fine. No,

1046
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,520
but I don't want all the things in there

1047
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,040
to be sticky.

1048
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,320
Nothing's going to be sticky. And it's

1049
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,520
all closed. It's going to go in a

1050
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,400
machine washable.

1051
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,880
Do you promise?

1052
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Yes. Now that Kirby's in your backpack,

1053
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,760
you're living free. Like, but it's also

1054
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
like now you're going to find something

1055
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,880
to complain about in your backpack.

1056
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
No, if I know Kirby's with me, I won't

1057
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
complain.

1058
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,839
Our vlog camera is going to like break

1059
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
and then you're going to be like, "Well,

1060
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,599
it's cuz you stuff Kirby in my

1061
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,240
backpack."

1062
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,359
If that does happen, that is

1063
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,359
100%. Obviously,

1064
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,880
you're just like suck at packing.

1065
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,440
Like the thing is I could spend 60,000

1066
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,920
yen and com and this would all be over.

1067
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,000
I could put everything right in my sight

1068
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,359
in one suitcase. Boom. And check this.

1069
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,440
You going to pack the second suitcase?

1070
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,359
I will.

1071
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,640
I will.

1072
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,440
You can't even say it.

1073
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,000
I will.

1074
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
No, you will.

1075
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
I will.

1076
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,520
What are you going to put in the second

1077
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,520
suitcase?

1078
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
I

1079
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,320
this belt.

1080
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,599
Okay.

1081
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,680
This leaning on the [ __ ]

1082
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,599
wet everywhere, man. I'm sorry,

1083
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,800
dude.

1084
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,760
Oh my god.

1085
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,880
No. No. No. No. I just don't want my

1086
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,200
stuff to get ruined.

1087
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,520
Nothing's ruined. The only person

1088
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,880
ruining your life is [ __ ] Kirby.

1089
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,320
That's it. That's the only person.

1090
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,800
It's not true.

1091
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,720
You put a pack of like a jelloy face

1092
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,160
mask in right in the back.

1093
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,320
Who packed for me?

1094
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,800
I did and then I thought it was over and

1095
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,400
you stuffed Kirby between the two. Nick,

1096
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,920
it's the only reason it exploded. It

1097
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,200
would have been perfectly fine.

1098
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,000
It's just soaking wet.

1099
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,720
No, it's not. If you go buy if you go

1100
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,720
buy a whole suitcase.

1101
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,160
Feels like it's going to be unwarable.

1102
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,119
No, this is

1103
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,119
Does it look like ridiculous?

1104
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:10,000
I I promise the backpack is not what

1105
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,920
looks ridiculous right now.

1106
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,920
Like, but my thought is all mystery

1107
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,920
solves.

1108
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,720
What's funny?

1109
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,720
Holy [ __ ] Look at his outfit.

1110
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,320
If you left Kirby here and I bought the

1111
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,079
exact same replica to our house, I won

1112
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,119
him in Japan. I'm not leaving him

1113
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,839
behind. Like, what is going on that you

1114
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,240
think that that's okay? Do you have a

1115
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,359
heart?

1116
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm done.

1117
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:46,160
I'm not letting this happen. You're

1118
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,160
You're not buying an entire suitcase cuz

1119
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,119
you don't want to carry Kirby to the

1120
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,400
airport. Can you warn me or

1121
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,240
you are [ __ ]

1122
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
like that's the thing that's like that's

1123
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,920
what's bothering me is like I'm a

1124
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,119
21-year-old adult and you have and you

1125
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,880
have no superpowers over me. Like you're

1126
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,040
not my boss. You're not my mentor.

1127
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,000
You have a scope of how much money how

1128
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,920
money works.

1129
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,920
I do. You make a good amount of money.

1130
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,680
You're a young successful gentleman. So

1131
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,280
now it's like, "Oh, now I'll just blow

1132
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,440
I'll get another suitcase cuz I want

1133
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,760
this." The service charge of an

1134
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,560
overweight bag or the damage to all my

1135
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,760
items is going to be more if I try and

1136
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,839
fit Kirby in here and if I listen

1137
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,680
listen. I just bought nice new glasses

1138
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,680
and I have my laptop.

1139
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,480
Okay. Okay. Listen. I put my laptop,

1140
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,720
nice new glasses that I bought and

1141
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,480
and our vlog camera in there. I put

1142
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,560
Kirby in there. I make the backpack

1143
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,040
really really tight. A security guy

1144
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,599
throws my bag across the [ __ ] place

1145
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,440
when

1146
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,760
or during the [ __ ] security

1147
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,920
down through

1148
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,480
if something happens or if I [ __ ]

1149
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,720
bump into something or something goes on

1150
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,400
or I put my bag down. Even lightly

1151
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,800
putting my bag down if it's that

1152
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
comfort.

1153
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,000
You realize he's a pillow, right? It's

1154
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,000
like actually it's like putting bubble

1155
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,440
wrap around all the stuff. Bro,

1156
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,880
it's like actually the only reason it

1157
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
broke something in here is cuz you're

1158
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,599
cramming it between two closed sides of

1159
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,040
a suitcase and you have a packet of air.

1160
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,720
What happened in there?

1161
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,319
You're not sandwiching shut. You're just

1162
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,359
oh putting it in the backpack and then

1163
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,960
you're balancing something

1164
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,680
and then I'm going like this zippers and

1165
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,599
[ __ ] pull.

1166
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,599
No, you're not. Did you see it placed

1167
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,760
inside? I'll like give him a shove or

1168
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,599
two just to get it to the bottom. Just

1169
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,560
to get it to the bottom. Now he's at the

1170
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,319
bottom fully there. not going any

1171
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,200
there's there's no hindering anything

1172
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,079
right in the middle peacefully right in

1173
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,480
the middle or right on the side very

1174
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,000
easily just have to get it to angle

1175
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,040
itself microphone placed right there

1176
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
much pressure on all sides

1177
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,359
there's no pressure there's no pressure

1178
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,480
at all there's there's room I can fit my

1179
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,040
whole finger around it

1180
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,599
zip it up

1181
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,240
no room

1182
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,599
zip it up

1183
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,240
zipping it up

1184
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,599
peacefully zips closed

1185
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,319
Do you think anything in there is going

1186
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,560
to break?

1187
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,680
Nothing's going to break. My heart's

1188
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,000
going to break if you go downstairs and

1189
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,119
buy another suitcase cuz that cuz you

1190
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,040
don't want to carry this.

1191
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,400
This is a standard backpack to like

1192
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,359
carry it through the airport.

1193
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,800
Oh, I'm going somewhere.

1194
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,119
I think it looks a little better on you

1195
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,359
right now.

1196
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,960
Kirby's not going to like burst open in

1197
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,560
the backpack. The only reason it

1198
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,760
happened in your suitcase is so a

1199
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,359
[ __ ] airbag of a face mask here.

1200
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,319
If you zip that, what does it look like?

1201
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,640
Is it reasonable?

1202
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,520
This.

1203
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
Can you close it?

1204
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,960
It's going to look fine. It's flat.

1205
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,839
Flat. All you have to do is close it and

1206
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,760
zip it.

1207
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,359
A little heavy underwear in there.

1208
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,200
My dirty underwear. It's

1209
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,200
looking like it looks normal. Like

1210
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Yes, I do. I know for sure.

1211
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,160
I've packed your bag for [ __ ] eight

1212
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,000
years, Nick. I've I've never seen a

1213
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,440
suitcase this jam-packed. And I can

1214
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,480
still guarantee you it's nothing's going

1215
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,359
to break. The only reason your face mask

1216
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,680
full of air broke is cuz you jammed

1217
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,880
Kirby's fat ass between the suitcase.

1218
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,480
I don't

1219
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,480
If you buy another suitcase, I'm never

1220
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,050
person to travel with says you. You're

1221
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,079
the

1222
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,240
[Laughter]

1223
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,480
go right now. I'll go right now. No,

1224
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,760
you're not. Yes, I will. I'll take my

1225
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,599
bag.

1226
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,560
Nick, you're not.

1227
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,040
Nick, do you understand how many years

1228
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,839
have I packed your luggage?

1229
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,400
I don't know. You dress like an idiot,

1230
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,180
first of all.

1231
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,330
Yeah. Okay.

1232
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,330
[Music]

1233
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,800
Where's that? Stop.

1234
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,030
This would be ideal.

1235
00:43:48,800 --> 00:44:07,710
Baby,
