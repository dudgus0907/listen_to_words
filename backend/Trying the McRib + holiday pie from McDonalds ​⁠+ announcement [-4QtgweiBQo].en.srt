but I can like they're doing good for I

161
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,560
never ever actually thought that I'd

162
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,240
have a MC rib in my life but it's

163
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,680
definitely not like my favorite

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,599
McDonald's meal you know what I mean God

165
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,599
that's like the last matter how imagine

166
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,120
someone's fully debating oh should I get

167
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,960
chicken nuggets or like a MC GB get

168
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,720
chicken nuggets no Nick stop no just

169
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,280
play it safe and get the McNugget as

170
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,520
much no the way that I'm going to put it

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,919
is no matter how much I grow in my life

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,039
and grow up

173
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,280
thing I'm never going to I'm never going

174
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,039
to stop eating chicken nuggets I'll be a

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,960
[ __ ] million years old eating chicken

176
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,879
nuggets I do think if the MC rub is your

177
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,520
favorite thing for McDonald for being

178
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,479
for that being McDonald's tast

179
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,319
banishment for that being McDonald's

180
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,639
cake on on ribs not bad it's good for

181
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
McDonald's not bad now good we have to

182
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,639

bad do you like the cream I'm never

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,120
really like it's a bit of a cream

200
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,120
overload like I feel it's putting a lot

201
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,760
of

202
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,839
cream you can dial the cream back a lot

203
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,760
yeah I agree this way too much cream but

204
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,720
the outside shell is all right the shell

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
was good it's really me with the amount

206
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,279
the heaviness like there's a lot of

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,079
cream but it still tastes super dry yes

208
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,640
I agree and it's freaking me out I agree

209
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,200
like how there was so much liquidy kind

210
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,760
of cream in my mouth

211
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,680
but it feels like that's a dry thing you

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,240
know I agree I do agree it's like

213
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,720
there's way too much cream in here for

214
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,959
me to feel like it's

215
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,839
dry that's how they talk about things in

216
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:48,079
like cooking shows yeah oh so dry oh so

217
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,079
