45
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,680

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,960
like you say Coke or Pepsi and then

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,920

like it's kind of flip-flops it's

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,079
whenever that moment endures it's almost

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,799
like they're telling you a substitute to

51
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,680
what you can't have so it kind of feels

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
a little negative I had that experience

53
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,200
the other day for the first time oh my

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560

55
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,759
positive experience really I said hey

547
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,840

548
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,520
other day cuz I was like I was like

549
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,120

550
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,720
I don't I'm not hungry I just like got

551
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,520
to put something in my stomach you know
