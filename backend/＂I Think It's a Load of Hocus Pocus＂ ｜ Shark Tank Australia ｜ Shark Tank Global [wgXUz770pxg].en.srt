00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,960
Hi sharks. My name is Jen Lawrence and

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,439
I'm the owner and founder of a website

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,599
called newwagstore.com.

4
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,840
I'm here today to offer you the

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,600
opportunity to invest 100,000 for 10%

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
equity in my business.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Hi Sharks. My name's John Bennett. I'm

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
Jen's life partner and I'm the numbers

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,879
guy.

10
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,399
I didn't grow up with much. One of the

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,920
things I looked forward to was going to

12
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
my great-g grandandmother's house on a

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
Sunday for a roast lunch. After the

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,079
lunch, my grandfather would give us a

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,239
cup of tea. And I didn't particularly

16
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
like the tea, but if I drank it, my

17
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,760
grandfather would read my tea leaves.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,320
When I was 17, he gave me a set of tarot

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
cards. And he said, "These cards were

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,320
given to me when I was not much older

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
than you by an old gypsy lady. She

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,360
handed me the cards and she said, "Keep

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
these and one day you will give them to

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,600
somebody who will share them with more

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,119
people than you could imagine." And

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,479
those cards went on to become the

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,320
cornerstone of my website.

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,600
In 1999 when I created my website, I

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,159
started with a dream, a hobby, and a

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,960
passion to create the very best

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,960
spiritual and guidance website on the

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,560
planet.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,880
I now receive over 600,000 visits a

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,840
month. I do 2.2 million readings every

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,240
month, and that equates to about 6

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,560
million page views every month.

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
So, from humble beginnings, I've turned

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,040
my dreams into a reality. I have an

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,719
almost completely passive income, a 90%

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,280
profit on my business, and I have earned

41
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,280
over $1 million,

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
or which one of you can see into the

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,400
future and realize the true potential of

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
newagtore.com.

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,440
So, what I'd like to do is just give you

46
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,959
an idea of what the website looks like.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,959
Okay.

48
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
So, if I go into the tarot section,

49
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
we've got about nine different options

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,160
to choose from on the readings. And from

51
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,319
here, I can either pick my cards or I

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,160
can allow the universe to choose them.

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,800
So, you don't read, it's automatically

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
generated.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
That's correct. It will connect you with

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,480
your higher self and you will take from

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,480
it what you want.

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
So

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
over the last three years, can you give

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
us the numbers?

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,000
Last three years have been fairly

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
constant.

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
Okay. So is it is it 100,000 bucks a

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
year, 200,000 bucks a year?

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
About 140,000

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
per year for the last three years.

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,200
Per year for the last three years.

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,239
After paying for all your expenses,

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
where are we at? Uh

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,920
108,000

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,920
um per is your profit. Is our profit

72
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,440
Can you explain how you earn the

73
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,040
revenue?

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
So the way that it works in its current

75
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,360
format, the website is entirely free.

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
All the readings are free. However, I

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
generate my income in one of two ways. I

78
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
have Google ads on my website and I also

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
have an affiliate system where it's a

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,599
sign up system that I get a kickback

81
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,760
from that one as well.

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
How much time per day are you on this

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,440
site supporting it?

84
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,959
About 2 minutes a month. 2 minutes a

85
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,959
month.

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,959
Yeah.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
Why aren't you taking some of 108,000

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
bucks a year and actually turning it

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,239
into a lot more?

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
It It's actually been run as quite a

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,040
lazy business.

92
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,560
It's 2 minutes a month. It's a fantastic

93
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,560
way to demonstrate how light touch it

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,560
is.

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,799
And now we want you to come and drop 100

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
grand into it rather than taking our 100

97
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
grand into it. I I do have some issues

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,799
with I don't go for the whole spir

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,350
spiritual thing. I think it's a lot of

100
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,120
hocus pocus.

101
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,240
[Music]

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,240
I'm out. Thank you very much.

103
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
So, isn't the risk that if for some

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,080
reason Google decides not to pay for

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,680
Google Ads or changes their model Yes.

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
that your revenue stream would cease

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,960
immediately? You're completely right,

108
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
Janine.

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,160
One of the reasons that we'd like the

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
money is I'd also like to introduce a

111
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,040
paid reading and they would be charged

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,479
at $5 US.

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
So, you would then do the reading

114
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,919
yourself?

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,280
No. Still be automated.

116
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,880
Jen, I'm really disturbed. As a

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
scientist, I'm just sitting here

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
flabbergasted that in this modern age,

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,960
people are going to this site making

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,800
life decisions that are really serious.

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,639
And it's an on an automated slot machine

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,320
and it really upsets me.

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,280
How much do Australians spend on hope

124
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,919
which we call betting

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
to say that dreams are possible or hopes

126
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,600
or difference aspirations. I just I just

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,600
think that that's actually a little

128
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
naive.

129
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
The reality is I'm not going to be your

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,160
ideal business partner. I'm struggling

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
with the ethics of it.

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay.

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
So I'm out.

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
Okay, talk to me.

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,039
Yes.

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,639
Yes. There is a lot of people in this

137
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
space. So tell us what else is going on

138
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,400
in the space.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
The spiritual industry worldwide is

140
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,560
worth billions of dollars. The model

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
that we're looking at is not that

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,240
dissimilar to her main competitor's

143
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,960
model, which in 2011 with a suite of

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,840
five other.coms was sold to a Japanese

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,800
publicly listed company for $17 million

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,800
US.

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
I'm involved in a bunch of online

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
businesses and I've made a lot of money

149
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
out of them. Mhm.

150
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,759
You've done well to kind of sustain it

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,400
and build this community,

152
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,240
but I think I've based my life on the

153
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,039
fact that, you know, if it is to be,

154
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
it's up to me.

155
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,080
Yes.

156
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,080
And I don't really, frankly, want to be

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,080
involved in a business, which in some

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,600
ways gives people an out on backing

159
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,120
themselves.

160
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm sorry, that's just a personal

161
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
decision.

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,199
Yep.

163
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,199
I'm out.

164
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,960
I actually one of these people that do

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
believe that there's people out there

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,280
that has very very strong intuition. Now

167
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
whether that means they can see the

168
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,560
future or they can see goes I I don't

169
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,639
know but I do believe that people do and

170
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,080
so I take that really seriously and

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
people take it very seriously. So as

172
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,319
soon as it goes down the path of paying

173
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I just don't feel comfortable about it

174
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,599
but I wish you all the very best and

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,080
well done for what you've achieved to

176
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,080
date. But on

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,160
there was one

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Nami.

179
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,129
[Music]

180
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
I happen to have met the woman who

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
founded horoscope.com.

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,919
Oh, that's cool.

183
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
What an amazing entrepreneurial journey

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
she's had.

185
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
Yeah.

186
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Her exit was the greatest return on

187
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,240
capital invested probably in

188
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,240
Australian.com history.

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,120
You have a $1 million valuation on your

190
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
business.

191
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Yes.

192
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,800
Which at your present earnings is

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,520
actually 10 times the valuation which is

194
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,520
actually very high.

195
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,360
I'd be far happier

196
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,080
with a $100,000 investment for a 20%

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,080
stake in your business.

198
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,840
You came in looking for 100,000 for 10%.

199
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
If you accept the offer, you're going to

200
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,120
pay twice as much equity.

201
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
Can I speak to John about it?

202
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
Yeah, sure.

203
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm very transparent. We're not going to

204
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,159
walk out. I'll just have the

205
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,159
conversation right here in front of you.

206
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Does that mean the business is only

207
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
worth 500?

208
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,320
Yeah. Yeah. She's valuing the business

209
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
of 500

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
and Nomi gets 20%.

211
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,160
So each month I pay her 20%.

212
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,839
So we lose 20% of our current income.

213
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,080
Okay.

214
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,279
For the $100,000 investment.

215
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,480
Right. Okay. Right. I think that sounds

216
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,480
good. Am I supposed to ber?

217
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm not going to b I love you. I love

218
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
you and Janine and I would absolutely

219
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
love to work with you on my business.

220
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
Excellent.

221
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Congratulations.

222
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
What can I say?

223
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
Thank you so much.

224
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Congratulations.

225
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
Oh, love.

226
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
Thank you.

227
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
And congratulations.

228
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,279
Well done.

229
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,440
How to meet you. Thank you so much.

230
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,959
Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah,

231
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
we'll see you soon.

232
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,399
I'd have to say I don't think that

233
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,040
valuation was that bad for an online

234
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,959
business. However, I do accept that you

235
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,360
will bring her a lot of value. So, good

236
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,120
luck to you.

237
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
Well, I have to ask, did you see that

238
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,080
coming?

239
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,680
I did do my tarot cards beforehand and I

240
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
did get a pretty nice reading. So, yeah,

241
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
it was good.

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
What then does the future look like for

243
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,600
you now?

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,600
The future looks very exciting.
