120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,440
if you don't actually answer the

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,600
question and I always don't actually

122
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,680
actually answer the question cuz you

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,759

normally fudge or triple chocolate your

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,759
the question is fudge or fudge or chewy

173
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,960
absolute Breaking Point The Edge was

174
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,039

like has the open a wrench is not a tea

245
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,040

correct Hammer has Shar wa no no no

247
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,120

and that is what the shark is the hammer

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,839

daycare with you sometimes that's crazy

295
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,880
it's like I'm in an elderly home with

296
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,800
you sometimes cranky and sad whiteboards

297
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,959
underrated amazing lovely I think

298
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
they're underrated I think everyone

299
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,480
should have a whiteboard to organize

300
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
your thoughts and feelings I agree one

301
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,399
would be the craziest thing ever isn't

302
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
it crazy that a Blackboard is just a

303
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,560
chalkboard and a whiteboard is a dry

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,279
erase I hate chalkboards worst thing on

305
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,440
this Earth what it's dumping me you know

306
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,519
whiteboards like what would be the

307
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,560
coolest thing ever is if they had

308
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
whiteboards that you could draw

309
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
something and then' be like oh I need

310
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,600
this forever you can like lock it in and

311
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,199
then it like doesn't terrible that's

312
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
stupid

313
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,480
so what about I could already see the

314
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,279
amount of errors that that would lead to

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,959
like accidentally locking something for

316
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,920
eternity on your whiteboard and you have

317
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,160
to buy a whole new one I'm going to come

318
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,079
to a parking lot lat at night and just

319
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,560
start a bonfire and then invite everyone
