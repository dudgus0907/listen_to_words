1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,650
Burst into the tank is an innovation for

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:16,320
the modern office space.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:18,560
[Music]

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
All right, shark.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,400
Hey, you guys be quiet. We're trying to

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,400
pract.

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
All right.

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
All right. Ah, that's better. That's

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
better. Try again. Try it again. Hi,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
Sharks. I'm Anthony Poochie. And I'm

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,840
Nick Poochie. We're from Los Angeles,

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,079
California, and we're seeking

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,000
$350,000 for 10% equity in our company.

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
Sharks, it's probably been some time

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
since you worked in a cubicle or even

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,120
sat in an open office desk. But did you

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
know most offices today feature an open

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,840
design plan? While it's great for

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
collaboration and cutting costs, most

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,680
employees are less productive because of

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,960
it. That's because employees are

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,519
dissatisfied with their work

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
environment. In fact, a lack of sound

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,000
and visual privacy is by far and away

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,439
the biggest drain on employee morale.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,920
Introducing Cubic Call. Ta the modern

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,840
phone booth. Cubicall is the efficient

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,479
solution to the shortcomings of the

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
design of modern-day offices. Our booth

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,040
focuses on the four pillars of privacy

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,080
needs. audio, visual, territorial, and

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,680
information. So, distractions like

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,079
these,

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,119
girl, I know, I know, I know, become a

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,720
thing of the past.

36
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,400
And our cubicle booths are fully

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
customizable. They can be finished in a

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,040
variety of colors, materials, and even

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,200
custom graphics. And those bfolding

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,759
doors allow cubicle to fit into offices

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,159
where every inch of space is critical.

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,479
So Sharks, invest in us so we can help

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,920
employers invest in their employees.

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,680
Which one of you want to come down and

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,439
get a privacy break from Mr. Wonderful

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,479
and test drive one of the booth? Excuse

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,920
me. I want to try it.

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,920
Let me No, we are not doing this again.

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,520
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

51
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,480
Oh,

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,080
wow. There you go. All right. It's It's

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
really well. Will you say anything

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,239
inside, Robert? Yeah. Oh, you can't hear

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
a thing in there. Funny. Oh, you can

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,160
hear.

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,260
What's going on, guys? What?

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,080
It's It works. It's really does.

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,160
[Music]

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
Can you guys hear them? Barely. It

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,120
barely. It really muffles. It works.

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,120
Each booth comes with an air circulation

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
fan. Comes with a regular outlet so you

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
can plug in a laptop and two USB

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,879
chargers. Why don't you walk us through

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,720
the numbers? So, we sell the first one

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,120
there, which is our cubicle 2. We sell

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,120
it for $6,9.95.

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,920
$10,000. And what does it cost you to

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,519
make? Cost us $4,200 to make.

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
And how about the big one? The big one

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,319
is $11,9.95. Wow. What was the cost of

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,879
the 11K one? That one's $7,200. Now, but

74
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,560
wait a minute. Relation are relative to

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,800
that, they're selling theirs for about

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
$15,000. So, Nick, how did you start the

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
company? tell us. So, we started our own

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,159
marketing agency. It was an open plan

79
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
office and it's a family business, so

80
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,959
we're Italian, so we talk very excitedly

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,959
and we get involved. Come on. We just

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,720
got to the point where any important

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
calls or any meetings that we had, we'd

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,000
either had to leave the office to take

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,440
it going to stay stay home. I said, "We

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,959
can't deal with this anymore." And after

87
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
we put in our office and clients came

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
in, they said, "Hey, can you give me one

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
of these?" I said, "Yeah, sure." Once

90
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,000
you deliver it, do you just simply plug

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,319
it in and it works? Correct. Yeah. They

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
do have to be assembled, but as far as

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,080
we actually have a video if you guys

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,239
want to see it quickly being assembled,

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
you guys are fast, right? It's with a

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
little practice. So, yeah, ships flat.

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,159
It's super easy to assemble. Nick, have

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,920
you sold a bunch of them already? Yes,

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,840
we have. We sold about 70 booths. We

100
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,519
sold So, tell us your sales last 12

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,760
months. Uh, last 12 months, $495,000.

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,239
And when did you start the business?

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
Last August. How are you selling it?

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,319
Strictly direct to the end user online.

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,239
I like the solution, but there's a huge

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,840
problem here. You're making $1,800 on

107
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,519
the 6K version. Your margins are so thin

108
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,280
that the only way this business works is

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,720
selling direct to customers. Yeah, but

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
that's this is working for them. Why

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
would they end up working? Guys, it's

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
not working. You've only sold $495,000.

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
They've been in business for a year,

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,479
Kevin. No, but how do you feel about the

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,240
margins? Can you widen your margins? We

116
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,080
definitely can. If we get the investment

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,639
able to invest in the inventory, we'll

118
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,320
be able to add another 20 to 30%. What's

119
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,919
the vision? What's year two going to

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
look like? I mean, we want to get to

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,320
$2.5 million next year. That's about 300

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,000
booths. And we think with an investment,

123
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
we can definitely do that. Do you have

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,199
competition? Right now in the whole

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
market, there's probably about four

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,680
competitors that we compete with. Nobody

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
does a byfold door. It sounds trivial,

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,639
but you're putting these in because

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
space is an issue. Okay, that makes

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,199
sense. Yeah. You don't think that a

131
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,199
steel case could come in and undercut

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
all of the parts of this and bring the

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,600
price down by 50%. I I think they could,

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
but they they won't hit these price

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,520
points and these margins. I'd find that

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,520
hard to believe.

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
Congratulations on what you've

138
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,919
accomplished. It's it's great obviously,

139
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
but I've got a couple issues. One, it's

140
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,880
capital intensive. Two, when you're just

141
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,160
getting started, it's not unusual,

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
particularly for some when you're

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
cheaper, to get orders direct online.

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,919
But I think you're going to have to go

145
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
to some some other's type of two-tier

146
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,199
distribution. That doesn't mean it won't

147
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,639
be a great business for you two. It just

148
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,160
means it's harder to invest and harder

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
to get a return. And so for those

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
reasons, I'm out. But congratulations.

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Appreciate it. You know, you're a niche

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,039
within a larger furniture market. I

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,440
think this is a highly competitive

154
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,639
industry and I just don't know how

155
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,520
you're going to break into it. I'm out.

156
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,080
I totally get it. My only problem is

157
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,880
there are competition out there that are

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,560
already doing it and so I think I'm

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
gonna wait a really long time for a

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
return on my investment. So

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,319
unfortunately I'm out. Okay. All right.

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,919
Thank you. We appreciate it. Appreciate

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
it. I mean just to sort of paint the

164
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,120
picture. So they do say that 80% of all

165
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
offices are open plan offices. Now by

166
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,039
estimates there's maybe about 9.1

167
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
million businesses you know in the US.

168
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,120
If we were even to sell one booth to

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,800
point onetenth of 1% of those

170
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
businesses. Yeah. Everybody says that

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
about a big market. But get it. That's a

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
kiss of death on Shark Tank. When you

173
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,560
say all you need is onetenth of 1%.

174
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,560
Yeah. That that's never a good sign.

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,520
I'm going to make you an offer, but it's

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
commensurate with the risk. Okay. I'll

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,680
give you 350,000. I want 10% of the

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
company. Here's how I get paid back.

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay. You realize they came in asking

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,280
for 10%. I I'm not finished yet.

181
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,240
Silence, please. Every time you sell one

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,639
of these units, I get a $100. After I

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,680
recover 1,50,000, which is three times

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,240
on my original investment, it drops to

185
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,240
$50 a unit forever. Just what you want

186
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
in a low margin business. Look, it's

187
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
commensurate with the risk here. Maybe

188
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,599
Barbara can do better. Anthony, you got

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,880
to be careful. Kevin is a vampire. He'll

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,880
live forever. So, $50 is going to last a

191
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,120
long time. Um, I have a lot of

192
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,840
experience with this, surprisingly.

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,599
Here's my offer. It's better than his. I

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,720
think this is so complicated. I don't

195
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,199
know what it meant. Mine's pretty

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,680
simple. But I'm going to give you the

197
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:36,080
350,000 for 25% of the business. Ouch.

198
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,599
Wait, wait a minute. That's much worse

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,919
than my offer. Are you kidding me? Every

200
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,000
dollar that comes in, you get 100 bucks

201
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,560
and you get triple pay to mine reduces

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,160
over time. Mark, Barbara's forever 25%

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,960
of the company. You know,

204
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,520
Barbaraes to $50. That's very expensive.

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,360
What do you want to do? What do you want

206
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,840
to do? You might want to go in the

207
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,599
booth. We can hear you. Go in your

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,680
booth. You want to go? We'll go talk in

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,680
the booth.

210
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,759
This is hilarious. They're using the

211
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,360
calculator. Oh lord. Welcome back.

212
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,400
Did you guys hear us fight each other?

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,879
You had a word. What did you guys figure

214
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
out? So Kevin, we really appreciate your

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
offer. Yes. Uh it's a little too

216
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
difficult for me to figure out and for

217
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
the eventual sale of the company. Um

218
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,599
it's not a problem when you sell the

219
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,199
company because they just buy out my

220
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,399
royalty. That's what happens. Many of my

221
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,919
companies that's happened to $1 billion.

222
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,599
Go on. Still a little too complicated.

223
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,159
So Barbara, we would like to counter

224
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,240
with 350 for 15%.

225
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,959
It's not enough. I'm afraid I'd have to

226
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,200
turn that down. Yeah. I expect to do a

227
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,000
lot of heavy lifting on this business

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
and I have tremendous contacts in the

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
contract furniture space and I think I

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
can make the right introductions for

231
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
you. Can't budge on the equity at all.

232
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
Uh, no, because I want to be excited

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
about it.

234
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,200
What do you want to do? How about can we

235
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,120
do 450 for 20?

236
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,600
No. I really I feel like I need that

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,959
quarter slice to get really juiced up

238
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,480
about it.

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,959
Maybe you should revisit my offer

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
because it has merit.

241
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,440
Actually should think about it. Doesn't

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
sound like she's going to budge.

243
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
Anthony, I don't think these guys are

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,440
budging. What are you guys going to do?

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,440
What are you on?

246
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,399
Yeah. Okay. Barbara,

247
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,720
we'd like to take the deal. Terrific.

248
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,200
Good move. It's a good deal for

249
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
everybody. Thank you very much.

250
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
Appreciate it. My pleasure. Thanks

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
again.

252
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
Appreciate it. I think we got a great

253
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,880
shark in Barbara with her contacts. I

254
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,800
think it's going to do wonders for our

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
business. I see her point with the risk,

256
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,880
but I think it's I think we're going to

257
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,880
do great with it.
