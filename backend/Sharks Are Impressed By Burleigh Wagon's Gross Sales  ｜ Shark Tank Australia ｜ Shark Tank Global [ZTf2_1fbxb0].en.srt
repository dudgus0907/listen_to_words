Hi Sharks. I'm Reagan. And I'm Nathan.

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,200
And I'm the mom creator of the Burly

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,800
Wagon. We're here today seeking a

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,000
$450,000 investment in exchange for 10%

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,160
of our company. Wow. When we moved here

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
7 years ago from America, we ended up in

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
a beautiful spot called Burley on the

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,000
Gold Coast. We love the beaches, the

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
parks, the outdoor lifestyle that the

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,119
coast had to offer.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
But leaving the house with two kids

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,399
under two was quite overwhelming.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,399
Our daughter is on the autism spectrum

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
and we genuinely struggled to leave the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
house on longer outings and keep her

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,320
content. We searched for an alternative

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,200
on the market and we couldn't find

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
anything. So, we wanted to create

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,680
something that helped us as parents and

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,719
was a bit more fun as well. So, we

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
started by adding a built-in ESI cuz

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,120
every parent knows that snacks and cold

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
drinks are the keys to all success when

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,039
leaving the house with young kids. When

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,600
we moved here, there weren't a lot of

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,560
safe options for children to ride in.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,960
So, our wagon also has um safety belts

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
as well and complies with the AC safety

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,439
standards.

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
We also added a Bluetooth speaker with

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,759
two charging ports so you can plug in

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,280
all your mobile devices.

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,560
We can even plug in our USB fans so you

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,400
can angle the fan and chill out in your

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,200
wagon. Wow, so cool. We also added side

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,119
storage racks for your bigger gear.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
You name it, you can haul it in the

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,240
wagon.

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,119
Can Rean and Nathan wheel the Sharks in

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,920
for a

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,560
$450,000 investment for 10% equity of

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,200
their business? Great pitch, guys. I'm

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,720
Davey. Hi Davey. So basically you've

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,000
created the most souped up pimped out

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,840
beach wagon. Is that right? Yes. So I

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
was pushing an empty pram a lot of the

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,759
time with bags hanging off the back. Our

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,319
eldest is on the autism spectrum. So she

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,399
would get out, run in one direction, our

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,879
other child was in the other direction.

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
And I just it was pretty chaotic. So we

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,400
wanted to make something that they

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,080
actually like to ride in. It is awesome.

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,959
Thank you. It is the best wagon I have

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,239
ever seen. I have 5-year-old twins and I

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,280
have every wagon you can imagine. Here

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,040
in Australia, wagons are kind of a

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,640
different thing that hasn't been around.

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,760
You mean Australia? People don't use

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,959
wagons. We lived here in zero. I must

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,120
have 20 wagons in California. So, it has

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,239
been hard to kind of educate as to why

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,160
this will make a massive difference.

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,120
With fellow North American import Robert

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Robert Hersec on the bandwagon, he wants

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,519
to find out more about Rean and Nathan's

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,080
financials. How much is it? Uh, it

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,720
retails for $4.99 in Australia.

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,440
How much does it cost you to make? Our

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,879
manufacturing cost is $2.25.

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Well, that's a pretty high cost. It does

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
take 14 separate factories to make a

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
burly wagon and its accessories. Wow.

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
That is a recipe for something breaking

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,040
down in in that supply chain somewhere

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,920
along the way.

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to assume you sell it retail.

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,799
How much is the cost of If it

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,799
leaves Australia, it's about $1,000.

81
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,799
$1,000.

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Let's talk about within Australia, guys.

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Within Australia, we offer free

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,640
shipping. How much does it cost you? My

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,560
average is about 60 to 65. Whoa. With a

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,519
high shipping cost attached to their

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,000
direct to consumer wagon, e-commerce

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,959
giant Davy Fogerty is interested to see

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,360
if Rean and Nathan's modest margin can

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,840
be increased. So, you're making about

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,959
$110 a unit. Correct.

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
What do you think you'll be able to get

93
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
the cost of the product down to? The

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
most expensive component is the main

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,439
body. Um, right now just the main body

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,040
alone USD is $50. We're working with our

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
factory right now. They can get that in

98
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,519
half. Okay. So, can we can we talk about

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,919
similar products like this in the

100
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,479
market? Oh, for sure. For sure. There

101
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,919
are cheaper versions.

102
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
So, one of the points of difference of

103
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,639
ours is in 2019 the AC changed the

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
regulations in Australia. They said

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,639
anything that transports children in an

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,880
upright position must meet the safety

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,400
standards of a stroller.

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
So, a lot of people still do use the

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,560
Kmart one or the folding ones, but on

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
the box of all of those, it'll say not

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
intended for children. Not intended for

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
children.

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
When we were designing ours, Reagan

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
wanted something that can transport the

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,960
children safely and um carry all the

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,440
gear. There weren't any that had safety

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,120
belts. And especially for our two kids

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,000
in particular,

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,479
I can see how great the product is, but

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
you're asking for $450,000 for 10% of

121
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,479
the business. So that makes it a $4.5

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,039
million valuation. That's a big number.

123
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,440
So I'd love to hear about your sales. So

124
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,400
lifetime sales 2.8 million. Oh, great.

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,639
30 days ago, we did launch in the US

126
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,160
market and we've had a gross sales of

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,479
400,000.

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Wow.

129
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,759
In 30 days? Yes. I'm really excited.

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,039
What's the price point in the US? 750

131
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,880
AUD. Nice. the margins in the US market

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,800
are much better. And so what do you guys

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
plan to do with the investment if you

134
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
got it today? So it's it's to to get

135
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,240
ahead in stock. It's a huge, you know,

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,440
Christmas summer gift. And we always run

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,080
out. Designed with safety in mind and

138
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,720
meeting Australian safety standards, the

139
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,160
sales of the Burly Wagon have blown the

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,800
sharks out of the water. Have Rean and

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,319
Nathan done enough to secure themselves

142
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,919
a deal? I've got three children. I get

143
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,160
it. So, I will be a customer. But my

144
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,440
skill set doesn't lie in streamlining

145
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,440
that whole manufacturing process.

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,800
So, for that reason, I'm out. Thank you,

147
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Reagan. I'm I'm honestly I've been

148
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
sitting here being like, "Oh, it's so

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,800
great." But what is it's just

150
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,440
there's just so many operational

151
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,600
challenges that this business needs to

152
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,919
overcome to being able to

153
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,199
scale. I I'm really sorry, but I'm out.

154
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,840
That's okay. Thank you so much.

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,240
I am a tech entrepreneur and this is not

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,960
really my area of expertise, but commend

157
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,420
you for everything that you've done.

158
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,629
But

159
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,629
[Music]

160
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,000
unfortunately, I'm out. Thank you so

161
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,599
much. Thank you. With three sharks out,

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,520
will self-proclaimed wagon lover Robert

163
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:14,000
Hershe support Rean and Nathan to bring

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,000
this American staple down under? Rean, I

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,880
um I'm a highly creative guy, but I'm

166
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,639
struggling. How would I make a deal

167
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,120
without taking all your equity? I will

168
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,000
definitely be a customer. Uh, as an

169
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,919
investor, I'm out. Thank you. Thank you,

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
Robert. And then there was

171
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,639
one.

172
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,120
So, you have kind of cornered us with

173
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,800
the $450,000. That's a substantial

174
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,639
amount of money, but I do believe in

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
your growth and I do believe that I can

176
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,199
help you in all of the areas that you've

177
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,199
just talked

178
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,639
about.

179
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,639
So, I'm going to have to make an offer.

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll give you the

181
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,960
$450,000 for

182
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,360
30%, but I also just want a $4 royalty

183
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,770
per

184
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,440
unit until the money's paid back.

185
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,039
[Music]

186
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,800
Can we take a second to chat? Would that

187
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,800
be okay? Yeah. Thank you.

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
He He would be amazing. He's the shark

189
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
that I think would be able to expand

190
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
things. I do want to leave here with a

191
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
deal with him. It's just at that

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,680
valuation that would take us down to I

193
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,599
think it's under two million. So it's

194
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,159
it's a low valuation. Nathan and

195
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,440
Reagan, time kills deals. So if a deal's

196
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,760
been made, do it in the shortest amount

197
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,519
of time.

198
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,800
Sorry guys, this is hard.

199
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,560
He says no. Yeah. Then don't buy then we

200
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,560
won't. We'd have to.

201
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,880
Okay, Davey, thank you so much for your

202
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,120
offer, but we would like to counter you

203
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,120
at 25.

204
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
What about the royalty ring? For the

205
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
long-term payment, if we have to pay a

206
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,600
royalty till you get your money back,

207
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,959
that's fine. 100%.

208
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,959
If you come to a $10 royalty,

209
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,399
I'll do the 25%. Until the 450,000's

210
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,760
paid back. Correct.

211
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,160
the end of the day, this is Reagan's

212
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,160
decision to make.

213
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,800
You have a deal. Awesome.

214
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,720
Great. Awesome. I can't wait to work

215
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
with you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Seriously, we got a lot to do though. We

217
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,360
do a lot of work to do. But I think I'll

218
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,000
clear my calendar next week.

219
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
Rean and Nathan have done it. We'll fly

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,320
around. We'll have a wine in Adelaide.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,040
We'll see you guys later. They've

222
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:10,360
managed to reel in the youngest of the

223
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:14,800
Sharks and land themselves a deal of

224
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:18,320
$450,000 for 25% equity. We did good.

225
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,240
Yeah. Yeah. That was tough. It was very

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
stressful, but at the end of it, we're

227
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,760
super excited. Davey's the perfect

228
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
partner for us. It was important to us

229
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,720
to bring a product like this on the

230
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
market. It helped our family

231
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
tremendously, especially with our little

232
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,320
daughter. So,

233
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,320
yeah, it's definitely worth celebrating.
