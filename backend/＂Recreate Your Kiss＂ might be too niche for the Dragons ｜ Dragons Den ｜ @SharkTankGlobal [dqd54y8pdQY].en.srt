00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
hello my name is Jerry Daly this is my

2
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,039
wife

3
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,600
Kate we're here today hopefully to

4
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:38,600
secure an investment of £80,000

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,960
for that we're offering 20% Equity of

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,840
our

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,600
business a little bit about

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,559
me about two years ago I had a heart

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,600
attack and I had to have three major

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,719
heart operations I thought I was going

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,600
to die at one

12
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:01,480
point so I asked myself what would I

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,519
like to leave for my

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,799
wife and I always knew that she fancied

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,080
my bum and my kiss she said I had

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:14,799
kissable lips so I copied a cast of my

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,560
kiss and popped in the post went down

18
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,640
and had successful operations fit as a

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,759
fiddle

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:28,560
now but when Kate got home and found it

21
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,119
that was where send a kiss by Benji

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,759
evolved and here here it is the finished

23
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,520
product after a couple of years of hard

24
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,439
work this kit will enable the user to

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,759
recreate an exact replica of their kiss

26
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,880
each kit contains enough materials to

27
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,880
actually recreate two kisses so it's a

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,159
perfect gift for a couple it can be

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,920
bought and given as a gift in itself or

30
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,280
you can buy it and recreate your kiss to

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,719
give to somebody that you love although

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,280
this box looks very much as though it's

33
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,320
aimed for the Valentine's Day and this

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,280
one is there are other boxes in the

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,680
pipeline with different labels so it's

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,159

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,000
find a space in that

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,760

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,959

Enthusiasm uh this strikes me as one of

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,560
those kind of unusual products which

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,599
which really needs to be tested to see

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,360
how it's going to go so can you tell us

58
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:07,200
about your sales to date Yep this this

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:10,080
product is so new we finally put it out

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,840
to the market two months ago and what we

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,799
decided to do was to find out would the

62
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,720
public purchase it so we booked up um

63
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,799
the NEC festive Fair it's a 4-day event

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,280
and we sold

65
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,480
603 in the four days and that was just

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,680
wow yeah it knocked us backwards people

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,920
are paying their hard earned

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,799
cash and how much do they do they sell

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,120
for

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,519
$4.99 yeah it's the recommended retail

71
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,360
price can we have a look at a couple of

72
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,280
the would you like a sample product as

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,280
well take the kisses

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,799
over Jerry and Kate have got off to an

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,799
encouraging start with their kids but

76
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,840
new businesses like this can spell high

77
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,519
risk for investors theop fetus needs to

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
know more about where the investment

79
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,319
would

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,159
go so I'll give you £80,000 of my

81
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,680
children's hard earned inheritance just

82
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,000
tell me what you going to do with it

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
well the first thing I would want is the

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,720
injection mold machines injection

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,720
molding machines to do what to recreate

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,959
these boxes we own the tool we own the

87
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,359
right the copyright design the Bo and

88
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,639
that box is unique to Benji okay but you

89
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,360
can't go manufacturing every single

90
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,440
piece yourself no granted we could ship

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,600
them in it doesn't it doesn't

92
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,720
necessarily make sense because if this

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
is successful you won't be able to

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,039
manufacture them yourself no anyway so

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
how much is that going to cost um the

96
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,919
injection mold machines are about

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,680
£20,000 okay so there 20 grand worth of

98
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,919
Machin you need two but I'm just going

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,360
to save you £40,000 straight away

100
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,000
because the last thing you should even

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,759
contemplating doing is doing injection

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
molding that's somebody else's job right

103
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,800
the margin someone's going to make out

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,479
of that if you're doing volume isn't

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,800
worth talking about so forget that don't

106
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,120
even go there right let somebody else

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,600
worry about the health and safety

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
aspects of

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,120
that theop fetus has roundly condemned

110
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,000
Jerry and Kate's plans to spend half the

111
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,000
£80,000 investment on manufacturing

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,400
their packaging themselves rather than

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,520
sourcing it elsewhere Duncan bantine is

114
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,319
ready to have his say I don't think it's

115
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,759
got a fantastic shelf life you know I

116
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,960
don't think in 5 years time we'll see

117
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
res selling very well there might be an

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,680
no item for a few years then you can go

119
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,680
to do other things things but you make a

120
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,880
great living out of it and I wish you

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,720
the best of luck so I'm out okay thank

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,600
you Jerry and Kate's enthusiasm for

123
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,639
their product hasn't been enough to

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,720
convince Duncan bantine to invest will

125
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,639
Deborah miden see things

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,479
differently unfortunately I think in in

127
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,319
terms of scalability it's just not

128
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,280
something I'm going to be interested in

129
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,319
but you absolutely should walk away

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,600
today taking encouragement because it is

131
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,240
a good product and with your enthusiasm

132
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,840
behind it absolutely it's going to work

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,520
and you you'll you'll get a great life

134
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,520
out of it but not one for me so thank

135
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,400
you but I'm out I think everyone's

136
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,120
really pleased to see such an

137
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
enthusiastic couple you know and it's

138
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
great to see people who really enjoy

139
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
business rather than just doing it for

140
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,319
the slog and the money and the whole B

141
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
it's not just about making money is it

142
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,479
you and as we said your only your only

143
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,840
thing for you to guys to watch out for

144
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,199
is that you don't get too carried away

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,720
you know but yes great product and uh

146
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,039
wish you the best of luck I'm out for

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,360
the same reasons as guys a fantastic

148
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,120
home bus and it's best without spending

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,880
too much money too quickly so I wish you

150
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,880
luck but I'm out as

151
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,599
well three dragons in quick succession

152
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,520
have now walked away from the deal they

153
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,639
all like the entrepreneurs but they

154
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,240
can't see an opportunity to make money

155
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:56,960
for themselves Jerry and Kate's last

156
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,960
hopes now lie with either Peter Jones or

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,680
theopus great story by the way thank you

158
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,879
um quite heart rendering really and

159
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,280
obviously I'm not punning but it is

160
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,319
quite quite an amazing story um a very

161
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,879
different idea yes which is why I was

162
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,919
quite struck by it however I want to try

163
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,800
and look at the opportunity and to try

164
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,800
and get real money out of this you have

165
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,479
got to sell a huge amount and build an

166
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,720
infrastructure around you and it's not

167
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,960
something that really excites me

168
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,080
although the product itself really

169
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,400
excites me and I think you've done an

170
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,919
amazing

171

Market this but I'll tell you what I

186
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,960
have noticed is that t two people have

187
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,800
got so much enthusiasm and energy for

188
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:19,599
the product that what you might lack in

who you are thank you now I'm going to

191
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,800
tell you I'm not going to be investing

because I don't think it's a business

193
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
for me this is really much a lifestyle

194
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,960
business that you could do incredibly

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,000
