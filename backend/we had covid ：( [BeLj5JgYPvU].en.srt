counter I don't want no false

137
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
negative the fact that we're still like

138
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,479
vlogging with Co makes me laugh so hard

139
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,199
like why normal people would be like

140
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,880
yeah I'm not posting a video this week

141
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,120
yeah I know going to be us soon so yeah

142
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:01,680
no Yeah we actually can't post on um the

143
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,680
20 the 29th for a podcast oh oh

144
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:11,120
yeah no Co for me no Co for

145
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,560
me I pretty much tested negative there's

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840
a very very faint line so the t hold on

147
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,080
let me spin my

148
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
camera oh my God don't mind how dirty my

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,319
countertop is but there's like the

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
slightest line ever at the tea so I'm

151
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,039
going to wait till tomorrow to leave my

152
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,960
room one because I might still be

153
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,599
contagious with Co two because I don't

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,360
want to leave my room

155
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,000
and also Chris is still testing negative

156
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,560
so I don't want to go near him until I

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,599
can like clean my room and like assure

158
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,080
that I am no longer going to give him Co

159
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,080
but tomorrow I should be good I like we

160
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,560
had all this like trash and recycle

161
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,560
right here so I just went through it and

162
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,919
just put it there so it's ready to get

163
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,720
thrown

164
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,960
away but I didn't actually go bring it

165
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,919
down to the trash because I don't want

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,840
to pass Chris's room just in case so

167
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,639
I've been staying here my bathroom in

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,960
the

169
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,879
kitchen and I recently added these to my

170
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,680
bathroom I don't know if it's like cool

171
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
or if it's

172
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,400
like

173
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,680
stupid but there's Bears he's in the

174
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,560
bathtub you know this is where I dry off

175
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,319
so like sometimes that's just like me

176
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
you know I stand right there and do the

177
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,759
same thing probably going to go clean

178
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,400
the kitchen and stuff too and just tell

179
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,840
Chris to stay in his room cuz our

180
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,599
 house is a mess cuz Nick and

181
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,959
Chris love to just leave

182
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,880
everywhere so there's that and I'll keep

how little I actually have in this room

189
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,000
like furnished it's kind of sad like

190
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,399
look at that whole side of the room is

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,720
like empty and then I have like my my

192
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,240
desk with that I bought at Home Depot

241
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:12,000
asking Nick where are all your

246
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,880
minute ago Nick what is this thing that

247
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,800
you have there I'll go back in my closet

248
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,000
to show you so I saw this on Shark Tank

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,360
forever

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,399
ago I'm actually kind of scared to do

251
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,959
this I saw it on Shark Tank forever ago

252
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,959
and this is called a chirp wheel and

253
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,200
it's supposed to like crack and stretch

254
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,920
your back and I always have consistent

255
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,360
back pain so I thought I'd get it but

256
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,399
I'll I'll use it to show you guys what

257
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,160
it does this is a very vulnerable

258
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,360
position so I'm putting this shirt over

259
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,360
my

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,279
crotch I cannot believe this video of me

261
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,279
is going to be on the internet hold

262
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
on

263
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,680

264
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
not

265
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,040
[Music]

266
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,839
working yesterday I literally got a

267
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:21,320
notification for my health app that was

268
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,320
like hey we um we sense a little bit of

269
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,959
laziness I'm sorry that that's just like

270
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,519
an insane call out but they it literally

271
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,079
called me out cuz it took less than 100

272
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,199
yesterday which in theory is not good

273
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,160
but like I'm sick and I don't really

274
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,320
have anywhere to step to but like less

275
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,079
than 100 steps is sickening

276
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,959
actually so I'm I think at some point

277
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,680
today I'm just going to paste my

278
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,240
room like that sounds like absolutely

279
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,480
insane but I think like I'll just like

280
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,360
go from like door to shelf over there

281
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,959
back like 40 times but I just woke up I

282
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,600
feel phenomenal so I hope I test

283
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,199
negative again last night I took another

284
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,639
covid test because I sent Nick and I

285
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,399
think I already vlogged this but I sent

286
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,320
Nick and matad a video like dancing

287
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,000
really really fast Nick's probably going

288
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,680
to like put it in this video while he

289
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,519
edits or something I hope he doesn't cuz

290
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,160
it was a really terrible disturbing

291
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,839
video of me trying to dance but um well

292
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,000

really value our friendship and I think

you're amazing and a lot of people are

411
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,840
uncomfortable by it cuz they hate

412
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,080
overwhelmingly positive stuff like Nick

413
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,480
like if I went up to Nick and I was like

414
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
Nick I'm so happy you're my brother he'd

415
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,640
be like oh thanks like I appreciate it

thank you thumbs up but I know deep down

417
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,440
he appreciates that and so does everyone

418
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,679
if anyone got a super positive message

419
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,240
they'd appreciate it just some people

420
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,440
don't know how to react

421
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,360

422
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,280
