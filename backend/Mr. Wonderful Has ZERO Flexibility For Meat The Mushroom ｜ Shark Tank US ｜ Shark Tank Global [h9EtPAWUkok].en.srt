1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,350
First in the tank is a healthier version

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,130
of a popular indulgence.

[Music]

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,199
Hi Sharks. My name is Marvin and I'm

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,240
Aaliyah. We're from Baltimore, Maryland,

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,640
and we're seeking 150,000 for 7 and a

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,240
half% of our business. Sharks, as a

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
husband and wife team, I can tell you

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
there's always two sides to every story.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
Oh, Marvin, don't even get me started

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
with that one. Take bacon for instance.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,960
It's so good and it pairs with

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,040
everything. Yeah, like high blood

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,000
pressure and heart disease, but it's

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
crispy and smoky. Full of saturated fat

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,559
and cholesterol, but it melts in your

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
mouth. It's so delicious. Marvin, all

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,039
those nitrates and preservatives. Come

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,200
on, babe. Okay, my wife is correct as

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,199
usual. But that's why we created a

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,000
better for you bacon. And we like to

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,760
say, if it looks like bacon, smells like

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,520
bacon, and tastes like bacon, it must be

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,000
mushrooms.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,960
Introducing Shrew Min, a plant-based

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,920
bacon made of sliced mushroom. Shroom

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,960
has only five clean label ingredients,

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,720
and soy ain't one. And the taste better

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,439
than pork bacon on a BLT, on a juicy

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,400
burger, on a salad. Just the thought of

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,320
it has me hungry. One bite of shama and

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
you won't believe you're eating sliced

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,360
mushrooms. In fact, that's what makes it

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,400
so special. It's not highly processed

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,600
and it's not made in a mold. Sharks, let

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,960
me show you how we slice our mushrooms.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,759
Hit it. Samurai guy. Samurai guy. Slice.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,640
Slice. Slice. Slice. Slice. Slice.

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,240
Slice.

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
Marvin. Marvin. Wait a minute. Wait a

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,720
minute. This is not how we slice our

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,320
mushrooms. Uh, you're right. But a guy

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,880
can drink, I guess. So, so Sharks, who's

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,600
ready to swap out the swine and start

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,320
shrew making the world happy with Meet

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,479
the Mushroom? Oh, boy. Now, this is it

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,880
in front of us. It is. Bye-bye. Meet the

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,479
mushroom. So, in front of you, you have

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,520
juicy BLTs and you also have some slices

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,879
of uh shama. It's actually really good.

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,120
No fat, clearly. Yes. Very lean. Yes.

52
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,400
Nothing squishes.

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,599
Nice and crispy. Crispy. It's smoky.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,360
Again, only five ingredients. Non-GMO.

55
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,120
You can cook it in the air fryer. You

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
can cook it in the skillet. If you don't

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,879
want to use any oil, you can cook it in

58
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,440
the oven. In Shark Tank, we've had so

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,599
many plant-based products. They all

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,160
taste like crap. No, they do not.

61
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,840
This is good. Oh, yeah. This is good. I

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,959
like it. What kind of a mushroom is

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,560
that? That's a king oyster mushroom.

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,239
That's a king oyster mushroom. Yes.

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,840
Those are expensive. What are your cost

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
of goods on this? Uh the pack that

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
you're holding currently cost $29 to

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,120
make. However, we know for a fact we can

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,440
get that down to

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:03,519
$1.75. We sell it retail $8.99. Wa. And

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
then uh to our distributor, we sell it

72
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,080
for $4.40. Tell us a little bit about

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
your background. So my background is as

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
a Facebook ads manager. Um my first

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
business was cars. Um I was wholesaling

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
cars. My next business was a mover and

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,200
that's how I actually me and my wife met

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,159
out was our mover, you know. Um, there

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,760
you go. Okay. A mover. He moved right

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
in. Yep. Yep. But, um, I had a heart

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,800
condition and, uh, the doctor said I

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,720
wouldn't I would have my whole for for

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,360
the rest of my life. I had, um, enlarged

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
heart muscle. So, I went vegan. I went

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
back to the doctors a year later and my

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,599
heart disease was gone. I had asthma

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,000
since I was eight. That totally

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,599
disappeared. Once I was healed, I saw

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
the powers of a vegan diet and I wanted

90
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,280
to open a restaurant in my neighborhood.

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
In the black community specifically, is

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
a lot of food um related illnesses in

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,760
the black community with heart disease

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,440
and uh diabetes. But while I was making

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,799
these items for the menu and I saw they

96
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,560
could not only just help my community,

97
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
but they could help the world. So, we

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,400
transitioned the idea into um a product

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
based business instead of a restaurant.

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,599
So, what do you do today for a living?

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,200
Is this the only job? The only thing we

102
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,879
do. So tell us about your sales. Does

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,160
that matter? Sales. So May of 2021 until

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,160
December of 2021, we did $38,000 in

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,440
sales. Um then for all of 2022, we went

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,040
up to $86,000 in sales. And then to

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,800
date, we have in over

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,000
$238,000 of in sales, making our

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,160
lifetime sales over

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,320
360,000. We're selling primarily 93%

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
direct to customer. We've only now

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
started to get into grocery stores and

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,479
so we are just getting started. But

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
you're a couple. You're both in this

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,400
business full time. Full time. How How

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
are you getting by to pay your bills?

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,960
Yeah. So, we actually have gone out all

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,720
in. We sold a car. We moved in with my

119
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,000
mother-in-law. Um, we are really scrappy

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,120
with this. Okay. We are all 100% in. We

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,800
have a daughter. There she is. And her

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,919
name is Nora. Um, Nora has Down syndrome

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,560
and so, you know, she is really our

124
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,199
inspiration. She's phenomenal.

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Look, I'm really intrigued because it's

126
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,360
so good, but valuation is insane.

127
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,600
However,

128
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
because I am a chef and because I'm Mr.

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Wonderful, okay, the way I see this

130
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,600
deal, I'll give you

131
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,680
$150,000. I want to be the third

132
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,800
partner, 33 and a3%. Okay. I have zero

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,400
flexibility. That's a fantastic. How

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
much flexibility do you have on this?

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Oh, I have zero flexibility. Okay. I

136
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
just want to I'll clear the deck. I have

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
a deal with Unreal Deli, which is a

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,720
plant-based meat product. We're getting

139
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,000
into the same space. So, that's going to

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,600
be a conflict. So, for those reasons,

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm out. But congrats on what you've

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
done. It really was good. Thank you. I

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,919
feel that the passion that you have and

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
congratulations and what you're creating

145
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
is amazing. And I think the path to

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
success will be challenging for a couple

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,280
of reasons. Because what you're doing

148
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,199
now is you're going to be instead of one

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,120
step away from the money, you're four

150
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
steps away because now you have to make

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,039
it and be an expert in manufacturing,

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
then you have to get the store to buy

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,319
it, get them to list it, and then get a

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,479
customer to buy it all at a onethird of

155
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
what you would have been. Guys, this is

156
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,600
all great chatter, but you know, you do

157
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,759
have an offer on the table. Let me tell

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
you where I see some of the bigger

159
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
challenges you may have. And for that

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,000
reason, I'm out. Thank you. Can I ask

161
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,919
you a few questions? Sure. So, just let

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
me add a little little spice to the

163
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,479
offer. Okay. I offered you 150,000 for

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,960
33 and a third. They were so excited

165
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,280
about going to go ju it's going to grow

166
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,680
like a mushroom a little bit because I'm

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,639
not feeling the love. Okay. I'm going to

168
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,039
go to 150,000 for 33 and 2/3%.

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,759
Okay. So, the good thing is I really

170
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,160
liked it and I'm your customer, right?

171
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
The bad thing is is I wanted more. So,

172
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,759
it's like normal bacon this long. Yeah.

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
Yours is this long. Your only thing,

174
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,120
Lori, is that it should be a longer

175
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,720
mushroom. Um, it's not always about the

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
size, man. That's right. It's not always

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,360
about the size. That's what she say. But

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
that's what she say. I want a bigger

179
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,400
mushroom. And Lori to speak to that as

180
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,240
well, you know, think varying slices.

181
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,759
Yes. Because the mushrooms are very the

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,240
same thing. Um mushrooms. I feel so

183
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:29,280
unloved. And now unfortunately I'm 33

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,759
and 3/3 better known as 34%.

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,360
Hey, we do love you, Mr. Growing like a

186
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
mushroom.

187
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Listen, Marvin Alia, you're very

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,080
inspiring to me. Thank you. Um honestly,

189
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,840
this is my fifth season. I've never seen

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
Mr. wonderful. Give a fair offer. And

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,759
this one is a fair offer. Okay. Given

192
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
where you're at, I was actually very

193
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,039
impressed with his offer. I don't think

194
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
I could give you that offer. Okay. And

195
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,240
so for those reasons, I'm out. Okay.

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Thank you. And I and I think you should

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
seriously consider his offer. Thank you.

198
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
One thing that I also want to speak to

199
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,639
that Damon said that I think should be

200
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,919
addressed. I think you should talk to

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,960
Lori because she's listen torn. There's

202
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,000
like there's like a little voice on my

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
left that's saying horrible valuation.

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,160
little voice to my right that's saying

205
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,680
but they're amazing and it's amazing so

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm torn you

207
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,319
know I will give you an offer for 33 and

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
the third oh

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,319
undercut Kevin would you would either of

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,639
you consider

211
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,240
uh cuz that's a lot more equity than we

212
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
were thinking of that we wanted it's

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
fair for you to say that but remember

214
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,000
the environment we're in the Fed has

215
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,320
raised rates at an unprecedented speed

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,640
capital is not cheap anymore venture

217
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,080
capital's dried And so the reality out

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
there is this offer is more than fair.

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
More than fair because we're in we're

220
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,160
back at where we were when we started

221
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,320
Shark Tank 2008. No money out there. And

222
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,399
here we are making you offers. I will

223
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
make you an offer that might sweeten the

224
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,120
deal. Okay. R.

225
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,519
What if Kevin and I went in together?

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Then you get two sharks.

227
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,279
What do you think, Devin? Would you

228
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
consider going in together

229
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,279
for 25%.

230
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,200
Look, I'll do that deal with Lori at 33

231
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,680
and a third and start you on your

232
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
journey. You're great people. Okay. Oh,

233
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. But

234
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,640
it's 33 and a3%.

235
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
This is the thing. I'm I'm going to keep

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,120
it real. 33% is too much for us right

237
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
now. Um, you know, we're going to have

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
to raise more money. Yeah, we're going

239
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
to have to raise more money. I know

240
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
money is drying up, but it is money out

241
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,839
there. And I think our product is going

242
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
to get some of that money. It's not

243
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,519
enough equity to We got to get up in the

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,640
morning and we got to smell the bacon.

245
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,680
Okay. It's a lot of work.

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,040
Would you consider 200,000 for the 33

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,279
and a 30% with both of you in and help

248
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,640
with POS? I'm not there.

249
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm not there. Sorry. What about your

250
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,920
34%. No, not there. You're over

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
negotiating. Guys, you have to make a

252
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,519
decision.

253
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,519
33%.

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,830
Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Do it. You

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,200
have a deal. Y. Congrats.

256
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,800
[Music]

257
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,839
Congratulations.

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,680
Thank you. Thank you. Making bacon.

259
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
Guys, well done, man. Good job. Thank

260
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,200
you.

261
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,200
You got the Got to do.

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
I'm not going to lie. It was very

263
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
painful to have to give up that much

264
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,680
equity, but we know that having two

265
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,600
Sharks on board, we're going to be able

266
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,200
to take our business to the next level

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,959
and really create a legacy for our

268
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,720
daughter, Nora. I can't believe we did

269
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,720
it.

270
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Yay.
