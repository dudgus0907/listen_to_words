00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,920
Hello Sharks. My name is Derek Burr and

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm from North Adro, Massachusetts. I am

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
the president and CEO of Quickhand

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Curtain Rod Brackets. Now, I'm here

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,800
today seeking an $80,000 investment in

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,199
exchange for a 20% equity stake in our

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,519
company, Sharks. As a police officer and

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
a former Marine, I faced many challenges

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
in my life, but none mightier than

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
hanging a curtain rod. Now, our unique

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
curtain hardware is going to change the

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,120
way that you hang your curtains, making

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,640
old curtain hardware obsolete.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,800
Introducing Quick Hang curtain rod

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
brackets, one-of-a-kind patented curtain

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
rod brackets that you can use to hang

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,000
your curtains in a matter of seconds,

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
leaving no visible damage. Now, our

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,200
proprietary brackets set themselves

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,199
apart from anything else on the market

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,840
by eliminating the need for nails,

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,680
screws, drilling, measuring, or marring

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,280
up the face of your woodwork. Now, we've

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
taken the trouble and aggravation out of

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
hanging your curtains. Allow me to

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
demonstrate just how simple it is to

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,240
install our curtain hardware. Blink

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,300
sharks, and you might just miss it.

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,920
Give it a few taps on this

31
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:18,119
[Music]

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,119
side and a few taps on that side.

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,159
You just tap it and you're done. It's

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,300
that easy. Now all you have to do is

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:30,200
hang your

36
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:32,560
[Music]

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,560
curtains. Sea Sharks, I wasn't lying

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
when I said they install in seconds. No

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
fuss, no mus, and no plaster dust. But I

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
know what you're probably thinking right

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
now. Will they hold? What I'm going to

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,119
do is I'm going to hang two 10 lb bags

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,680
of potatoes from the curtain rod. I

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,680
often do that.

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,560
Sharks hang curtain hardware is the

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,159
fastest, strongest, and simplest way for

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,079
you to hang your curtains. So, don't

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
leave me hanging out here all by myself.

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,399
The window of opportunity is open for

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
you to invest in our company. Thank you

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
for your time and I'll now pass out some

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,720
samples. Cool. Good job. I love the

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
demo. Very effective. So be very careful

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
because there's very sharp pins on

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
these. But Lor's are the white. The

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,120
white. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,640
Wonderful. Of course, you get gold.

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,720
Thank you, Damon. Silver. Thank you,

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,000
Mark. Are we going to do it? Yeah. Thank

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,000
you. Thank you. This is a very thin hook

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
here. Correct. What about curtain rods

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
that are one to one and 12 inch in

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,200
diameter or larger? Do you have

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,800
different sizes of this? We do have

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
different sizes. So right now we can

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
have we can hold curtain rods from/ in

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,480
all the way up to an inch. What why

68
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,519
don't you have the capability of going

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,560
bigger? Basically my dad started this

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,720
company and he gave the customers what

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,840
they wanted. But this is a piece of

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,080
metal right that's like stamped formed.

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,160
So why couldn't you just form it to be 1

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,760
and 12 in? I mean it's it's very

75
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,280
possible. It's just the tooling is

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640
expensive to do that. So we're just

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
working with what we have right now.

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,000
Correct. And your dad started the

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
company. He did. Is he still part of the

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,480
company? Uh, unfortunately, we just lost

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,800
him this past April. So, uh, I'm sorry.

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
My dad was in business, uh, was in the

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
jewelry business his whole life, and he

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
worked for a gentleman that had a

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,000
similar idea. So, my dad started a

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,720
little company on the side, started

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
selling them, and he started having some

88
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,440
success. So, my dad went back to his

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,680
boss and said, "Well, what if I go out,

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
I apply for the patents, I get the

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
inventory going." So, my dad's boss

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
basically laughed at him and said,

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
"You're never going to make any money.

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
Go ahead. And that's the wrong thing you

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,239
say to my dad. You never challenge my

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,159
dad because he's going to prove you

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,280
wrong. And so he started the business.

98
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,040
He did. You have how long ago? 2013. And

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,200
he was so proud of those patents. And

100
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,480
Derek, what are your sales? It's been

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
about 3 years. 120,000.

102
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,000
All right. What are your sales just this

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,959
year? And what were they last year? So

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,720
this year, year to date, we're uh

105
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,080
31,000. Last year 42,000. And what do

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,200
they sell for and what do they cost you

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,400
to make there? Singles uh landed are

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,200
$3.15. We sell them for $10.95. Doubles

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,560
are $4. We sell them for $17.95. How do

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,799
you sell them, Derek? Everything's

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,720
online. So for my website, eBay, and we

112
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
just signed a deal with House. So what

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,239
do you do full-time? Cuz obviously

114
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
$31,000 is going to pay the bills,

115
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,720
right? So full-time I'm a police

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
officer. And who's running the company?

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
I am. But Derek, you're making money. I

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
mean, your margins are good. On the

119
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,680
31,000 you probably made what 18,000

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
something like that. So, off the 31,000,

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
we've uh made about 7,000 because I've

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
been trying to grow the brand. The

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,199
business was in my dad's apartment. I

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,199
got us into a warehouse space. I started

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,199
having the packaging done. So, the real

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,440
issue about getting this in broad

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
distribution is getting the packaging

128
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,680
right to tell the story of what this

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
does, which is going to be one

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
challenge, and then getting a

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,400
distributor that sells curtain rods,

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
right? Sell them

133
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,360
together. But the trouble is, you're a

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,199
full-time and thank you again for your

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,680
service. police officer. You're not,

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,720
this is not a crazy deal. It's not

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,560
overvalued or anything. It's just who's

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,360
going to do the work. You're looking at

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
him. See, me running this business is

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
the one last link to my dad. This

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,759
business meant everything to my dad, and

142
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,800
this makes me still feel close to him.

143
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,479
So, I would retire from the police

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,080
department to run this business.

145
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,919
Wow. Dan, I got to ask you a question.

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,639
Um, are you motivated to do this because

147
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,280
it's in his honor or are you really want

148
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,880
to grow this business? Because those are

149
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,080
two different things. I'm passionate

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
about the business because it was

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,360
started by my father and my mother and

152
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
this is the only thing that she has left

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,120
of my dad. This is the only thing I have

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,440
left of my dad. So, this is basically

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
everything for us. Would you have the

156
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,880
same motivation to go on with sales of

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,880
30 40,000? You can't live off that. But

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,440
Kevin, with all due respect, this is

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,080
only with me doing this part-time. If I

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,319
had a shark behind me with the marketing

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,840
and exposure, this I have a I have no

162
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
doubt in my mind at this point, it would

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,720
take off the way you would expect it to

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
because there's still blocking and

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
tackling that has to take place. Right.

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,800
Right. And so, while what you've

167
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
accomplished is phenomenal, what your

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,360
dad has accomplished, but at the same

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
time, you're not you're not investable

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
yet because you're still figuring all

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,080
this out. I I don't think you're ready.

172
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
And and honestly, it's not my

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
wheelhouse. It's not really my strong

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,479
suit, these types of products. So, for

175
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
those reasons, I'm out. Thank you. Thank

176
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,039
you. And look, people have been doubting

177
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,319
me my whole life. People told me that I

178
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,759
would never make it through Marine Corps

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
boot camp. Told me I didn't have what it

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
took. Said I was too small. I served

181
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,680
four years honorably as a United States

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,759
Marine and I earned a Navy and Marine

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,400
Corps achievement medal. People said I

184
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
would never become a cop. Said it was

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,080
not possible. I've been on the police

186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,400
force now for almost 5 years.

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,120
I continue to chase my dreams. Good for

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,720
you. To honor your father is a beautiful

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,919
thing. And you've already done it.

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,520
You're you, right? So, I think here I

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,440
would take pause and stop and think

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,720
about is this the life that you want to

193
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,599
live dayto day because it's a huge

194
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
commitment, right? You have four

195
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:21,840
patents. To me, it's a licensing play,

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,680
right? And getting somebody to buy that

197
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,160
and then actually they have the manpower

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,840
to put it everywhere to me would be the

199
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,080
greatest legacy you're ever your father

200
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,080
ever had. Right. And I for me I know

201
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,240
what it would take. I mean it's huge.

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,000
It's huge amount of effort.

203
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,360
Um for those reasons I personally need

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,039
to be out. Thank you. There's a theory

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,360
out there that I need to quit my job and

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,039
I need to just go you know all out. And

207
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,319
what you do is then you you can't pay

208
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,479
the bills and then you can't put any

209
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
money into the business. You need to run

210
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,000
this business, but I don't think you

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
need to quit your job either.

212
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,960
It wouldn't be in your best interest for

213
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
me to help you because you need to

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,120
slowly grow this. So, I'm out. Thank

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,560
you.

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,039
The right path here is going to find

217
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,280
that that licensing deal that Lorie

218
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,759
suggested to you, right?

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,960
You want to make him proud, go get a

220
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,120
royalty check of 50,000 a month because

221
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,840
you have these patents, right? That's

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,759
the gift you really.

223
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,080
It's one of those deals that it's it's

224
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,479
just a beautiful story, but as a

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,399
business extremely hard to invest in.

226
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm sorry, Derek. I'm out.

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,880
Derek, I I love the dream. And you have

228
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,519
great purpose. Great businesses are

229
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,399
started with great purpose. You know, my

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:47,760
dad was thrown in jail 23

231
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,080
times. And uh when I was 21 years old, I

232
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,040
was uh I didn't know what I want to do.

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,320
I was a bit of a mess. Partying, hang

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
out. People say, "What do you want to do

235
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
with your life?" I go, "Ah, it doesn't

236
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,000
matter." My dad sits down with me and he

237
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,560
says, "I went through hell so that you

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,959
could have the opportunity I never

239
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,240
had." That was it. That was it. And for

240
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
the rest of my life, people said, "Oh,

241
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
how do you work so hard? You only sleep

242
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,240
3 hours a day. It must be hard." And I

243
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,160
always used to say, "Anything I do in my

244
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,220
lifetime will never be as hard as what

245
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,920
that man went

246
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,959
[Music]

247
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,440
through." But you've got to have

248
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
something that you can apply that to in

249
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
order to build a bigger business. I

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,519
wouldn't quit the job today. The price

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,000
point is just too small. But maybe

252
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,720
you'll figure it out. I I can't be in

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,519
today, but I wish you all the best. I'm

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,640
out. Thank you all for your time. Derek,

255
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,480
can I shake your hand? Sure. Thank you

256
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,760
very much. My pleasure. Thank you very

257
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
much. Wish you all the best. Thank you

258
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
very much. Congratulations. Thank you,

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Derek.

260
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,519
It's a good guy right there.

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
Yeah, I'm disappointed. I got a little

262
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
knocked down today, but my dad never

263
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
gave up on this product, and neither

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,200
will I. I'm going to definitely prove

265
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,200
them wrong.
