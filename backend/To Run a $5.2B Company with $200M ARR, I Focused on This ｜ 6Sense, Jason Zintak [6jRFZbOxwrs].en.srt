1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,040
go to too many events good for the ego

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,560
really aren't progressing a mistake you

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,519
make is thinking your line then you have

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,280
too many alternate pivots or agendas

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,200
where I spent nearly a decade in sales

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,960
and marketing roles challenges have a

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,839
history of repeating themselves there

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,720
are patterns we have people problems

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,279
product Market fit issues financing

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,279

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,720
name is Jason zint I'm the CEO of

sales and marketing platforms last 7

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,120
years we went from 5 million in ARR to

200 million completed our Series E $200

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
million fund raise at 5.2 billion in

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
valuation that was roughly a year and a

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,879
half ago 2000 customers a great cap

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,879
table of Marquee

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,960
investors customer acquisition in the

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,879
early days is very tough because why

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,399
trust why trust the startup with an idea

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,280
everyone finds a way or a relationship

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,840
for that first customer again it comes

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,480
down to solving the problem if you can

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,039
help someone solve a problem and you

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,600
find a friend a fan usually through a

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,199
relationship you might find someone to

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,920
trust you and give you a shot you need

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
to be vulnerable to these customers

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,520
saying can someone give me a chance you

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,200
need to lean on a relationship and you

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,240
need to bring something of value if you

34
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,159
find those aspects you can probably get

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,479
a customer and then you have to try like

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
hell to retain them satisfy them keep

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,360
them and make them better more than ever

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,119
we're now in a macro that's more

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,520
difficult post pandemic and that's all

40
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,240
around high value High return does it

41
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,000
help me do my job better more

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,320
efficiently with a dollar return and and

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,600
so we're focused on a mutual success

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,960
plan with our customers we set that plan

45
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,320
we communicate the plan add Innovation

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,399
and they'll give you honest feedback

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
feedback is a gift may be painful we've

48
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,799
lost customers along the way but we get

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,399
the feedback I think the big mistake is

50
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,159
not looking yourself in the mirror as a

51
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,479
company judging where you actually are

52
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,439
in your journey optimizing changing

53
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,119
pivoting adapting around that feedback

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,680
in B2B SAS world it's all about

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,600
retention and retention of a customer

56
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,600
retain your customer and can you cross

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,960
sell up sell down so what's the magic

58
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,399
quite often we find your buyers leave a

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,280
company the next year you've got to

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,719
renew your original sponsors aren't

61
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,640
there or what do you do because the

62
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,239
proclivity is new executive new tool and

63
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,360
so yeah we're faced with that as well

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,040
there's really one thing if the Baton

65
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,519
gets passed on your product to another

66
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,239
executive will they find Value in it for

67
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,120
us I really focus Less on the sales

68
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,120
strategies around human intervention and

69
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,160
tactics to relate with these exec have

70
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,480
we proven it up value through product

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,400
and delivery and Adoption of it that

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
when the next person comes in the door

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
they can see it and feel it such that

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,080
they aren't tempted to replace them with

75
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,879
their buddies from another past

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,560
relationship this comes back to our

77
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,599
mutual success plans that we write with

78
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,000
our customers if it's documented and we

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,680
achieve it those measurements should be

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
able to pass along to the next exec at

81
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,200
the end of the day it's just does the

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,159
product work and work well it will be

83
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,519
talked about inside the company if

84
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,519
that's the

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,640
case common mistake is sort of getting

86
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,799
too excited in the hype of a startup and

87
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,480
that around a fundrais and a concept and

88
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,159
it's all very energizing and toxicating

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,879
in a way at the end of the day you have

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,640
real work to do in order to be a high

91
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,720
performing team everyone needs to get on

92
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,280
board with our objective and go for it a

93
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,599
mistake you make is thinking you're

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,120
aligned and then you have too many

95
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,480
alternate pivots or agendas it is common

96
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,080
to really just get distracted go to too

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,440
many events really aren't progressing

98
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,720
good for the ego but not necessarily the

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,519
agenda of the company it's not

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,280
necessarily about the product we invest

101
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,200
in teams many many startups start with

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
one idea and end with a completely

103
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
different ultimately finds product

104
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,360
Market fit smart people goodw workking

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,799
teams figure it out but what they're EMB

106
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,280
betting on and what I can tell you I've

107
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,480
lived it's the team that makes the

108
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,599
difference that nucleus of team and

109
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,360
Leadership is Paramount it's not only in

110
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,959
the product but show up in the culture

111
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
and the eepos of your company by the way

112
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,159
it's one brick at a time to build the

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
house I joined at 30 and we're now over

114
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,400
1,200 constantly message uh what's

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,439
important to us and people like identify

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,120
and those that identify stay and those

117
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,439
that don't leave and that's that's

118
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,280
appropriate cuz you can't be all things

119
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,239
to all people there's no shortage of

120
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,920
leadership books that talk about making

121
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,760
tough decisions leadership is lonely you

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,400
have to make the call instally I don't

123
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
find leadership at all lonely I like

124
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,079
working with my team and I find us to be

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,160
more of a family and I lean on them when

126
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,080
I'm lonely so it's not a big deal but

127
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,840
the tough call is at the same time this

128
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,919
isn't personal this is a job you know

129
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,039
this is a business our responsibility is

130
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,400
to be The Shepherd of the Investments

131
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,600
financially like the money we raise as

132
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,039
well as the people we hire the true nor

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,680
should always be is it the right thing

134
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,440
for the business and then everything

135
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,000
else is explainable and makes sense you

136
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,720
know I like to say we're an a company we

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,800
deserve a people why would you settle

138
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,840
for anything less like why you now if

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,880
you're an a you get A's you you are an a

140
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,960
you act like an A and you're higher a by

141
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,000
the way a a people want to work with a

142
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,199
people so you got to make the tough call

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,280
decisions at age get more expensive with

144
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,280
time so make them quickly

145
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,000
do you use cenly to book calls todoist

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,720
to manage tasks Trello to keep track of

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
projects what if I told you that you

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
could do all these with one tool but

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,160
then it also integrates with all of the

150
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,199
tools that I just mentioned hi everyone

151
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,759
I'm Hannah from the EO team and I'm here

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
to introduce the gamechanging

153
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,240
productivity tool akif flow it's

154
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,120
basically a smart combination of all the

155
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,360
essential productivity features I need

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,759
on the daily first is the beautiful

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,479
marriage of task management and time

158
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,319
blocking akif flow has this interface

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,240
where you can create a to-do list just

160
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,560
as you would in any task management

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,680
tools but you can also drag these

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
certain tasks right into your calendar

163
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,680
to the exact time of day I find this

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,080
particular visualization of todos and

165
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,639
schedules side by side very helpful in

166
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,919
prioritizing my work carving out chunks

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
of focus time needed for video editing

168
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,520
blocking time here syncs with all of my

169
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,520
other connected apps such as slack Ken

170
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,160
Lee and more secondly it's the magical

171
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,000
command bar the go-to shortcut for all

172
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,039
features within akif flow instead of

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,120
navigating the app manually I simply

174
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,520
click on the command bar to command what

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
I wish to perform for example let's just

176
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
say that we confirmed an interview

177
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880
filming and I want to put that in my

178
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,919
calendar I could just set that up

179
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,000
manually on a Google Calendar or I could

180
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
simply go ahead and type akif flow

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,960
founder interview filming on October

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,880
28th from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. and

183
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,720
there's my schedule we've been using it

184
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,880
to keep track of our hectic filming and

185
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,880
traveling schedules every

186
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,759
day say most effective is to be in given

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,759
my experience in sales nearly 30 years

188
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,960
is to be an informed seller a lot of

189
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,800
sales is not how slick can you be in

190
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,120
your presentation it's much more what do

191
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,759
I need to know what can I question or

192
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,080
get out of my Prospect and customer to

193
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,160
be relevant and so I think the biggest

194
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,400
job in sales is actually being informed

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,560
or asking the questions to help them

196
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,800
solve their problems as much as you can

197
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,840
know the more responsible you'd be in

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,639
your Outreach and personalizing your

199
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,639
Communication channel in the ensuing

200
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,680
message if you're asking me how do I

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,680
relate to our customers that's really

202
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,080
just back to the be curious and ask

203
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,240
questions most people proclivity is to

204
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,440
react first really you should listen and

205
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,960
ask more and lastly on you know asking

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,520
questions you got to care too many

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,440
people ask the question don't care and

208
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,160
don't deliver a result and if you care

209
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,000
for your customer you'll inevitably

210
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
build a better product that delivers

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
better results entering a new market

212
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Market sort of being a young team you

213
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,840
need to be different somehow some way

214
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,840
and you need to appeal emotional aspect

215
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,879
of why people buy not the feature

216
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,599
function people react to emotions the

217
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,000
brain works that way and what is your

218
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,960
purpose as a company what are you

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,159
delivering the why someone would

220
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,919
consider the new Acme company and so

221
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,000
you've got to strike a chord and you're

222
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,240
messaging why 6 cents or why new Acme Co

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,759
reduce to the core and simplify your

224
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,639
focus what resonates with the customer

225
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,960
why do they buy your product or service

226
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,840
I think in past experiences challenges

227
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,560
seem to be similar and have a history of

228
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,960
repeating themselves how do we bring

229
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
these products to Market what are the

230
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,759
challenges in growing the company there

231
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,599
are patterns we have people problems

232
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,159
product Market fit issues financing

233
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,159
issues ETC but what I've learned is sort

234
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,120
of remain calm these are normal I've

235
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,759
learned to ask more questions that helps

236
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,400
us get to the root of problems as we're

237
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,960
trying to solve any of those matters

238
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,039
patience for sure is a virtue exercise

239
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
calm in the storm so that people

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,719
understand that leadership and that

241
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,320
resolve uh it's a big worlds leverage

242
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,959
your network learn listen be humble

243
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,640
probably the best thing I can say and

244
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,080
have fun doing it that should guide you

245
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,080
and teach you

246
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,010
