00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,919
you try to go like

134
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,880
this all right just make sure don't hit

135
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,800
your eye right here okay so I'll show

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,240
you just like this you're going just

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,840
toss it and just let oh my God all right

138
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,800
but don't drop in the floor cuz we going

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,280
use this to eat oh God okay yeah so a

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,880
tin and then it's going to flip and then

141
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,520
going I'm going to do it like play bypl

142
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,680
here like Red Zone like that and then

143
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,440
it's going to spin yeah but don't do it

144
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,039
too hard cuz it will either go that way

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,599
right in the middle or right towards you

146
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,759
I'll do it gentle yeah so have it like

147
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,039
this the goal like a gentle and is it

148
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,199
better if it falls on the stove like on

149
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,560
the stove make sure you don't grab it

150
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,280
I'll grab it if it falls on the stove

151
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,280
okay got don't burn yourself

152
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
oh yeah they hit him though that's okay

153
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,720
okay one more try just flip it it's a

154
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,639
little more easier you can do that you
