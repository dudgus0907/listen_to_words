00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,900
First in the tank is a modern revamp of

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,800
a stale product.

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,720
>> Hi Sharks. I'm Leslie and this is my

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
husband Greg. We're from Short Hills,

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,960
New Jersey, and we're seeking $1 million

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,440
for 6% equity in our business.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,480
>> Hello.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,719
>> Wow.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,239
>> Sharks, picture this. It's the perfect

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,440
beach day, and you can't wait to dig

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,600
your toes into the sand.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,840
>> You put on your favorite beach outfit.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
You go to dig out your beach gear, and

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,960
then,

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
>> oh no,

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,120
clunky,

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,000
outdated, uninspired.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,359
Beach gear hasn't changed for a hundred

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
years. True.

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,440
>> Until now.

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Introducing

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
>> Sunflow.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,720
>> Sunflow, a completely reimagined premium

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,040
beach chair that opens big and

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
comfortable, but closes small with just

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
the push of a button.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,840
>> With both fashion and function in mind,

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
we also created thoughtful accessories

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,479
like

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,119
>> our water resistant dry bag to protect

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,280
your precious mobile phone. smart. A

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
drink holder that rotates and adjusts to

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
fit all different size beverages.

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,040
>> And Leslie's favorite accessory,

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,439
>> a double panel canopy that protects your

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,759
skin from 98% of the sun's harmful rays.

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,759
Clever.

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
>> You just recline and you're all set.

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
>> Ready to pack up?

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,040
>> Just push the top button and collapse

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
it.

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
>> Nice.

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,040
>> Voila. You're good to go.

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,520
>> Impressive. So, sharks, who wants to

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,399
swim to shore and help Sunflow make

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,560
every day a beach day?

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
>> I'd like to buy a dozen of them. How did

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,759
you come up with the idea that let's

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
make a great beach chair?

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,680
>> Did you have background?

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,759
>> Are you an engineer? No, but I'm I'm a

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
handbag designer. So, we started a

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
fashion line of handbags right after we

57
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,720
got married.

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,280
>> We were partners in that business for

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
many years. We actually had to learn the

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
process of sketching something, right?

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
finding the factory, finding the

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
materials.

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,440
>> Now would be the time to tell us the

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
phenomenal sales numbers, which I'm sure

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,720
is going to blow all of us away

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
>> because there is a 16 million pound

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,599
elephant in the room.

68
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,720
>> That's your valuation. Um, we launched

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,400
13 and 12 months ago. Uh, we have 2.9

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
million in sales.

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
>> Wow.

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
>> Um, we're on track to grow 409% this

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
year.

74
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
>> Talk us through the distribution. Where

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
did you sell that direct?

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,319
>> 100% direct to consumer. We haven't even

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,000
touched any yet. That's great.

78
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,680
Congratulations. What do you sell them

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
for? What's your cost?

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,080
>> We are selling the product. The chair

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,080
itself is 198.

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
>> That chair retails for 198.

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
>> 198 without the accessories.

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,599
>> Seems it seems high.

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,800
>> 60% of our customers buy every single

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,959
chair accessory.

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,720
>> Let's break down the numbers. 198 for

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,480
the chair, 48 for the sun shade, 25 for

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
the drink holder, 25 for the dry.

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
>> What's the margin on this piece of

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,840
plastic when you sell for 25 bucks? That

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,239
is 78% margin.

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
>> Wow.

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,959
>> What does it cost for you to make one

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,599
chair that you're selling?

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,360
>> Uh $70 to make a chair landed, but we

97
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,000
sell three accessories for every chair

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,799
we sell. So, we have sold 11,000 chairs,

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,519
but 44,000 units have sold.

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,440
>> Your numbers blow me away. Amazing.

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,720
Leslie, what drove you to become

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,000
entrepreneurs?

103
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,560
>> Um, so my parents immigrated from Taiwan

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,760
50 years ago. They're very um proud of

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
the fact that they came here with

106
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
nothing but a little piece of gold in

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,879
the bottom of their toothpaste tube.

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,159
>> So I watched them both work really hard.

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,840
And my father um actually was an

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,400
entrepreneur. He started a business in

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
the basement of our house. He started a

112
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,040
construction company and he built it to

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,519
be a multi-million dollar company. Wow.

114
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,200
And he was we're so proud of him. and he

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
actually passed away a little over a

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
week ago.

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,879
>> Oh, no. I'm sorry.

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,560
>> Um, so to be here is very special.

119
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
>> Sorry to hear that. That's too bad.

120
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
>> Yeah, I'm sorry.

121
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
>> No, but he'd be so proud.

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
>> Back to our reality here. Let's talk

123
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
about these numbers here. Um, I give you

124
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
a million dollars for 6%. I'd have to

125
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,960
see 32 million valuation on this

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
company, let's say, in the next 24

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,199
months, 36 months to even get a chance

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479
to double my money. Well, if you only

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,320
double your money, I'd be really

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
disappointed. This is an enormous

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,040
market. The outdoor market

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,800
>> just on a beach chair.

133
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
>> No, I have so many products in the

134
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
pipeline. I'm already developing a

135
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,280
higher chair that's, you know, a lot of

136
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
people requested it. I started

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
developing that 3 years ago.

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,720
>> I was going to ask you about a longer

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,160
chair.

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
>> Yes, it's going to We were talking about

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
a lounger and I have an amazing table

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
that's coming.

143
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,280
>> We've expanded beyond just chairs. We

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
are building a beach brand.

145
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
>> I love your relationship. Very good

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
energy. Your dad's immigrant story

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,759
resonated a lot with me with your

148
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
father. My dad only went third grade in

149
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,800
school because after that he was sent to

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,880
a concentration camp and he had so much

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
joy with my mom of seeing me go to the

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,199
first person in our generation to go to

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,880
college and graduate school. And I feel

154
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
that your dad is here with us and so is

155
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,479
my dad. And so I like all of that.

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,840
Here's my offer. I would give you the

157
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:30,360
million dollars. I was going to say 25%,

158
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,360
but I'm going to say 22 and a2%.

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
>> Thank you. I want to go back to

160
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,600
something Kevin asked. How do you make

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
money? This will be one of the most

162
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
successful businesses from Shark Tank.

163
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
And I'm not saying that because I'm

164
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,039
arrogant, and I hope you could see we're

165
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
we're humble.

166
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,320
>> You seem humble.

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
>> Thank you.

168
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,800
>> I would go that far, but Okay, go ahead.

169
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
>> No, she's pretty humble.

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
>> This is going to be a hundred million

171
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,199
plus business.

172
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
>> Okay, let's let's stop there because

173
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,560
that's a great talking point. Yeah. But

174
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,639
the number that matters as it relates to

175
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
valuation based off of what you've um

176
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,600
offered us is $16 million in

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
distributable cash. When will you have

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,880
$16 million in distributable cash?

179
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
Because 6% of that is $1 million. Of

180
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,840
course,

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
>> that's how we only not even a return.

182
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,759
>> That's just to get our money back. When

183
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,199
I talk about scaling a company, it

184
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
really has to scale.

185
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,280
>> Leslie and Greg, I gave you an offer.

186
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,680
>> Do you guys want to accept it or

187
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,120
counter? We

188
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,120
will respond to both. We hope that if

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,520
any or all of you invest that you're

190
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
along for the ride. This isn't a goal to

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
distribute money a year from now.

192
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
>> I didn't say when. I just said it all.

193
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
>> Well, I'm getting a little bit impatient

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
though. I might go hang out at the

195
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,840
beach.

196
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
>> We're not even close. So, I don't want

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
to.

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
>> Do you want a counter?

199
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,759
>> Uh, just

200
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,479
>> because it's not just a million dollar.

201
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
It's millions of dollars in time from my

202
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,759
team and from myself. I've seen what it

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
takes. I I'd like to invest in this

204
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,080
business, but it's so far stretched. A

205
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
million bucks is still a million bucks.

206
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,039
>> Go ahead and counter, Greg.

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,280
>> This year, we're going to do close to 4

208
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
million. Next year, our goal is to do 10

209
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,960
million. And we're estimating a 20% net

210
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,280
income. So, $2 million. Multiples on

211
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
this in this industry are 22 times right

212
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,720
now. So, we believe our business will be

213
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,280
worth $44 million unrealized.

214
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
>> Hey, Greg and Leslie, you're answering a

215
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,639
lot of questions. I ran out of patience.

216
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,639
I waited for you to give me a counter.

217
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,479
You could have given me a counter. You

218
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,840
want to give me a counter. I'm out.

219
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,319
>> Hey guys, I'll clear I'll clear the

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
deck, too.

221
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
>> It's a great business for you, but it's

222
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
not something I want to invest in. I'm

223
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
out.

224
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
>> Okay.

225
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,520
>> I think you're overconfident, and I wish

226
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,319
I would share that confidence with you,

227
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,039
but because I don't I don't believe it,

228
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm out.

229
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,840
>> You did come in at a very high

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,800
valuation. You you did rocket sales

231
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,759
fast, which is great, but also sometimes

232
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,840
that can slow. So, unfortunately, I'm

233
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,520
out.

234
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
>> Okay, we understand.

235
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,199
>> All roads lead to

236
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,199
>> All roads lead back to Mr. Wonderful. As

237
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,199
usual,

238
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,400
four sharks are out. Kevin is Lesie and

239
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,639
Greg's last hope for a deal for their

240
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
beach chair company, Sunflow.

241
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
>> I'm struggling like all the other sharks

242
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
are in the valuation and just the

243
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
returns. Understand?

244
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,879
>> Okay. And you are in the Shark Tank. So,

245
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,840
here's my offer.

246
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,680
>> I'll do the million bucks. Okay. I'll

247
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,680
take a 4% equity position. All right.

248
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,719
Less than you're offering me, but I want

249
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,360
five bucks a chair on a royalty until I

250
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
recoup $2 million. All right. Then the

251
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
royalty goes away and I stay your

252
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,920
partner at 4%.

253
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
I knew that would

254
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
>> Yeah. Well,

255
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,360
>> I would say ouch on that one.

256
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
>> No, that's not as bad as it sounds.

257
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,959
>> I think it's too aggressive though to

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>> uh $2 million return to you. Um after

259
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
>> all I wanted was to double my money.

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
>> Yeah. So, can I counter?

261
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,320
>> Sure.

262
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,120
>> Yeah. So the 4% equity, but instead of

263
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,480
$5 per chair, up to two million, up to 1

264
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
million, so that you're no longer at

265
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
risk that then when we've paid you back,

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
you're our ongoing partner.

267
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
>> So my if you say no to that, you're

268
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
crazy.

269
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,959
>> With no chance of a return other than

270
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
one day getting an exit with a 4%

271
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,040
position. That's basically what you're

272
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,680
offering me,

273
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,080
>> Kevin. It's actually not a bad offer.

274
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,959
It's pretty bad because the 6% he he has

275
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
>> No, it's not bad.

276
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
>> Has half of his equity for this.

277
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
>> It's not bad at all. I'm shocked that he

278
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
offered it.

279
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,480
>> I'm willing to be flexible. I'll do your

280
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,040
deal if you get me back to the 6%. I

281
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
give you my million dollars. I'm your 6%

282
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
partner, but I get nothing back in my

283
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
cash except the return of it on the

284
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,040
royalty at $5 a share. I'll do that

285
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
deal.

286
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,680
Okay.

287
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,800
5%

288
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,080
and and we pay you back the $5 per chair

289
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,080
till we get to a million and we have a

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,080
deal.

291
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
>> Done.

292
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,200
>> There you go, Kevin. Good job.

293
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
>> Congratulations, guys.

294
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
>> Thank you.

295
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
>> Congratulations. A phenomenal

296
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,320
presentation.

297
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,360
>> Sure.

298
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
>> Thank you so much.

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,519
>> Congratulations, guys. Good luck.

300
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,519
>> Thank you. Thank you.

301
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
>> Wow. I know my dad's watching right now

302
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,959
and just knowing that you could take a

303
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,519
dream and make it into something, you

304
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,760
know, a reality. It's it's uh it's

305
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,510
something I watched him do and now we're

306
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,720
doing it.

307
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,880
[Applause]

308
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,110
Next into the tank is an affordable way

309
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:48,160
to enjoy a luxury.

310
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:50,320
[Music]

311
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,079
Hi Sharks. My name is Tommy Pristella

312
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
and I'm an Air Force pilot from Sandy

313
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,480
Miss California. I'm here today seeking

314
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,800
$100,000 for 25% of my company. Now

315
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
Sharks, I love summer days as much as

316
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,399
the next guy. What's not to love, right?

317
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
I mean, backyard barbecues, evening

318
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,839
baseball games, I love it all. But

319
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
sharks, there's one thing about summer

320
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,079
that I just really don't like.

321
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
>> Uh-oh.

322
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,519
>> It's freaking hot.

323
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
And if you've been stationed in the deep

324
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
south like I have for the last 12 years

325
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
or deployed overseas to Iraq,

326
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,959
Afghanistan, Africa, you know that those

327
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,640
places get crazy hot. I got sick and

328
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,880
tired of sweating through my clothes

329
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
every time I stepped outside and just

330
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,519
always being uncomfortable.

331
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,839
>> So, I fused together a creative way to

332
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,360
stay cool and beat the summer heat.

333
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
Sharks, you guys ready to cool off?

334
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,959
>> Yeah.

335
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,079
>> Yeah, sure.

336
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,480
>> Introducing the one and only pickup

337
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
pool.

338
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Sharks. As you can see, the pickup pool

339
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
is the ultimate truck bed swimming pool.

340
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,600
This patented pool liner instantly

341
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,760
transforms the bed of your pickup truck

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
into an above ground pool. Simply pull

343
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,000
the corners of the pickup pool over the

344
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,480
corners of your truck bed. Add water and

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,839
bam, you're ready for a pool party.

346
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
>> When you're done, there's a drain at the

347
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,800
back. You can drain the water without

348
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,519
lowering your tailgate.

349
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
>> I like it.

350
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,600
>> No sharks. The Pika Pool is a brand new

351
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
product in an untapped market. So, what

352
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,079
do you say? Who wants to go for a swim

353
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,519
and make a deal with takeup pool?

354
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,680
>> How did you come up with this?

355
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
>> My inspiration was my daughter.

356
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
>> A

357
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
>> way back when when I got the idea for

358
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,480
this, we were living in Arkansas. It's

359
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,680
2014, crazy hot summer. And my daughter

360
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
says, "Daddy, I want to go swimming."

361
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
And I'm like, I'm heartbroken and she's

362
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,959
heartbroken because I don't have a

363
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
swimming pool. So I was like, well a

364
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,000
>> I was like, let's see what I can do. I

365
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,600
go in the garage. I'd seen it done

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
before. I was we'll get a tarp. I got

367
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,120
some bungee cords. I make this thing in

368
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
the back of my truck and it's it worked

369
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
but it was an ugly mess.

370
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,480
>> And what if it leaks?

371
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,320
>> These do not leak. These are very thick,

372
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
durable material. Lifetime guarantee on

373
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
them. It's the same stuff above ground

374
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
pool liners are that last 30 years.

375
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,839
>> Yeah. Wow.

376
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
>> Good for you, Tommy. First of all, thank

377
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,519
you for your service.

378
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,480
>> Hey, it's my pleasure.

379
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,720
>> What's the patent for?

380
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
>> So, the patent is it's the adaptable

381
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,320
watertight barrier. I'm the only person

382
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,279
who can make the bed of the pickup truck

383
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,639
watertight.

384
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,639
>> So, where are you selling these now?

385
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
>> So, I sell them mainly online.

386
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,680
>> How much do you sell them for? So they

387
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,920
cost me 110 and 117 to make for the two

388
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,600
sizes and then I sell them through my

389
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,639
website for $2 and210 respectively. How

390
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,519
much have you sold

391
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,519
>> year to date? $7,60.

392
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,360
>> Killing it, huh?

393
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,560
>> Killing it. Lifetime sales $12,000.

394
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,839
But there's a story there.

395
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,839
>> What's the story?

396
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,079
>> I got the idea 2014. Did a proof of

397
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,000
concept in 2015. Bought 20 pools.

398
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,279
Immediately I got the website up. I'm

399
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,040
getting hits on the website and I'm

400
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,800
like, people really like this. I sell

401
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
those 20. I go back to get more

402
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,639
manufacturer retired.

403
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
>> That sucks.

404
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,120
>> So now I'm back at square one with

405
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,880
nobody to make the pools. So 2016's

406
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,000
pretty much gone me looking for a

407
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,839
manufacturer. 2017 deployed to

408
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,519
undisclosed location in Africa, but I

409
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
had to obviously hit the brakes on

410
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
pickup pools cuz I was a oneman show at

411
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,639
the time. So I brought my sister on,

412
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,399
very responsible. Love my sister to

413
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
death. She found me. the manufacturer

414
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,480
makes this. She She's part owner. She's

415
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
got a percentage of the company as well.

416
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,240
>> That's not her in there, right?

417
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,800
>> No. So, can I talk about her? That's my

418
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,959
beautiful wife of 12 years right there.

419
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,320
>> So, so supporting me really.

420
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,360
>> Well, who's the guy she's fooling around

421
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
with?

422
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,880
>> She's in a hot tub with some other guy.

423
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
>> Yeah, that's my best friend from

424
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,040
college. That's

425
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,880
>> So, what are you going to do going

426
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,639
forward? What's the plan? So, the reason

427
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,639
I'm asking for money today, I want to

428
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
reju my website and figure out how to

429
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,839
drive traffic to my website. My website

430
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
right now, it it looks nice, but I made

431
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,639
it. I'm not a web developer. I'm really

432
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,160
proud of myself. I made a website. I'm

433
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,760
like, "Wow, I want to have a

434
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,639
professional redo my website." You're

435
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
basically saying you're going to spend

436
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
the money to market the product. The

437
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,000
product's in the market. It's good

438
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,240
quality. 12,000 lifetime sales since the

439
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
beginning is really abysmal.

440
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,839
>> Okay. Well, look at this.

441
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,560
>> The guy gets deployed to an unknown, to

442
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,959
be unnamed place. I get it, but the

443
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
products

444
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,480
>> I got this. Thank you, Mark. I got this

445
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
one.

446
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,600
>> You mean is the only way it can sell is

447
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,600
you, Tommy, are like barking at the

448
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,720
internet. I just don't know if people

449
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,760
care. You've sold $12,000 worth of it.

450
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,240
Like, it's totally 100% increase from

451
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,320
last year, Kevin.

452
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,839
>> True story. Yeah, Tommy.

453
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
>> What do your platoon buddies think of

454
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,399
it?

455
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
>> Oh, they love it. I've actually I've uh

456
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,800
brought it to undisclosed location in

457
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,600
the Middle East. Tommy, who would work

458
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
your business?

459
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,320
>> You're still full-time military?

460
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
>> I I am married to the military for the

461
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,399
next eight years. So, there's no pulling

462
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,680
the wool over your guys' eyes here.

463
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
>> Back to the question, who would work

464
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,800
your business?

465
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,600
>> My sister is the other part of me.

466
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,040
>> Where's she based?

467
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,560
>> She's here in Southern California.

468
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
>> Can you get the price the cost down

469
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
lower?

470
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
>> Thank you for asking that.

471
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,880
>> You're welcome.

472
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,440
>> Yeah, I'm proud to say they're 100% made

473
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
in America.

474
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,399
>> Good. It's part of the reason why it's

475
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,240
so expensive. I want to make it for $25

476
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,440
and sell it for 60. That's where I'm

477
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,000
trying to get with this. I think there's

478
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,880
room to get that done a lot cheaper.

479
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,440
>> Listen, I think you did a good job of

480
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,160
name pickup pools intuitive. You got a

481
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,720
patent. Great job. My problem here is I

482
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,560
have no idea of the market. I believe

483
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
you. It would work and keep people cool,

484
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,040
but I have no idea the market research.

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,480
And for those reasons, I'm out.

486
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,320
>> Tommy, you're a great guy. I really

487
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,839
admire the the effort you've put into

488
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,600
it. I just don't know if there's a

489
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,560
business. You haven't sold very much.

490
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,639
You've got to find a way to get from 20

491
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,839
or 30 to hundreds.

492
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
>> Well, think of the value you're going to

493
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,519
add when you join me, Rob.

494
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,480
>> And then all of a sudden, we have all

495
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,040
those resources.

496
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
>> You're a great sales guy.

497
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,639
>> I'm not jumping in the pool with you.

498
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,639
I'm out.

499
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,120
>> This thing you fill up with water and

500
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,399
then next hour you got to drive

501
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,279
somewhere. Forget it.

502
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,800
>> No, don't don't drive with it. Look, the

503
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,720
product is telling you, Tommy, I don't

504
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,959
think so.

505
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,839
>> I'm out from an undisclosed location.

506
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
>> Copy that.

507
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,480
>> I'm going to make you an offer cuz I

508
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,160
think it's

509
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,360
>> I think I love this product. I

510
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,360
>> see that coming, too.

511
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
>> But I have a few contingencies. Your

512
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,439
sister has to be committed to it.

513
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,120
>> She is.

514
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
>> It has to have a salesman. And I really

515
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,280
have to like your sister.

516
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,280
>> Oh, you're going to love her.

517
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
>> You have to bring the price down to

518
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,079
under 100 bucks.

519
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,160
>> I absolutely think you can. I believe

520
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,799
you. With those contingencies, I'll give

521
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,799
you the 100,000 for 25%.

522
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,799
>> Okay.

523
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
>> Tell me, is there anybody that has a

524
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,319
formal product?

525
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
>> No, sir. No. I am the only person that

526
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,039
that sells this.

527
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
>> And you think your um patent protects

528
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,799
you from anybody else doing it?

529
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
>> Absolutely.

530
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,280
>> I don't think so. Anybody can get a

531
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,880
piece of plastic, throw it in the back

532
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,320
of a truck.

533
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,280
>> I'll offer you a $100,000 for 33%.

534
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,440
>> No contingencies. Recognizing that

535
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,440
you're going to be off quite a bit,

536
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
we'll just work together to get the

537
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,760
price down. I'll also get this to my

538
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,160
guys at Tower Paddle Board. They can get

539
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
out there and start promoting. That's

540
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,919
it. Tommy, let's rock and roll. What do

541
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,919
you think,

542
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
>> Barbara? I love watching you. You have

543
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,120
two offers. I can't believe it.

544
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,799
>> Thank you for that amazing Wait, just

545
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,240
the last time somebody told me he loved

546
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,080
me, he left me and married my sister.

547
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
>> I would never do that. I would never do

548
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,480
that to you.

549
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,840
>> Mark, I I appreciate negotiate that you

550
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,930
understand where I'm coming from.

551
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,240
>> Yeah. Don't negotiate.

552
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,830
[Music]

553
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,160
>> Let's do a deal.

554
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,559
[Applause]

555
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,640
>> We'll have a lot of fun, man.

556
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,039
>> Marry your sister,

557
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
man.

558
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,840
>> Thanks for what you do.

559
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,440
>> I have no idea if the business is going

560
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,880
to work, but it was a great pitch.

561
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
>> Pleasure meeting you guys. Thank you for

562
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
your service.

563
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,760
>> Shakaroo. Thanks, Tommy.

564
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,039
>> Wow. Mark's deal was not necessarily

565
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,480
sweeter in terms of money, but he

566
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,640
understands what my work life is like

567
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,919
and he's he's willing to flex on that.

568
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,260
So, that's why I ended up going with

569
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,120
Mark.

570
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,440
[Applause]

571
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,970
First in the tank is a portable version

572
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:03,280
of a classic game.

573
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:05,600
[Music]

574
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,960
Hey Sharks, I'm Tom Filipini from the

575
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Mile High City and today I'm raising

576
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,919
$150,000

577
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,080
for a 10% stake in my company, Pepper

578
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,600
Pong. I'm here to tell you that the

579
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,360
world's largest racket sport

580
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
uh pingpong

581
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,240
is uh the world the world's largest

582
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,840
racket sport

583
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,160
uh pingpong has become pretty crusty.

584
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:39,200
This old dog was invented in the 1800s

585
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:44,480
and has uh uh and and that was a century

586
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:48,080
before sliced bread. And it shows

587
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,280
It's time to spice things up.

588
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,440
Meet Pepper Pong. Our brand new game

589
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,559
that is fun for all ages and sets up

590
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
anywhere. Roll tape.

591
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,840
Pepper Pong ditches the need for a

592
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,880
dedicated table. Any reasonably flat

593
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,559
surface, including the floor, becomes a

594
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,400
battleground. Our fence expands to fit

595
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,880
any surface and sets up in seconds. No

596
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,080
flimsy clamps.

597
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,200
But the real spice is in the peppers.

598
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Three unique balls designed to be

599
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,039
adaptable to any surface and making

600
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,640
pepper pong easy to learn but very

601
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,760
difficult to master. Low bounce jalapeno

602
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,280
is great for beginners and small tables.

603
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,720
Medium bounce habanero is an all-around

604
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,280
favorite for all table sizes and all

605
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,159
skill levels. And then to really spice

606
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,000
things up, you have the ghost pepper for

607
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:55,520
intense rallies on larger tables. Pepper

608
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,600
Pong is whisper quiet and furniture

609
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,120
friendly, so even mom will be playing

610
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:05,760
ball in the house. So, Sharks, which of

611
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:09,200
you wants to rally this movement and

612
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,240
serve up the spiciest game of our

613
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,720
generation?

614
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,840
>> Good job.

615
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
>> All right. All right.

616
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,240
>> Who's going to play?

617
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
>> So, which which of you wants to come up

618
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
and play Pepper? We'll play doubles. All

619
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,159
right.

620
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,000
>> Come on. Come on.

621
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,120
>> All right. Now,

622
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,240
>> we go.

623
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,320
>> Oh, ace. I think we won.

624
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,200
>> I do, too.

625
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay. So, how many have you sold?

626
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,919
>> We sold about $260,000

627
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
uh worth of product. We we launched less

628
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,320
than a year ago.

629
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
>> Are you selling them mostly on Amazon or

630
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,159
where?

631
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
>> We're only selling on our website. We're

632
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,640
really trying to control the consumer

633
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,559
experience and 100% of our reviews have

634
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
been five star reviews. Wow. Wow. All

635
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,039
All

636
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
>> How many reviews do you have? Four

637
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
reviews.

638
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,600
>> We have about 160 reviews. The cool

639
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,200
thing about it is, you know, ping pong

640
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,520
has some real flaws to it, right? You

641
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
need the big table. You need the gear. I

642
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,679
don't know if you've ever shown up

643
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,120
somewhere where the paddles are broken

644
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
or the balls are cracked like that or

645
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
the

646
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
>> paddles have splinters in them.

647
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,720
>> Exactly. The other big problem with ping

648
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,120
pong is it doesn't level the playing

649
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,960
field. So if one person is good, the

650
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,360
other person is not good, it's a

651
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,559
blowout. And nobody likes blowouts.

652
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,039
>> What do they cost to make? What do you

653
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,440
sell them for?

654
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,760
>> So landed cost is about $20. Yeah,

655
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,760
>> we're selling them for $70.

656
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,280
>> Why so little? Why so little?

657
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,600
>> I thought so much actually. I think we

658
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,840
have some elasticity up to 89 and you

659
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,799
know without much detriment to sales or

660
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
conversion rates. So

661
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,760
>> you got you got room on price and Tom

662
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,039
you got to tell me what's your

663
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,840
background and how did you come up with

664
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,480
Pepper Pong?

665
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,799
>> It's it's actually a very uh interesting

666
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,840
and personal story. Um so I've had a

667
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,640
long career of success uh in business.

668
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,640
In my mid20s I started a a travel large

669
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,760
travel company. It was a well-known

670
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,240
brand. Unfortunately, I was afflicted

671
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:58,320
with uh alcohol, alcoholism for a number

672
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,679
of years. And after my successes, I

673
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,159
found quite a bit of failure. I was able

674
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,720
to become sober in 2016.

675
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,880
>> Good for you.

676
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,880
>> With the amazing support of my wife and

677
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,200
my my three beautiful daughters who I

678
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
almost frankly almost lost lost

679
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,760
everything else financially was

680
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,240
devastating for me. But I bounced back.

681
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,559
have had no relapses since. I feel like

682
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,840
I was shot out of a cannon. This is

683
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,440
truly my passion project.

684
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
>> So, are you the only investor? Is that

685
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,360
you?

686
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,320
>> Yes, it's only it's only me.

687
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,039
>> How much money you have? How much did

688
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,640
you put into it?

689
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,159
>> About $500,000.

690
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
>> Wow. It's really my entire life story in

691
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,559
a product.

692
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,000
>> Well, did you make your own molds?

693
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,559
>> Yeah, because what what was this

694
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
$500,000? Because we have Yeah,

695
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,919
>> that was a big cost for you because it's

696
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
probably a multi-avity mold.

697
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,200
>> Yeah, it's a multi-avity mold. They're

698
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,159
expensive. You know, we've got a good

699
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,080
amount of inventory. So, um, so a little

700
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
under 10,000 units remaining right now.

701
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,840
>> Do you know what your customer

702
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,480
acquisition cost is?

703
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,919
>> It's about 21 $222.

704
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
>> Basically, you're you're you're giving

705
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,000
up a majority of your margin to acquire

706
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
that customer, but they only buy one

707
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,360
game. They don't buy multiple games.

708
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
>> Well, we're actually seeing a tremendous

709
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,440
amount of repeat purchases because why?

710
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Because because gifting this is a

711
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,520
massively popular gift.

712
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,360
>> Tom, take us through your sales and your

713
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,520
profitability since you started. Yeah.

714
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,080
So, we really started selling in earnest

715
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,799
last fall.

716
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
>> Okay. Last fall.

717
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,120
>> Yeah. And we did $160,000 of net sales.

718
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
>> Got it. And you're on track this year to

719
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,200
do how many sales?

720
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,919
>> Between 600 and $800,000. But this will

721
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,679
be a generation defining game. And it's

722
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,480
patented. So,

723
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,400
id about it.

724
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,720
>> So, the the fence is the is the is the

725
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,840
patent.

726
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
>> It's a foldable fence.

727
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
>> Yep.

728
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
>> What do you need the money for?

729
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
>> We we need a second mold, I believe, at

730
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
some point to double output production.

731
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,520
But that's not,

732
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,640
>> you know, that's one of the biggest

733
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,520
lessons that entrepreneurs have to um

734
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,320
learn and mistake they make often. So,

735
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,919
you really should go slowly. Don't start

736
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,080
another mold, which is close to

737
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,360
$100,000. Go step by step.

738
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
>> Walk run.

739
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
>> Yeah.

740
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,279
>> So, anyway, I think it's very fun, but I

741
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,039
don't think it's the right journey for

742
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,159
me. So, I'm sorry. I'm out.

743
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,320
>> Thanks, Lori.

744
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,279
>> Um, it sounds like it's getting some

745
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,720
traction. But it boils down to, well,

746
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,880
how much of a royalty do I want to put

747
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,960
on it? How do I ever get back my cash? I

748
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,720
want to make 5x on that. It's not

749
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,880
grabbing me by the ping pong balls.

750
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,559
Listen, I've enjoyed the presentation. I

751
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,240
I think it actually has proven itself

752
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,840
and now it's about how the gasoline gets

753
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,240
poured on it. But for me, I'm out.

754
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,320
>> Tom, look, what you've done is great.

755
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,400
your personal journey. I mean, just to

756
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,159
go from where you are with your family,

757
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,320
to take the step and just have the

758
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,480
confidence to keep on pushing forward is

759
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,799
amazing. You deserve a ton of credit,

760
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,799
but this is who you are. This is your

761
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,200
identity. And those types of businesses

762
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,799
are really difficult to invest in. I

763
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,720
think you'll be great on your own, but

764
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,440
for those reasons, I'm out.

765
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,520
>> Tom, my my question is just how you feel

766
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,480
about retail. That's where I kind of be

767
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,080
interested. I think I'm really

768
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,279
interested in your story. I mean, to

769
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,360
come out here and be vulnerable and talk

770
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,120
about sobriety, I I I haven't had a

771
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,799
drink in 2 years.

772
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,640
>> I didn't have Thank you. I kept saying,

773
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,640
"Oh, dry January. Couldn't make it past

774
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,080
dry January." And I looked at my life. I

775
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,440
said, "I got over cancer. I got out of

776
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,960
the clutches of drug dealers in the

777
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
hood, but I can't get away from just

778
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,679
doing this. You know, you went through

779
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,120
that dark stage." Yep.

780
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,400
>> Right. So, welcome back.

781
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,640
>> Hope you're feeling the same way.

782
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,320
>> I'm feeling absolutely amazing about it.

783
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,840
Um, I'll give you the 150K. Uh, but my

784
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,120
idea is to help you with the retail

785
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,600
side, but I want 30%.

786
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,159
>> Woo. But I think the Todd is still in

787
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
the deal.

788
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,600
>> Yeah, I'm still in the deal. Um, Todd,

789
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,039
>> I've read about your background.

790
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,960
>> Come in and save the day.

791
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,679
>> I could see these at every raising canes

792
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
just as a as a as a as a customer

793
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
entertainment vehicle.

794
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
>> I love uh ping pong. Like actually, I

795
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,159
did a collaboration restaurant with my

796
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,000
friend Post Malone. I'm also invested in

797
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,360
a pickle ball team. That's been a great

798
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,640
investment and continues to do better.

799
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,159
And so I love the portability. Um I love

800
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,420
you. So I'm going to make you an offer,

801
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,319
right?

802
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,319
[Music]

803
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,840
Three sharks are out. Tom has an offer

804
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,640
on the table from Damon for his portable

805
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,080
pingpong game, Pepper Pong. But Todd is

806
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,400
also interested. So, I'll give you the

807
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,720
$150,000

808
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,640
and I'll go uh 25%.

809
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
>> Todd, you animal.

810
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,679
>> Why would you undercut me like that?

811
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,679
You're a guest.

812
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,200
>> I I'd love to hear, you know, sort of

813
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,240
your respective visions. Like, how how

814
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,480
could you help me? I mean, that's

815
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,120
obviously a big haircut uh on the equity

816
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
for me.

817
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,799
>> Yeah. No, I I can tell you what what I

818
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,320
can add, right? I told you about the

819
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,919
collaboration with Post Malone at our

820
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,000
restaurant. Our sales went through the

821
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,240
roof. I know how to do these things. and

822
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,919
I'm a social media machine. I got a

823
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,480
whole team behind me that helps me with

824
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,080
these things and I live it every day.

825
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,600
And so I'll get your product out there.

826
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,520
I'll help you expand it for low

827
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,320
acquisition calls. I think that's what I

828
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,399
bring to the table.

829
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,320
>> I believe you. Damon, what's your sort

830
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,960
of vision for how this would play in

831
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
retail?

832
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
>> Well, how would do you think it would

833
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
play in retail?

834
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,320
>> Well, when you sell retail, you know,

835
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,240
you have a difficult time, you know,

836
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,039
bringing your customer into the family,

837
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,559
so to speak.

838
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,080
>> Yes. And I want to bring my customer

839
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,559
into the family, at least in the

840
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,960
beginning, to nurture that relationship,

841
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,440
make them feel part of a movement. So, I

842
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
want to go to retail, but not right out

843
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,960
of the gate.

844
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,320
>> Well, then I I want to be um respectful

845
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,440
of your your dream.

846
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
>> TomTom,

847
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,559
>> I'm in, buddy. You me.

848
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,159
>> Listen, listen. You know,

849
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,279
>> love it. All right, that helps. That

850
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,880
helps. He's

851
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,000
>> You're concerned about retail, which I

852
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,919
can understand that you're building it

853
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,520
up slowly. I think out of respect for

854
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,080
you and your dream, I think that I'm

855
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,960
gonna take my offer off the table. I'm

856
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,399
out.

857
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,760
>> Okay. No, I get it. Um Todd, I I would

858
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,880
love to do a deal with you. I I'm

859
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,760
curious if you'd split the difference

860
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,320
with me down to 17.5%.

861
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,320
>> 17.5 in the spirit of a of a long-term

862
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
partnership.

863
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,480
>> Let's go 20 and you got yourself a deal.

864
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,490
>> Could you go just 19 just

865
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,200
psychologically?

867
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,520
Why not? All right, let's do it.

868
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,200
>> Let's go, man.

869
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
>> I guess we're going to do it, baby.

870
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,720
You're going to build it. It's going to

871
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,520
be great.

872
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480

I believe Pepper Pong is going to make a

878
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
big difference in the world, not just

879
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,600
for fun, but as a way to inspire people

880
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,520
to go do great things and to be

881
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,480
vulnerable and to connect with other

882
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,399
people and put your phone down and just

883
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,090
build relationships through the joy of

884

Hey, I'm Chris Rutder and my company is

887
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,520
Spikeball. I'm here in San Diego today

888
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,960
for a spikeball tournament. We've got 45

889
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,559
teams and they are psyched to play

890
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,960
today. The way I like to describe

891
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,640
spikeball is if volleyball and floor

892
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,399
square had a baby, it would be called

893
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,080
spikeball.

894
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,679
Spikeball is so much fun because it's so

895
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,919
active. It's so competitive. There's

896
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,679
strategy, a ton of trash talking.

897
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,919
Absolute blast to play. Spikeball

898
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
started as a fun, casual backyard game.

899
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,320
It's becoming a competitive sport,

900
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,840
especially on college campuses.

901
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,919
>> Thanks for coming, everybody. Spikeball.

902
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,520
>> Potential for spikeball is limitless.

903
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,679
There will be sponsors. There will be

904
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,760
professional players. It will be the

905
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,440
next great American sport. I know a lot

906
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,279
of people may think I'm off my rocker by

907
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,640
talking like that, but when we started

908
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,480
this company, people thought we were

909
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,880
crazy as well. And look where we are

910
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,320
today.

911
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
>> That's what you call spike ball.

912
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,200
>> We're hoping to blow spike ball up.

913
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,200
Sharks, I believe, can help us get

914
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,200
there.

915
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:55,690
[Applause]

916
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:55,690
[Music]

917
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,159
Hello Sharks. My name is Chris Rutder

918
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,960
and I'm from Chicago. I'm here today

919
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,440
looking for an investment of $500,000 in

920
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,159
exchange for 10% of my company,

921
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,360
Spikeball. Spikeball is poised to be the

922
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,200
next great American sport. Like all

923
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,360
great sports, spikeball is very easy to

924
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,919
learn but really really difficult to

925
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,720
master. It can be a casual fun backyard

926
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,399
game or it can be hardcore competition.

927
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,799
Another great thing is spikeball is

928
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,720
ultra portable. So all you need is this

929
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,399
ball, that net, and one of these

930
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,320
backpacks and you can take it absolutely

931
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,399
anywhere. So standing to my right here

932
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,399
in the black jerseys is Chico Spike

933
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,559
Ball. They have been the number one

934
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,880
ranked team in the country for over 12

935
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,279
months. These guys are just absolutely

936
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,480
dominating. dominating.

937
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
>> They're going to play a couple points

938
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,279
against Tyro United. Now, you're going

939
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,640
to see in a second they're going to

940
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,640
serve the ball basically just by

941
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,720
bouncing it off the net towards Tyro.

942
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,880
Now, just like in volleyball, Tyro has

943
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,880
up to three hits between each other

944
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
before they have to spike it back on the

945
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,720
net. Now, they of course want to spike

946
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,559
it so Chico can't get to it. If you

947
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,000
can't get it on the net, the other team

948
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,159
gets a point. First team to 21 wins.

949
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,799
Once the ball is in play, there are no

950
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,799
sides. All four players can run

951
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,240
absolutely anywhere they want.

952
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,519
Gentlemen, I'm going to ask the guys to

953
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,519
come out here and play a couple points.

954
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:35,679
[Music]

955
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,760
>> Awesome. Thank you guys.

956
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,840
>> Who invented this game? You?

957
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,559
>> No. Brought it back to life. So, it was

958
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,120
around back in 1989 and one of my good

959
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,960
friends bought it at a toy store and uh

960
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,039
they and my older brother played a bunch

961
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
and absolutely loved it. And about 10

962
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,320
years ago, you know, the light bulb kind

963
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,320
of went off. We went home and kind of

964
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,840
did our homework, found out that the the

965
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,039
product had been off the market for like

966
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,480
15, 20 years.

967
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,919
>> Who owns Spike Ball?

968
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,279
>> We do.

969
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,760
>> How did that happen?

970
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,000
>> Uh their rights were completely expired.

971
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,679
So,

972
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,159
>> and you just reclaimed them.

973
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,480
>> Uh the trademark, yes. There was never a

974
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,760
patent. Has it ever been contested now

975
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,519
that it's successful?

976
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,159
>> No. And we actually did get a utility

977
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,279
patent.

978
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,760
>> Some guy that's going to be watching

979
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,679
this going, "Oh my goodness." You you

980
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,960
mentioned obviously that it's a sport.

981
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
Where can you take it? How big can it

982
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,120
be?

983
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,120
>> It can be huge. So we've got a governing

984
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,559
body called USA Spikeball. So we have

985
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,000
tournaments all over the country.

986
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,679
>> How many tournaments are being played?

987
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,559
>> We'll have about a 100 tournaments this

988
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,600
year.

989
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,600
>> And you charge them.

990
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,120
>> It's a loosely a premium model. We also

991
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,399
sell memberships. And how did you

992
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,039
>> Wait, wait, wait. It sells memberships.

993
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,880
Tell us about that.

994
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,880
>> Yes. So you can buy a quote baller

995
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,600
membership on USA spike ball.

996
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,039
>> Say that again.

997
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,159
>> Baller.

998
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,440
>> Are you all ballers?

999
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,279
>> Markers.

1000
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,120
>> Ballers, baby.

1001
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,480
>> What's the the demographic? What's the

1002
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,720
average age that

1003
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,159
>> 18 to 24 male is our sweet spot.

1004
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,120
>> What does one cost?

1005
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,039
>> Uh $59.99 plus shipping.

1006
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,720
>> Can I go to a toy store and buy it?

1007
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,200
>> Some toy stores, yes. We're focusing

1008
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,200
more on uh sporting goods stores. We've

1009
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,960
been around about 6 years. the first 5

1010
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,240
years pure e-commerce.

1011
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,200
>> Chris, how how many units are you

1012
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,399
selling a year?

1013
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,040
>> Uh, this year we've sold 29,000

1014
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,359
units.

1015
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,919
>> And how much do they cost to make?

1016
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,639
>> Uh, a little over $14 a unit. So last

1017
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,280
year your total gross sales $1.4

1018
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,879
million. And this year you expect it to

1019
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,320
be around three between 32 and 35.

1020
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,679
>> And you've got to be killing it then

1021
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,359
because it's all margin. So what are you

1022
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
what are you netting at the bottom line?

1023
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,359
So last year we netted I want to say

1024
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,320
about 170 180 grand.

1025
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
>> Why so little?

1026
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,879
>> Retail is growing like crazy. So our

1027
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,240
e-commerce business is good, but retail

1028
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,320
is really eating in.

1029
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,119
>> So how much you paying yourself?

1030
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,960
>> Um my salary uh 175.

1031
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,480
>> There you go. Okay, that makes it up.

1032
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,159
Good for you.

1033
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,639
>> Can I go back to one thing? Just the

1034
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,200
price.

1035
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,440
>> Sure.

1036
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,119
>> Can you get your cost down from $14?

1037
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,640
Have you tried that? Where do you think

1038
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,720
it could go to? Um, my I'd love to get

1039
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,839
down to the $10 range.

1040
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
>> Chris, what are you going to use the

1041
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,880
money for?

1042
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
>> Uh, working capital. We're starting to

1043
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,320
get really, really big orders from

1044
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,440
really big retailers.

1045
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,640
>> How big from who? For what?

1046
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,280
>> The biggest we work with is Dick

1047
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,880
Sporting Goods. We've got POS for 10,000

1048
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
units to ship.

1049
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,760
>> Have you done any tests with them to see

1050
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,079
how it sells through the store?

1051
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,400
>> Yeah, our initial test was 100 stores.

1052
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,720
>> You started your test how long ago?

1053
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,839
>> Uh, two months ago. Do they take it to

1054
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,480
more stores each time?

1055
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,160
>> We're in 250 now. So, wait. In 2 months,

1056
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,720
you've gone from 100 to 250.

1057
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,040
>> Yes.

1058
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,640
>> And just in that brown box, I mean, that

1059
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,240
was your Can I see the box?

1060
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,400
>> So, probably word of mouth is getting

1061
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,400
out there. Let's call it a um uh not a

1062
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,440
toy business, but it's a

1063
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
>> it's a sports.

1064
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,599
>> Amen.

1065
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,119
>> Sport

1066
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,640
not sell it in toy stores cuz you have

1067
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,400
to protect your brand and as soon as it

1068
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,680
shows up there, you're just

1069
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,720
>> Would you sell it at Walmart if they

1070
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,280
asked you?

1071
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,920
>> Maybe. Okay. So, dude, dude, so GoPro,

1072
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,839
>> huge fan.

1073
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
>> We do extremely well at Walmart.

1074
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,920
>> Got it. This is the expertise I need.

1075
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,720
>> I would not shy away from that

1076
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,960

1078
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,760

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,920
to 50,000 pre-tax.

1080

1081
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,920
cash flow for a ball in a net.

1082
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,680
>> Ball in a net. That's kind of like

1083
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
calling your baby ugly. I mean, I love

1084
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,000
this. It's a little more.

1085
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,800
>> He just called your baby ugly.

1086
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,680
>> Look, I think the business is worth

1087
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,240
about seven times the cash flow. It's

1088
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,839
worth around 2.5 million bucks. That's

1089
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,760
what I think.

1090
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,200
>> Would you do a deal with a value like

1091
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,359
that on it?

1092
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,200
>> No. I think that's discounting it way

1093
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,880
too much. Um, we have

1094
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,200
>> Let's see if you can I'm going to sit

1095
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,280
back and watch and see how enthusiastic

1096
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,079
another shark might be.

>> Thank you. I think it's very interesting

1099
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,520
what you've done, but not often do I say

1100
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,760
I can't see my way to the valuation, but

1101
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,680
here is one of these where it's like I

1102
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,200
just I don't see it.

1103
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,160

1104
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,560
>> All right. Thank you, Lori.

1105
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,560
>> I I'd say you've got a great opportunity

1106
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,119
to cost reduce this thing. I wouldn't be

1107
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,680
too hung up on your $60 price point.

1108
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,760
>> Okay.

1109
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,400

1110
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,000

1111
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,599

1112
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,599
>> it's not something that I can personally

1113
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,680

1114
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,600
not right for me. I know.

1115
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,800

1117

>> Look, Chris, I'm going to be brutally

1118
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,960
honest with you. When you when you

1119
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,880
walked in, I thought this was going to

1120
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,200
be stupid. If you would have brought

1121
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,720
this to me and just described this to me

1122
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,079
and said, "Mark, would you invest? We're

1123
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,839
going to turn this into 3 million in

1124
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,240
sales. Dick's going to place an order

1125
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,119
for 10,000 units all within a few

1126
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,200
years." I would have said, "Step away

1127
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,119
from the bar." And then if you would

1128
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,440
have said on top of that, you think

1129
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,079
that's bad, we're going to have leagues.

1130
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
>> Absolutely.

1131
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,800
>> I would have said, I'll take what you're

1132
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,520
drinking. But you did it, right? You're

1133
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,839
killing it.

1134
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,839
>> Thank you. Thank you. But you know, I

1135
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,240
can't see my way to a $5 million

1136
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,839
valuation. I can't

1137
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,440
>> you right. Can't I can't I can't I I

1138
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,560
can't. I'm out.

1139
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,560
>> Oh, ouch.

1140
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,400
Three sharks are out. Chris only has two

1141
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,640
more chances to make a deal for his

1142
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,520
backyard game, Spikeball.

1143
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,280
>> So, Chris, I'm impressed. Okay. I'm

1144
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,800
impressed in your articulation of your

1145
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
business and what you've achieved so

1146
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,800
far. You've been very aggressive on the

1147
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,280
valuation of you're very, very

1148
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,640
passionate about being worth a lot and

1149
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
you've run into a lot of roadblocks

1150
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,200
already. all the encouragement from Mark

1151
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,480
and then he goes out. That's just

1152
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,960
ridiculous. So, here's the deal. I'll

1153
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,880
loan you $500,000 because this business

1154
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,680
can now support some debt. I'll take the

1155
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,640
10% equity as a warrant for doing it.

1156
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,839
All right? Um the terms on the debt are

1157
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,280
simple. I'm going to charge you 9%. I'm

1158
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,960
going to work very hard for you to be

1159
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,800
successful

1160
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,960
because the 10% could be worth something

1161
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,280
if you achieve success. And there's

1162
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,440
enough evidence here that you've got a

1163
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,680
bit of a viral thing going on, which I

1164
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,240
find very interesting. So, what do you

1165
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,960
want to do?

1166
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,200
>> Um, I thank you for that. I'd like to

1167
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:34,400
see if Damon, uh, can we have a chat?

1168
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,160
>> Very, very, very smart guy. Um,

1169
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,160
>> I have the same concern that most of the

1170
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,720
other sharks have. The evaluation is not

1171
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,520
spike ball, it's balls with spikes, you

1172
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,320
know. So, here's what I'm thinking. Your

1173
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,040
challenge is making goods and providing

1174
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,400
them to the store, right? I'll give you

1175
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,200
the 500,000 and my agenda will be to

1176
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,680
take that pain away, which is starting

1177
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,520
to do licensing, starting to do

1178
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,320
manufacturing and shipping to the

1179
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,800
stores.

1180
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,800
>> Mhm.

1181
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,839
>> That would be what I would be interested

1182
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,680
in for 25% of the whole company. You'll

1183
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,440
be able to run the sports division.

1184
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,119
You'll be able to run the online sales

1185
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,079
because that's creating your sports

1186
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,800
division.

1187
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,960

1188

>> Value your business at 2 million.

1189
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,440
>> Yes. Um so thank you for that. That's

1190
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,830
that's that's quite rich. Um would you

1191
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,160
consider 500K at 15%.

singing or uh Mark, you want to end the

1252
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,480
campfire in a quick slide the lid back

1253
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,920
on.

1254
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,000
>> Ah, cool.

1255
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,480
>> So,

1256
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,359
>> he's ready to make a smoking deal.

1257
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,960
>> Smoking. Can we see?

1258
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,920
>> Can we get samples?

1259
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,599
>> Got some samples to you.

1260
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,440
>> Yeah. Great puns.

1261
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,880
>> Is there a difference between the tins

1262
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,040
like scents or anything?

1263
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,000
>> They're absolutely absolutely getting

1264
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,599
the original.

1265
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
>> Thank you so much. Lighter, too.

1266
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,440
>> Wa, that's heavy.

1267
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,000
>> Yeah. You want to light it up?

1268
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,599
>> Oh, it's wax. Just on the side

1269
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,720
>> directly on the briquettes.

1270
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,880
>> Oh, you just got to hold it for a little

1271
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,280
bit.

1272
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,599
>> There you go.

1273
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
>> Yeah.

1274
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,640
>> Oh, cool.

1275
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,760
>> Hit a couple of them.

1276
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,200
>> This is Oh, there you go.

1277
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,560
>> Oh, it's really cool.

1278
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,119
>> What do you make it for?

1279
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,800
>> 575. Okay. Wholesale is $1250. It

1280
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,560
retails $25.

1281
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,119
>> How many hours does this burn?

1282
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,560
>> So, this will burn for up to 6 hours.

1283
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,960
>> How much does How much does this weigh?

1284
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,720
>> It's a four pound four pound. Does this

1285
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,480
create ship shipping problems? The fact

1286
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,720
that it's so heavy? So, it costs about

1287
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,040
$950 to ship it in the US for one, but

1288
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,640
it only cost about $13 to ship two.

1289
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,520
>> I want to go back to the burn time

1290
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,560
because it's $25, but you only get 6

1291
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,760
hours burn time.

1292
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,400
>> 6 hours.

1293
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,040
>> So, okay.

1294
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,520
>> Yeah, that's our InstaFire burns

1295
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,640
indefinitely.

1296
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,480
>> It's not that long. So, how does this

1297
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,280
compare to Instafire? A deal that Lori

1298
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,520
and I did.

1299
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,440
>> Instafire is meant to, you know, make a

1300
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,000
traditional type of campfire either in a

1301
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,680
fireplace.

1302
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,880
>> I can just buy I I can bring a tin with

1303
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,640
from my cookies, right?

1304
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,880
>> Instafire is an awesome product. There's

1305
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,240
no question about that. This is built

1306
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,760
for families. Okay? If you want to have

1307
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,640
a campfire in your backyard, you take

1308
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,920
this out, you throw it up.

1309
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,440
>> Why couldn't I just take a tin and put a

1310
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,280
couple Instafiers in there to save save

1311
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,119
some money?

1312
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,680
>> Convenience is a bigger factor. Real

1313
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,040
outdoors people use Instafire. Okay.

1314
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,400
This is a product for a lot of people

1315
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,560
that don't necessarily want to be

1316
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,920
outdoors for days at a time.

1317
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,599
>> Break down the numbers for me.

1318
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,040
>> We've been shipping for 30 days, Rohan.

1319
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,520
We sold,00 units.

1320
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
>> Oh, wow.

1321
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,560
>> We crowdfunded 400 units.

1322
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,400
>> Okay. How much? What was your goal?

1323
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,200
>> $1,000. We're trying to get a proof of

1324
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,040
concept. We've done

1325
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,359
>> So, you've only been in business

1326
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,400
essentially for 30 days and it was a

1327
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,400
crowdfunding campaign.

1328
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,839
>> No, no, just wait a sec. Once we got the

1329
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,839
concept proved and people were

1330
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,520
interested in it, we've sold 600 through

1331
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,040
traditional wholesale retail

1332
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,160
>> where what kind of retail?

1333
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,240
>> Surf shops, camp stores, sporting goods

1334
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,240
stores. My wife and I were vacationing

1335
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,160
even before we were shipping. I had

1336
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,000
samples of it. We went to Kawaii and we

1337
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,119
were using it, taking pictures of it,

1338
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,079
and people were coming up and saying,

1339
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,880
"Oh my god, where'd you get that?

1340
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,319
Where'd you get that?

1341
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,839
>> Okay. Wait, before you jump in that,

1342
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,319
>> guys. Hey guys, we're starting to get a

1343
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,880
lot of smoke. Can you um put a lid on

1344
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,839
it?

1345
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,480
>> Yeah.

1346
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,560
>> Pardon?

1347
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,760
>> In areas where I can't have a fire, like

1348
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,240
a beach or a forest.

1349
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,319
>> Sure.

1350
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,319
>> Am I allowed to light this?

1351
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,480
>> Yeah. In in most instances, what you

1352
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,319
need is a contained fire. Okay. This is

1353
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,920
a contained fire. And so, yeah, you're

1354
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,319
allowed to do it. You can shut it on and

1355
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,520
off just like I I I demonstrated here.

1356
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,880
So, you can have a campfire and

1357
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,680
literally get up and leave and no one

1358
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,359
knows you were there.

1359
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,640
>> What are the other scents? Is that a

1360
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,880
mosquito repelling one?

1361
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,440
>> That's correct. It has a eucalyptus and

1362
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,720
lemon oil in it to repel mosquitoes. And

1363
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
the last one is a samore kit.

1364
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,520
>> A s'more kit.

1365
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,119
>> What about uh a concern I have is the

1366
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,839
heat of the tin. I don't see any warning

1367
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,040
on the tin.

1368
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,560
>> As soon as you open up the tin, there's

1369
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,040
a warning label and instruction manual

1370
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,400
inside.

1371
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,280
>> Okay. So, I'm going to make you an

1372
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,880
offer. All right. I'll give you $50,000

1373
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,319
for 25%.

1374
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
>> Thank you so much for the offer.

1375
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,200
>> Well, you're not going to just say thank

1376
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,160
you because I'd really like to have an

1377
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,760
answer.

1378
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,119
>> Okay, great. You want to tell them that

1379
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,079
the other sales point?

1380
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,760
>> Yeah. Let me

1381
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,440
>> Is this coming to a yes or no?

1382
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,800
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. We just need to

1383
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,200
educate you one more about one more

1384
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,319
feature.

1385
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,520
>> One more feature.

1386
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,599
>> She just made you an offer. What else

1387
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,720
you need to educate her on?

1388
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,680
>> We want her to know what she's getting

1389
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,040
into. Mark, come on.

1390
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
>> Well, that's what you do after you do

1391
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,599
the deal.

1392
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,280
>> Selling time or is it closing time?

1393
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,880
>> Right.

1394
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,040
>> Let me say something, Brad. There's a

1395
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,700
piece of me that is saying you'd be

1396
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,810
really annoying to work with.

1397
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,810
[Applause]

1398
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,560
All Sharks are still in. Brent and Brian

1399
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,640
have one offer on the table from Barber

1400
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,599
for their campfire in a tin product,

1401
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,440
Radiate. However, Brent's personality

1402
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,280
may jeopardize the deal.

1403
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,560
>> There's a piece of me that is saying

1404
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,160
you'd be really annoying to work with.

1405
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,119
So, don't prove me right on that

1406
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,319
instinct.

1407
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,079
>> Guys, I'm going to make it easy for

1408
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,680
Barbara. I think the product's too

1409
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,599
heavy. I don't think it's original

1410
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,000
enough. I think it's a little bit too

1411
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,520
expensive. I just am not all that

1412
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,440
excited about it. And so, for those

1413
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,560
reasons, I'm out.

1414
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,359
>> Okay. Thanks, Mark.

1415
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,000
>> I'm going to make it easier, too. I like

1416
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,800
the concept. Mark and I did Insta Fire

1417
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,200
and it

1418
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,160
>> it's a great product. Instafire burns

1419
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,720
indefinitely and it's safe, all natural,

1420
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,680
and non-toxic. This burns for only 6

1421
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,960
hours. So, I'm sorry. I'm out.

1422
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,839
>> Thanks,

1423
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,359
Sorry to hear that.

1424
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,720
>> Rohan, what are you going to do?

1425
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,760
>> Well, they haven't given Barbara a

1426
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,880
response yet. So, I mean,

1427
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,920
>> well, I think they're waiting to see

1428
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,920
what you're going to do.

1429
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,200
>> Really? Are you out or not?

1430
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,440
>> I'm waiting to see what you're going to

1431
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,800
do.

1432
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,319
>> I'd like them to respond to Barbara. I

1433
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,160
mean, I feel like she got to respect.

1434
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,720
>> No. No. He has an ulterior motive. He

1435
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,000
wants you to respond to me so he could

1436
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,119
give you a worse deal.

1437
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
>> You know, Barbara, I want to work with

1438
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,079
you and and and I don't take it

1439
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,839
personally that you think I'm annoying

1440
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,520
because honestly, I'm not annoying.

1441
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,359
>> You farted before. I just I do what I do

1442
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,640
and I get things done. So, I I don't

1443
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,240
find that annoying. I just find I find

1444
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,800
it honest. Like, I'll tell you what I

1445
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,560
feel and I hope you tell me uh you know

1446
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,000
how you feel.

1447
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,079
>> I find you a little annoying.

1448
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,359
>> That's fine. That's fine. That's fine.

1449
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,040
But at the end of the day, if we're

1450
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,800
working together and you need me to go

1451
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,480
out and pitch somebody, you're going to

1452
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,440
want me to know all the information

1453
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,040
before I make a deal.

1454
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,559
>> Right. Honestly, I have total confidence

1455
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,839
in you as an entrepreneur. You have that

1456
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,240
fire in your belly that I'm always

1457
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,160
looking for. All my great entrepreneurs

1458
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
are annoying in one way. When I used to

1459
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,280
manage sales people, I always knew who

1460
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,319
were going to be the best ones because

1461
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,800
they drove me nuts. Okay, I don't object

1462
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,319
to that.

1463
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,839
>> I actually like your engaging

1464
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,200
personality. I like the fact that you

1465
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,720
got you've intimidated the crap out of

1466
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,480
Robert. He hasn't said anything sitting

1467
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,760
in the corner there.

1468
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,400
>> Robert, you're a boy scout. You've been

1469
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,720
a boy scout.

1470
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,480
>> I was a queen scout. That didn't come

1471
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,680
out right. That didn't come out right.

1472
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,359
>> You want to define that

1473
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,119
>> in Canada

1474
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,720
scout you could be would be a queen

1475
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,319
scout. So it was like an Eagle Scout. I

1476
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,880
just wanted to define that. Anyway, go

1477
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,640
ahead.

1478
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,960
>> Anyway, so um

1479
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,359
>> I I think I have a larger network,

1480
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,040
>> okay,

1481
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,480
>> than Barbara has. I feel that the

1482
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,520
products that I have go in a lot of

1483
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,319
those areas. So, I'll also offer you

1484
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,319
$50,000 for 25%.

1485
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,400
>> And if I could just add something else,

1486
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,800
I have no doubt in my mind that this is

1487
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,880
a winner. The portability of this, the

1488
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,119
size of it, the weight of it, you can

1489
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,880
stack it, it's easy to show in an aisle.

1490
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,680
You don't need an end cop. This is a

1491
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,960
phenomenal product. It's a money maker,

1492
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,960
honey.

1493
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,680
>> I don't see it just in camping goods or

1494
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,880
sporting goods. I see it in gift shops.

1495
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,520
I mean, you've done an amazing job

1496
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,000
>> with this. Mark laughs, but I have this

1497
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,359
in several clothing boutiques that have

1498
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,920
been selling it and reordering.

1499
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:54,319
>> Absolutely. People pay for convenience.

1500
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,400
People pay for cool. I don't find you.

1501
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,440
So,

1502
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,160
>> Robert, is there an offer there?

1503
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,359
>> I find you

1504
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,480
>> Robert, make your offer.

1505
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:04,359
>> I find you quirky. I'll also offer you

1506
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,359
50,000 for 25%.

1507
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,520
>> So, the key to this game is buzz

1508
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,359
building and distribution. Two areas

1509
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,960
that I can bring to bear better than

1510
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,200
anybody else here. You just need a few

1511
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,040
key connections and some great ideas and

1512
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,119
you guys have the energy to punch this

1513
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,440
through. Roan's a great guy. I'm sure he

1514
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,160
can invite you to the best parties and

1515
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,000
you can hang out. It's a business.

1516
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,599
>> Robert has to give you that deal because

1517
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,520
he doesn't have the distribution network

1518
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,359
to help you. That's This is This is

1519
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,040
ridiculous. Now you're just pissing me

1520
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,200
off.

1521
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,880
I I hate to lose and I want to invest

1522
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,280
with you guys and win with you guys.

1523
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,280
I'll give you the 100,000 for 25%.

1524
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,160
>> I've doubled my amount. I'm tired of

1525
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,280
this. This product is going to be huge.

1526
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,559
100,000 for the Queen.

1527
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,440
>> You have the passion for the business.

1528
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,880
We'd like to make a deal with you.

1529
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,280
Yeah,

1530
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,280
>> the queen's cap comes on board.

1531
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,440
>> The new mama. There was not even like,

1532
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,359
"Would you like to come?"

1533
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,480
>> Congratulations, guys. I would have gone

1534
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,880
up. Thank you so much.

1535
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,760
>> Oh, please.

1536
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,040
>> Goodbye, buddy.

1537
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,880
>> That's how it's done.

1538
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,440
>> The waters a little bit.

1539
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,280
>> We went with Robert because he gave us

1540
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,359
the best offer. He was the one that was

1541
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,440
passionate about the product and he made

1542
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,680
it known with his offer. It was easy to

1543
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,200
tell he was the right choice. No,

1544
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,160
there's other way.

1545
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,040
>> Scout rubber.

1546
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,680
>> I like it. Good job.

1547
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,359
>> Come on.

1548
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,480
>> Come on. I

1549
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,720
>> I'll give it to you. I'll give it to

1550
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,119
you,

1551
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,319
>> Rohan. At a certain point, you just piss

1552
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,640
me off.

1553
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,920
>> Desperate. That's what I say. Desperate.

1554
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,480
That was annoying to me. You're

1555
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,000
annoying.

1556
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,240
>> You're annoying.

1557
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,240
>> You're annoying.
