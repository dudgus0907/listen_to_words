1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,560
so I think the one thing that I wish I

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,200
had done differently is I wish I had

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,400
made these pivots faster sometimes you

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
have to change your DNA faster but then

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,920
because you are who you are and you

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,080
don't want to change something that's

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,199
quite core to you that takes a long time

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,000
at least realize that the things that

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,480
you're doing are influenced by who you

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
are and and by the human aspect for

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,599
example we used should focus on drones

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,599
and then we had people that were quite

13
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,640
close to drones companies that we work

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,840
with and then also they spent a long

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,200
time developing the drones cells and the

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,360
drones design and when we say now we

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,640
pivot to EVS we to let go all that all

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,039
the relationships we build with those

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,079
people all the work that we did all the

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
momentum that we build we had to let

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,480
that go and that's not that easy it goes

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,160
back to Pivot when you make a pivot

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,440
there is a risk and the biggest risk is

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,640
you are letting go of something it's

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,079
quite natural for you to be emotionally

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,079
attacked attach to the thing that you're

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,880
trying to let go but you have to let go

28
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:09,320
the sake of growth so I think I wish I

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,560
had let go of momentum the pass the DNA

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,600
faster so that we could actually pivot

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,600
faster my name is CH hul I'm the founder

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,600
and CEO of SCS aai we develop Next

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,040
Generation lithium metal batteries for

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,280
electric transportation both on land and

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
in the air we also use AI to accelerate

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,400
the pace of material Discovery and

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
improve EV safety we've been around for

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,920
more than 10 years we've raised more

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,920
than half a billion dollars now we're

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,320
listed on the lyc and we were the

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,720
world's first to develop Automotive a

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,320
sample and Automotive B sample lithium

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,560
metal sales and we partner with global

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,560
card companies including GM Hyundai and

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,479
Honda so when I was a child I was

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
fascinated by the universe and then in

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,799
terms of anime Transformers just like

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,399
any other kid that grew up in the late '

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,560
80s and the '90s everything that we have

50
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,079
today Once Upon a Time was an

51
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,759
imagination a lot of things in

52
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,920
Transformers for example cars flying

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,480
cars space travel nowadays we are quite

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,360
close to be living in a society where

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,480
you have these things everywhere I was

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,840
fascinated by physics show a lot of my

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,400
time and MIT in undergrad SCI physics

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,560
and then at that time when I started my

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,840
PhD in 2007 2008 it was a very special

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,840
time in the US

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,160
it's the largest lithium ion automotive

62
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,120
battery manufacturing plant in the

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,760
country and today the company A123

64
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,200
Systems will officially open their new

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,360
plant A123 was at the peak I would go to

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,120
these seminars MIT and then just hear

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,440
Founders top Executives at A123 give

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,159
talks about their experience A123 was

69
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,920
the American hero in American Battery

70
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,280
industry but then in 2012 they could not

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,920
compete I think A123 was too early too

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,920
advance for its time they had this lfp

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,560
technology but back in 2009 2010 2012

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,080
the popular Chemistry by the Japanese

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,640
and the Korean companies was not LP it

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,319
was NCM at that time the OEM like GM

77
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,519
Ford they would make A123 and the Korean

78
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,439
and Japanese salemers compete and

79
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,640
obviously A123 could not compete and

80
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,599
they lost and then they went bankrupt so

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,159
founder cosos and professional cosos are

82
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,280
really different founder CEOs are very

83
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,840
technology focused and they really care

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,640
because as like your baby but when you

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,000
are a professional CEO you don't know a

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,720
lot of the the Deep challenges and the

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Deep issues and then you get funding

88
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,319
from the government and then you quickly

89
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,159
forget who you are then their

90
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,879
Professional Management forgot that

91
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,560
because they got a lot of funding and

92
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,640
they thought they could expand really

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,079
fast they hired 5,000 people in 3 months

94
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,680
build this giant Factory in Michigan and

95
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,560
then it was like from the moment they

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,000
announced this build out and the hire 3

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,879
months later they had 5,000 people they

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,680
had just barebone facility and then 3

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,359
months later they had to lay everyone

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
off growth was too inorganic was too

101
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:21,359
fast and if you make one mistake and

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,759
also they lost focus on quality they

103
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,680
were focusing on management focusing on

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
just public marketing they had an issue

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,880
with one of their I think was like a tab

106
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,440
welding those defects cells ended up

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,680
getting shipped to GM obviously that was

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,759
not good so they lost the contract to LG

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,479
so the A123 Professional Management care

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,919
a lot about revenue is a listed company

111
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,479
and revenue is important for your market

112
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,840
cap but they lost focus on the cost it

113
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,039
was huge Revenue with huge negative

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,919
margin just it was not sustainable and

115
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,400
the whole thing blew up I watched the

116
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,600
whole thing and I interface with

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,759
everyone both the founders Professional

118
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,080
Management back then I remember just

119
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:06,800
saying to myself don't let it happen to

120
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,720
CSI end of 2012 after A123 went bankrupt

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,880
because A123 is here in wam at that time

122
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,479
we were just just trying to raise our

123
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,120
series a we had no money so we went to

124
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,120
A123 because we had known those people

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,120
quite well and then their R&D facility

126
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,240
in Wan was was available it used to have

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,120
at the Peak 200 people at that time you

128
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,800
had like eight people and then all the

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,680
dry rooms all the equipment there were

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,520
new sale VR but then everyone's gone so

131
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,240
we went there and we just asked one of

132
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,960
those Engineers hey can you use the line

133
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,919
1865 line and help us build build a

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,720
couple of prototypes for free so they

135
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,039
did that so that was uh end of 2012 like

136
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,280
we would go to A123 and then just

137
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,639
leverage whatever they had and then just

138
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,000
build prototypes all for free looking

139
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,520
back that really saved us a lot of time

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,120
and then a lot of money was a a very

141
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,240
good experience no other battery company

142
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,479
in the US went through that we were the

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,800
only company in Massachusetts at that

144
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,360
time that leveraged that A123 and I

145
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,840
think both that experience leveraging

146
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,240
the A123 incubator learning from A1

147
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,240
123's mistake A123 had a good technology

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
but they expanded too fast they got a

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,520
lot of funding and they almost forgot

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,680
who they were I think one thing is when

151
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,319
the market is is really good we try to

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,160
get as much cash as possible but then we

153
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:36,520
don't don't invest many others for

154
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,800
example in 2022 in 2023 and also I will

155
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,319
say first half of this year when the

156
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,639
market was was actually quite quite hot

157
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,319
a lot of our peers invested a lot if you

158
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,360
go visit our peers in California in

159
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,120
other places I think you'll probably

160
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,360
like their facility more than our

161
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,599
facility we tend to be pretty pretty

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,800
cheap but then a lot of those companies

163
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:00,479
that invested in these things they are

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,560
now shutting it down the market is good

165
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,520
we trying to get as much cash as

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,560
possible which is what we did with the

167
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,840
spa in 2021 and 2022 but we don't invest

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,680
aggressively as many of our here

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,080
especially in CeX because I've seen

170
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,680
companies that spend $100 on cack fire

171
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,400
cell situation will have to sell that

172
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,400
for less than one

173
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,639
cent yes so when you run a company

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,960
especially want to become listed there

175
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,039
is a lot of work that you have to do but

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,080
you also don't have to do you have to do

177
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,680
a lot of work for the sake of of a

178
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,960
shareholders Market investors but those

179
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,199
actually don't really add value to the

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,400
PO Mission I mean I think there are lots

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,120
of challenges we F raise seven times

182
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,879
sometimes Market is good sometimes

183
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
Market is tough and you have to raise

184
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,400
from private investors from Financial

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,599
investors from strategic investors it's

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,360
challenging technology is challenging

187
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,360
deal STS challenging these are okay

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
these are challenges that we have to

189
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,520
deal with I think the biggest challenge

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,800
that I hate the most is um is a bad

191
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,599
board so when you're the CEO of a

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
company there's a board right when

193
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,120
you're private the board is consist of

194
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,479
investors when you have like a bad

195
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
investor that doesn't know anything but

196
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,000
wants to get involved could be this

197
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,440
investor has like a timeline and they

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,120
need to exit or they have say this new

199
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,360
fund and they have pressure from P the

200
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,479
most challenging and then it's the worst

201
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,800
kind of challenge it's not like a worthy

202
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
challenge it's not like technology or

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,760
business deals they're challenging but

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,640
they're interesting and they are worthy

205
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,160
of your time investment I think one you

206
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,560
need to be as an entrepreneur when you

207
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,600
raise money from investors you should be

208
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,399
very selective in the type of investors

209
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,880
some investors maybe it's a big name

210
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,839
investor uh but then if they are too

211
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,920
controlling you want to avoid that a

212
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,880
dollar from a bigname investor is the

213
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,200
same as a dollar from a less known

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,839
investor it's it's really the value of

215
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,279
the dollar and you really want to select

216
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,200
a good board and a good investor

217
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,399
investors that have good chemistry with

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,279
you when you have these agreements

219
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,560
shareholder agreements and the Border

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,120
agreements be really clear with what

221
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,880
kind of power you have and I think um as

222
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,040
entrepreneur now is not a time to be

223
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,959
nice you have to be really clear in

224
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,360
terms of what power the CEO has and then

225
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,680
what power the board has and it's it's

226
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,279
really not the time to be polite if you

227
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,240
don't give me the power don't make me

228
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,800
the CEO make someone else the COO if

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,160
you're going to make me the CEO give me

230
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,040
the power I think that's really

231
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,480
important if you get too complicated

232
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,959
there it's hard to focus especially when

233
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
situations get bad when you have to make

234
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,680
pivots if there is not clear and

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,120
concentrated power it's actually hard to

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,120
make things

237
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,720
happen yes so the current EV Market is

238
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,440
challenging we are in the industry where

239
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,600
the validation process takes a long time

240
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,480
it should be because for someone to buy

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,839
a car and then drive that car with their

242
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,000
family that car should be safe it takes

243
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,760
a long time to qualify a new battery

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,200
chemistry in cars when you change a new

245
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,079
material when you change a new

246
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,440
manufacturing process when you change a

247
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,040
new design it takes a long time to

248
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,680
qualify this is also one of the reasons

249
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,640
why we develop the three AI Solutions so

250
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,079
that we can accelerate that timeline

251
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,880
actually taking 10 years of seeing how

252
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,639
it behaves under different real world

253
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,839
situations let's take one year and then

254
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,720
take all the data from one year play an

255
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,600
AI model and then have that AI model

256
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,680
tell us how it will behave in the next 9

257
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,920
years so I think the the use of AI can

258
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,480
accelerate the time that it takes

259
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,880
customers and the market to get

260
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,000
comfortable with new Innovations the

261
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,399
three AI solutions that we are

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,160
developing AI for science AI for

263
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,680
manufacturing and AI for safety really

264
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,320
start to form a new ecosystem that did

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,600
not exist before and this new ecosystem

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,680
is now forming because you have more

267
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,839
data from all the gigafactories that are

268
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,440
becoming available and also you have all

269
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,279
these new models that are being

270
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,920
developed large language models New

271
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,920
Foundation models and all these new

272
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,959
models that we are developing when these

273
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,959
two converge the data from these

274
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,440
gigafactories and these new models you

275
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,880
can form this really exciting ecosystems

276
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,040
that never existed before and then we

277
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,680
are working with in addition to the car

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,560
companies that we worked with before

279
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Hyundai Honda and and GM we're now

280
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,560
working with computer companies for

281
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,880
example like U Nvidia and and a few

282
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,279
others to really establish very capable

283
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,480
computer centers and also to develop

284
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,760
these new softwares new models that are

285
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,839
tailored to the type of computation that

286
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,760
we're doing so that we can really

287
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,399
efficiently and then quickly compute a

288
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,839
large amount of data from Material data

289
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,279
to manufacturing data to vehicle data I

290
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,480
think we are taking this this Challenge

291
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,760
and then turning this into a very

292
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,279
exciting opportunity where we're forming

293
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,240
a new AI ecosystem in the EV battery

294
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,920
industry that never existed before I am

295
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,120
personally very interested in

296
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,440
transportation related applications

297
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,079
Transportation a that's why EV

298
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,800
Transmission in the air so flying cars I

299
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,560
really believe flying cars will be

300
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
everywhere in 10 years worldwide it's

301
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,120
something I'm very passionate about and

302
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,079
I truly believe in when I was a child I

303
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,680
really like the Greek mythologist of

304
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:44,240
Hermes it was one that brought dreams

305
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,279
and then one application I'm

306
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,880
particularly excited about for the use

307
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,600
of lithium metal is high altitude Pudo

308
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,560
satellites so these are these drones

309
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,600
that fly in the stratosphere so 30,000 m

310
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,920
above the ground and then it's basically

311
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,279
a flying cell tower so you can imagine

312
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,839
these high altitude stud satellites will

313
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,760
fly in remote places and then provide

314
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,000
Wi-Fi provide signals to kids that have

315
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,800
no access to Wi-Fi in terms of the

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,800
spread of knowledge the spread of

317
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,360
information to uh people in remote

318
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,279
places I think it's a very exciting

319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,959
application and also on the material

320
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,680
side we are building bigger and bigger

321
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,720
GPU clusters in the Arctic and this

322
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Arctic Computing Center can power more

323
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,199
and more applications from batteries to

324
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,920
uh for flying cars but also I think is

325
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,480
going to expand Beyond transportation

326
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,920
for example there are many challenges in

327
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,800
climate change you can use this Arctic

328
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,639
Computing Center to address a ocean

329
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,560
plastic waste or to come up with new

330
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:57,519
antibiotics or to come up with new uh

331
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:01,519
models the Earth climate SCSI will uh

332
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,120
evolve from a battery company to power

333
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,639
company for transportation and then also

334
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,639
brain for to address climate

335
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,040
change I think as a human it's it's

336
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,160
quite natural to assign an emotion to

337
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,320
success and emotion to failure but

338
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,399
actually there are just different labels

339
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,680
of different States right I don't really

340
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,759
think too much about about these

341
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,680
failures obviously when these things

342
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,360
happen there is a cost emotionally

343
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,240
financially and whatever really in the

344
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,079
grand scheme of things it's just a state

345
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,120
temporary state I'm not that bothered by

346
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:51,120
those I'm a robot
