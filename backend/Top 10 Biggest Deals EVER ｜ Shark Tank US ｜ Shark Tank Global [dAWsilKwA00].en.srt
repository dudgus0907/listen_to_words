00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,920
All right, guys. Let's do

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,160
this. Next into the tank are young

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,160
entrepreneurs with a beverage for a new

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,160
generation.

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,720
[Music]

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,880
Hey Sharks, my name's Justin Fentel. I'm

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,439
Brad Schultz. And I'm Amy Steedman. And

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
we're from Austin, Texas. Our company is

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,680
Beatbox Beverages and we're seeking

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,719
$200,000 for 10% of our company. Now,

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,200
Kevin, you know wine. So, picture this.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,360
A delightful Cabernet from the Bordeaux

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,039
region of France. It's been Asian oak

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
barrels for 15 years. It's perfect. You

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,840
could almost taste it, right? That's

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,120
true. Bring it over. Well, there's just

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
one problem. Why?

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,199
Boring.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,079
Exactly.

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,400
Now we're getting down. Oh, this is

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,159
Beatbox Beverages and we are not boring.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
We're changing box wine forever with

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,720
flavors like cranberry limeade and blue

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,119
raspberry lemonade. All in one sweet

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,760
looking Beatbox. But it's not just a

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
box, it's an experience. Take Beet Box

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
to your next party and you're instantly

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,520
a legend. Box wine is incredibly

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
popular. It's affordable. It's

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
convenient. It's got a large size where

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
you can share with everyone at the

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
party. But the wine you find inside

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,680
leaves much to be desired. We're using a

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,680
unique orange wine that drinks more like

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
a spirit than a wine and allows us to

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
create mixed drinks that our customers

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
absolutely love. Beatbox is a party in a

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,799
box with almost seven bottles of wine

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
packed into every box. Wow. We've

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
created an innovative, fun brand that's

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
really speaking to our generation, and

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,240
we're ready to take this company to the

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,479
next level. The only question is, will

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,000
the Sharks be joining the Bee Box party?

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,759
Let's try some. Okay. Yeah. What is

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
orange wine? I've never heard of that.

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,840
Yeah. So, orange wine is a is a unique

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,920
wine. It's actually uh clear, much more

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
like a white spirit. The blue one is the

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,560
blue raspberry lemonade. The pink is a

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,200
cranberry limeade. The yellowish color

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,440
is our margarita flavor and the tea is a

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,440
sweet tea. This tastes like

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Oh, are you kidding? This is good. He

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,480
loves it. This is delicious.

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,400
I love this one. Reminds me of those

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
like blue raspberry snow cones. Wait,

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,160
how much alcohol is in here? 11.1%.

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,560
What? Yes. Lori, cheers. Yep. Only 120

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,400
calories per serving and only 7 g of

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
sugar per serving. You know what? I love

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,000
the wine. Kevin, give him the money.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
Tell us more about the business.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,160
Manufactured. What are your margins?

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
Who's actually distributing it? So, we

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,480
self-distributed. We actually um became

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,319
a winery ourselves. the Texas winery,

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,440
you can self-distribute. But we got, you

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,440
know, to the point where we were

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
spending more time in our facility

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
making it, gluing the boxes and

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
distributing it. We couldn't market it,

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,560
right? We're getting too big. So, we

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,159
found a c-acker in Dallas and they now

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,159
make it for us. And we saw a

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,680
distributor. Since then, we've grown our

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,400
sales pretty dramatically. What are your

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,760
sales so far? Just We've done $235,000

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,400
in 14 months, and 120,000 has come in

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
this just this quarter.

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,120
How much money did you raise when you

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,200
started? So, so we self-funded it for

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,640
$55,000. We took on $100 $100,000 in

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
family and friends debt. So, tell me how

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,959
you're going to go from $235 to 5

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,319
million. So, the strategy is to identify

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
new stores where we know it's going to

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
sell. Go into that store and support it

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
with at least six tastings. Tastings are

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
by far the best way for us to get the

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
product out there. What do you need the

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
money for? It's for the engine of

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
growth. Opening up new stores and, you

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,440
know, supporting it with tastings. Our

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
tastings cost on average. So, hiring the

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,959
people $100 per tasting is on average in

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,040
That's expensive. That's expensive.

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,799
Doing it in the stores sounds really,

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,239
really good, but it's really hard to

101
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,400
leverage one store at a time. Even with

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,680
brand ambassadors, your leverage points

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,040
per any one store aren't great. In my

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
mind, the strategy was

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,920
wrong. You know, you need to take

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
advantage of events, take advantage of

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
big, you know, places where there are

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
thousands of people. Feel like we've

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
eliminated a lot of the risk associated

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,040
with a new consumer products company in

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
this space. We've got outsource

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
manufacturing. We've got the largest

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
distributor in the states and we need

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
someone to help us scale this business.

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
The good news for you guys is there

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,960
there's there's examples of beverages

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
that have gone viral and gone national.

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
You remember Skinny the Skinny Girl

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,639
story? Absolutely. Absolutely. That was

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,880
the same thing. Very viral for one

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,280
location then New York, Florida, Texas,

122
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,360
California, but she ran like hell for

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
everywhere else. The path of least

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
resistance is converting that person

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
that's buying that box of wine for a

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,919
party, but they don't know why they're

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
buying it. That's the easiest

128
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,320
conversion. And so Fronzia, an example,

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,639
is the number one box wine in the world.

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,960
Number one by volume, a billion dollars

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
in sales. Fronzia does a billion dollars

132
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,360
in sales. It is 3%. Do you know why?

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Because they've got 100% penetration in

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
distribution. And everybody's tried to

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,759
knock it off. I'm in the wine business.

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,400
I sell 15,000 cases a year, 2.6 million

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,000
this year. It took me three years to get

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
there. And the thing that's holding me

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,840
back for I'll tell you what's holding

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
you back. The name. It's called Oly.

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,360
That's why it sells. You got to call it

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,360
BB Boss. Yeah. I'll make you an offer.

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I'd like to offer you 400,000 for 20%.

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,720
Thank you so much. 400,000 for 20%.

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,960
Barbara. Yes. Guys, our biggest

146
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
challenge is breaking those states

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
through their distribution system. And

148
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
you could certainly help with that. No,

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
definitely. I'll put my offer on the

150
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
table with my own experience. I think

151
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm worth twice as much as Barbara. I'm

152
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,800
sorry. She doesn't know what she's doing

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,479
in this space. I'll give you 200,000 for

154
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
20%.

155
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,919
Cuz I think the business is worth a

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
million bucks right now. 200. So you're

157
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,080
cutting Barbara's offer in half. Yeah.

158
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,639
No, they can go because you make a

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,319
snoody wine that has nothing to do with

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
No. Unfortunately, I've lived through

161
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,720
distribution. We're going to do 22,000

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:16,000
cases, 9 liter cases this year. Mark,

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,240
what? What up? What up, homie?

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
I don't see this as a wine product. You

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
guys got that down, right? You guys

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
don't sell wine, right? Period.

167
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,840
Industry. You guys sell fun. You're

168
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
absolutely, right? And then the biggest

169
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,160
question is how do you connect with

170
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,919
enough people quickly enough to make it

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,080
grow fast enough that all of a sudden

172
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,680
you're going, what am I going to do now?

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Right? cuz you you're going as fast as

174
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,840
you can. You need a lot of help. You

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,759
want to create as big a splash as

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,720
possible. And I think I'm best suited up

177
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,400
here to do it. So, what I want to do is

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,400

400,000 for 20% from Barbara. 200,000

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,800
from

188
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,000
Mark, but Lori and Robert may also be

189
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,560
interested. I think you've got to blast

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,599
off. You've got to go fast. Last thing

191
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,199
you want is not being able to deliver

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,720
because, you know, viral is just that,

193
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,720
right? And either you're there to

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
fulfill Yeah. or you lose an

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
opportunity. I really appreciate you

196
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,720
saying that and that that offer you.

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,800
Thank you for making it. We we didn't

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
anticipate giving up. You know the

199
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
counter would just come back and tell

200
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,400
me. Yeah. So would you do a million for

201
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,400
a third?

202
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,310
Yeah. All right. Deal. Ready?

203
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
Wow.

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Congratulations. Let's party.

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Can we do work, guys? Let's do work,

207
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
baby. That's a 3 mil valuation. All

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
right, guys. I'll be in touch real soon

209
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
and we'll get it turned around. Wow.

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Thank you so much. You know what? He's

211
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,879
going to make money on it. Thank you so

212
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,599
much. Congrats, guys. Thank you so much.

213
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,680
And those are all mine. Don't take them.

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,080
We were going to make an offer, but I

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,599
wasn't going to come near that thing.

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,879
Did that really just happen? Oh my god.

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,520
Would I have ever imagined that we'd be

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,520
doing a million-dollar deal for with

219
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,840
Mark? No. Uh but here we are. We've done

220
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,639
it. And uh holy cow. Time to get to

221
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,240
work. I'm jealous of the deal. Let's

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
party.

223
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,360
[Applause]

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,320
save

[Music]

228
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,080
lives. Hello Sharks. My name is Charles

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,519
Michael Yim and I'm the founder and CEO

230
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,959
of Pthometer. I'm asking for $250,000

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,440
for 10% equity stake in my company. So,

232
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,160
just imagine you're at a dinner party or

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,240
maybe even a tailgate. Better yet, we're

234
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,399
at a local bar with some friends having

235
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,000
some champagne. Would anyone care for a

236
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,839
glass? Yes, please. Sure. Yeah. Well, I

237
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
thought I thought you were joking. Thank

238
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
you, Lori. Here you go.

239
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Damon doesn't like champagne, so I'll

240
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,800
take his. I was told he does. There you

241
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,959
go. That's Damon's favorite drink.

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Thank you, Senor. Charles, what should

243
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,720
we toast to? Uh, pitching to the sharks.

244
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,760
To you, Charles. Thank you. Sometimes it

245
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,839
ends badly, though. So, you know how it

246
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,160
goes. Eat some food. You have some

247
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,000
drinks. Before you know it, the night's

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,800
over and it's time to go home. And the

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,760
most important question is, are you safe

250
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,959
to drive?

251
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,040
And who would want to carry one of these

252
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,120
bulky old breathalyzers around? So

253
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,200
that's why I

254
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,519
created Brethrometer, the world's first

255
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
smartphone

256
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,440
breathalyzer. It's so small it can fit

257
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
in your

258
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,080
pocket. Let me show you how it works.

259
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Simply retract the audio jack, plug it

260
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,430
into the

261
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,360
smartphone, activate the

262
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,040
[Music]

263
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,399
app. Within a matter of seconds, you'll

264
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
be able to know what your breath alcohol

265
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,680
level is. And better yet, it can even

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
tell you how long it'll take to sober

267
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,000
up. And if need be, you can even hail a

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,480
cab with a push of a button. So please

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
join me on this mission to help people

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
make smarter and safer decisions one

271
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
breath at a time. Thank you. So is this

272
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
already on the market? Are you selling

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,880
it currently? So we basically launched

274
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,040
in March via an Indiegogo campaign. We

275
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
sold 4,000 units within 30 days. We

276
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,279
generated $140,000 in revenue. Indiegogo

277
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,720
is a crowdfunding. It's just like

278
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
Kickstarter, correct? What do you sell

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,279
them for, Charles? $49.99. Can we see

280
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,040
it? Can we see it? Yes. I've thought one

281
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,959
of the biggest issues around these

282
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
things when the first handheld units

283
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,200
came out was that you get arrested or

284
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,760
worse you harm somebody because you're

285
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,760
drunk and you relied on the device to

286
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,000
make your decision. Isn't that a huge

287
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,200
liability to you? First and foremost,

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
there's no replacement for good

289
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,760
judgment. And so the pathometer device

290
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,519
basically promotes making smarter and

291
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,440
safer decisions. We provide the

292
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
instruction manual. We clearly label

293
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
disclaimers throughout the app. And as

294
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
long as we do our part in the due

295
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,480
diligence and we uphold our side, we're

296
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
in the clear. Should I come up and try

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,079
this with you? Uh, sure. Feel free to

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,920
come up.

299
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,760
And if she doesn't pass, if I can't

300
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,600
walk, if she can walk on those heels,

301
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,720
you already have your answer. So,

302
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
basically, go ahead and plug it into the

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
audio jack of your smartphone. Um, all

304
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,200
you need to go do is hit the start

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:40,200
button. Okay. Go ahead and breathe into

306
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,200
this hole like there. A little closer.

307
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,600
You're at a 04 right now. That would be

308
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,839
legal. Yeah, you're legal. Does it tell

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
you if she has bad breath, too? Uh, it's

310
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,360
funny as you mentioned that uh there's

311
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,600
an also another sensor we're looking

312
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
into. It's for halattosis. And

313
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
seriously, I'm starting to think of this

314
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,480
as more of a multi-function

315
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
breathalyzer. So, the next one we're

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,560
actually trying to focus on is uh

317
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,720
diabetes. It's in clinical trials and

318
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
it's obviously less intrusive than blood

319
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,600
pricking. Right. Charles, how did you

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,120
develop it? Are you a software guy? Are

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
you a hardware design guy? So, I used to

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
code back in the day. I built and sold

323
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,760
my last company within 18 months. So

324
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
essentially I went straight into

325
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,519
developing Bometer as soon as I exited

326
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,360
my last company. If you sold your last

327
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
business and you did very well, why

328
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
don't you take some of that money and

329
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,240
invest it in this? I have. Uh so I

330
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
started off with the first initial

331
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
50,000. I've already raised half a

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
million dollars in total from angels.

333
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
What are you going to use the money for?

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,360
Uh strictly uh manufacturing of the

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,000
product. Well, the good news for you is

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,240
that both in Europe and Canada, Mexico,

337
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
US, we're going to almost a zero

338
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
tolerance on alcohol and driving.

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,639
Correct. That's the trend. I'm sure

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
you've heard about the Federal Safety

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,800
Board in the United States that's trying

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
to lower it from 08 to 0. I'm I'm a big

343
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
fan of the sensor business. I've got a

344
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,639
company, Motion Loft. We're all about

345
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,440
sensors and I think that's the future of

346
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,160
technology. Okay, I'm going to make I'm

347
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
going to make you an

348
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,440
offer, right? What I'd like to do is

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,399
offer you

350
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,399
$500,000 for 20% of the

351
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,519
company. That's my offer. Okay. I'll

352
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,360
give you a chance to talk to other

353
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,639
people because I know you

354
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,519
Mark, would you let me go in with you?

355
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,560
No. And handle the retail end. This is

356
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,639
not really I'm not worried about the

357
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,920
retail. That's just like a smidgen

358
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,920
versus the long-term benefit.

359
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,959
I'll give you 250,000 for 15%.

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,480
You wouldn't have to lose that much

361
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,600
equity then. That's not bad. Okay, it's

362
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,320
much less diluted than Mark's 20%. Okay,

363
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,560
and not nearly as much cash.

364
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,560
So, just to open up the the the funding

365
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
channel of communication. So, the whole

366
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,959
idea within the next 60 days is to close

367
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560
a full $1 million round from the Angels

368
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,320
back in Silicon Valley. So, what I'm

369
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,320
proposing is I'm more than willing to

370
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
open up the round, potentially involve

371
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
more than just one shark because I think

372
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,639
there's an incredible amount of value

373
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,440
here. Why don't you let the sharks do

374
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,320
the whole round? That's what I'm

375
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,360
proposing.

376
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,490
I don't I don't want to work with the

377
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,649
other sharks.

378
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,649
[Music]

379
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,120
You want to raise a million dollars,

380
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,199
don't you? I do want to raise a million.

381
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,920
So Mark's not giving you enough anyways.

382
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,519
Mark's not done talking yet.

383
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,760
All right, here's what I'll do, Charles.

384
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,240
I'll give you another $250,000 if Kevin

385
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,519
will have me on that. I'll do it. That

386
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,920
makes a lot of sense to me. And I'll

387
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,399
give you another 250,000

388
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,000
for 30%. Wow. Okay. Okay. And they have

389
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,399
no idea what they're investing in.

390
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,120
That's not true. It is absolutely true.

391
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,320
So, you've got 750, three times what you

392
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,760
asked for today, right, for 30%. Right.

393
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
You're very smart. I like to surround

394
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
myself with people much smarter than me.

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,160
That's why I have a challenge being up

396
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,720
here. Thank you very much. Um I want to

397
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,040
uh I think I want to match what you're

398
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,399
offering.

399
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,360
250,000 unlimited manufacturing. Okay.

400
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,880
10%.

401
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,480
and you wouldn't want to partake in the

402
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
groups. I've tried to get these three

403
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,240
bows together at breakfast one day and

404
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,279
and it's it's hard, you know? It's like

405
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,880
we don't we don't need all these people

406
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,880
right now. We can't agree. We've got

407
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,399
three maybe one. You could agree, Kevin.

408
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
What if we raise the dollar amount?

409
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,880
Wait, wait. I'm just saying for a

410
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,199
million bucks of straight equity and get

411
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,639
all the sharks in it. Now, I don't know

412
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,240
if Mark wants to play ball, but we need

413
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
a significant discount to do that. You

414
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,120
would be an unbelievable story if that

415
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
happened. That's true. Mark, because of

416
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,040
your previous investments in sensors,

417
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,120
you need the lion share. Tell us what

418
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,800
that is. Because competing with each

419
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,560
other is going to be very expensive

420
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,000
versus colluding with each other and

421
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,000
giving this guy every single

422
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,880
shark. Come on, Mr. Cuban.

423
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,720
Damn. You You're in on this, aren't you?

424
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,480
I'm willing to go in if Cuban's in and

425
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
you'll get all five sharks.

426
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
Charles has the potential of raising $1

427
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,920
million. All the funding he needs at

428
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,920
this point if Mark will join the rest of

429
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,519
the Sharks on a deal. Damian, you're in

430
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,600
on this, aren't you? I'm willing to go

431
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,839
in if Cuban's in, and you'll get all

432
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,839
five sharks.

433
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,519
Come on, Mr. Cuban.

434
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
You get the line share. What does the

435
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,360
lion share mean? What What equity do I

436
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
get? You get all five sharks. You need a

437
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,519
million bucks. Now it's your turn. Now

438
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,240
it's your turn to sell me.

439
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,759
Wow. Um, what can you give us on a

440
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,519
straight equity deal? This is your round

441
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,399
right here. Right now, the whole damn

442
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,519
thing. Wow, that's pretty serious. Uh,

443
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,040
oh, Charles, think.

444
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,040
You got to come up with a really good

445
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,040
offer.

446
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,880
[Music]

447
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,160
Okay. Would you be okay with taking say

448
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,120
300 doing 300,000 they split up the 700

449
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
amongst them?

450
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,079
I'll do I'll do 500k for 15%. For 15%.

451
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Yeah. Okay. All right. All five sharks

452
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:03,600
will give you a million dollars. 500,000

453
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:06,280
for Mark Cuban for 15% and 500,000 split

454
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,959
amongst the four of us for the other

455
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:16,400
15%. So $1 million for 30%. Um,

456
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
do it. Do it.

457
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,400
There's a reason the champagne's open,

458
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,640
my friend. Can I have a second to make a

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,360
phone call to my CFO? Yes, of course.

460
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,360
Okay. Thank you.

461
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,919
Hey, Matt. How's it going? Hey, Charles.

462
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,960
So, they have basically uh all have uh

463
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,679
provided an offer um all five of them.

464
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,400
And so basically a million dollars uh

465
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,080
for 30% uh of the company. So I just

466
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
want to kind of get your thoughts. You

467
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,160
know, a million for 30 um 30%, you know,

468
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,880
it's a $3.3 million valuation. Not a

469
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,559
huge valuation. Sure. I mean, I

470
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
fundamentally I'm a little bit worried

471
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,240
about too many cooks in the kitchen. I

472
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,919
mean, they all have big egos. Um and so,

473
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
you know, can they work together

474
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,880
effectively? Who wants to bet what he

475
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,200
comes back at? He'll come back at 25. I

476
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,640
say 25. Yeah, you're right. Well, let's

477
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,799
see what happens. He's been out there a

478
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,799
long time.

479
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,360
Charles, welcome back. Thank you. You

480
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,600
have an opportunity to get all five

481
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,480
sharks and the power of all sharks

482
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:35,960
behind you. Right. Here's the deal. $1

483
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,280
million, 500,000 from Mark Cuban for

484
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,360
15% and 500,000 from the rest of the

485
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,200
Sharks. We're going to split it right

486
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,799
for a total of 30% for $1 million. And

487
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,039
the power of Shark Tank, what are you

488
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,039
going to do?

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,360
I accept. All right.

490
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
Wow. That's great. I got to tell you, I

491
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,840
didn't see that coming, but that's Thank

492
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,320
you. That's great. Thank you very much.

493
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,320
Thank you very much.

494
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,679
Change our mind. We all have a toast

495
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,760
with us. All right. Cheers, guys.

496
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,840
Cheers. Cheers.

497
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
I've never thought about raising all the

498
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,320
cash that we needed from the entire team

499
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,440
of the Sharks. I'm ecstatic right now. I

500
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,440
have no words. I'm shocked.

501
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,960
[Music]

502
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,200
Hi Sharks. My name is Ari Tolwin and I'm

503
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
Joe Ceino. We're from New York and we're

504
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,080
seeking $1 million in exchange for 5% of

505
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,880
our business. Wow, you got our

506
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,640
attention. Sharks, milk today means

507
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
something totally different from what

508
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
the milkman used to deliver to our

509
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,320
homes. Sure, some of us still drink

510
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,480
cow's milk, but most of us have switched

511
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,120
to almond milk, oat milk, or even hemp

512
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,520
milk. But sharks, that comes at a price.

513
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,440
Most of those milks are hyper processed,

514
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,440
filled with gums, preservatives, and

515
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
fillers galore. Well, sharks, that's

516
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,480
where we come in. Move on over cow's

517
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,880
milk because making fresh, dairyfree

518
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,720
milk just became utterly easy.

519
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,320
Introducing new milk. We built a custom

520
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,799
machine for grocery stores where

521
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,960
shoppers can make delicious, nutritious,

522
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,440
pure, dairyfree milk at the push of a

523
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
button. We use the best ingredients.

524
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,840
Organic almonds from Spain for our

525
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,679
almond milks. A blend of organic cacao,

526
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,400
vanilla bean, and maple for our

527
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,400
chocolate milks. And a whole lot more.

528
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,799
Our new milks are homemade without the

529
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,120
mess or the fuss. We're on a mission to

530
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,679
bring plant-based diets and zerowaste

531
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,600
lifestyles to the world. So, Sharks, I

532
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,720
just have one question. Who wants to

533
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,799
milk this deal for all it's worth?

534
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,640
Sharks, in front of you are a flight of

535
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
delicious dairyfree milks for each of

536
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,960
you to try. But before you do so, Mark,

537
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,640
you've mentioned you're dairyfree. Come

538
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,360
on up and make some fresh milk for

539
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,280
yourself.

540
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,200
Sure. So, you can select almond milk or

541
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,480
oat milk. I'm going to go with almond

542
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,960
milk cuz I've had it, so I'll know what

543
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,640
it tastes like in comparison. Great. So,

544
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,200
just press that almond milk button and

545
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
then start on the bottom. So, the

546
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,000
machine is actually making it fresh.

547
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,919
It's not a concentrate or anything else

548
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
in there. It's taking pure organic

549
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,000
almonds from Valencia and making the

550
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
milk right now. That's fast. That's

551
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
cool.

552
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,240
The almond milk's very good. It tastes

553
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,919
nothing like the store brand. The milk I

554
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,799
just made incredible. You can tell it's

555
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,559
fresh almonds. It's incredible. Just to

556
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,240
understand what's in the machine. Give

557
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,480
us the choices. So, the first thing

558
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,760
about New Milk is that we're uh really a

559
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
food tech company and we built a

560
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
platform. Right now we have almond milk

561
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,080
and oat milk in there, but we could do

562
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,919
cashew. We could do hemp if that becomes

563
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,480
popular. We could do sesame. It's really

564
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,240
limitless. So, how long does it last and

565
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
what would be the expiration date on one

566
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,000
of these? Great question. It'll have a 7

567
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,520
to 10 day shelf life and it has to stay

568
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,600
in the fridge. I mean, I think that's

569
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
the,000lb gorilla in the room. You

570
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
coming to the Shark Tank, you want to

571
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
think big, right? You're asking for a

572
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,559
million bucks. Obviously, you need

573
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
capital to build out and lease these

574
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,480
machines to all the locations. That's a

575
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,559
different kind of business model because

576
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,000
they require maintenance. They require,

577
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,159
you know, the capital to build them.

578
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,720
Yeah. And then you also have to get the

579
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,799
space inside the grocery store to give

580
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,880
you what looks to me like about 10

581
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,320
square ft. Barbara, you're a real estate

582
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
mogul. You understand the value of

583
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,840
square footage. I'll tell you exactly

584
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,640
what it is in Midtown Manhattan for a

585
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,520
street location. It's 3,000 a foot in a

586
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,960
primary location. Yep. How big is that?

587
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,760
So, it's it's eight square feet. The

588
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,760
machines average $50,000 per year per

589
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,799
machine. And so when you think about it,

590
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,559
revenue in in revenue. Yep. And it's

591
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,480
unmanned and we pay no rent at all. What

592
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,960
does a machine cost? Uh the machines are

593
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,080
$30,000 each. They'll come down to 15.

594
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
You know, guys, I think it's a genius

595
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,919
idea. Number one, you're reducing

596
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
grocery stores perishable loss, right?

597
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,200
Number two is you're attracting new

598
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,880
customers. I like that uh that whole

599
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
concept. But were you in this area

600
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
before in traditional business? Like

601
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,240
tell us a little bit about yourselves.

602
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,320
Yeah. So, uh I come from the food and

603
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,559
beverage world. Before this, I did

604
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,720
aviation catering uh for commercial

605
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,799
jets, private jets. So, if you guys flew

606
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,520
to New York, you've eaten our food. Then

607
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,240
I started my own co-acking uh company

608
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,799
doing food and beverages. Uh after that,

609
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
I left and I started this with Ari. I'm

610
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
also a second time entrepreneur in the

611
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,360
space. I had a brand called Happy Tree

612
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,200
Maple Water. I had national

613
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,960
distribution. We were about 8,000

614
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,400
stores. Did you have an exit on that

615
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,240
water company? Uh, no. I shut it down

616
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,080
actually after we started this. I have a

617
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
question. What would Mark pay for that

618
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,440
bottle of almond milk that he took away?

619
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah, you'd pay $2 for the for the

620
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,280
bottle. That's a onetime uh charge. And

621
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,200
if you brought it back, you'd pay $3.99

622
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,200
to refill it. Okay. It's $3.99 for the

623
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,600
almond milk, $2 for the bottle. How much

624
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,360
goes to the grocery store? Yep. So, the

625
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,120
grocery store takes about a third. All

626
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,600
right. So, how much have you raised? Uh,

627
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,840
we've raised $12 million.

628
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,440
Wow. What was the last valuation? Our

629
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
last valuation was 40 million pre-

630
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,080
money. So, we've actually negotiated

631
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,559
with our investors in advance to give

632
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,960
you uh a Shark appropriate deal. Guys,

633
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,720
is there a bigger picture here? This is

634
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,000
obviously a big picture. Yes. Hit him,

635
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,840
Joe. So, this is our countertop device.

636
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,919
This is the bottle that goes with it.

637
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,360
Wow. We took a grocery machine. We

638
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,880
shrunk it down so it works on your

639
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
countertop so you can have the best.

640
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
That right there is a necessity for the

641
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,400
family, I think. What is that going to

642
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,960
cost the consumer? It's going to be

643
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,799
about $85 landed. That's your cost. What

644
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
was your plan to sell it to them for

645
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,640
then? Uh $1.99. Can you show us how the

646
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,279
small machine works? This is actually

647
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,520
just a 3D rendering prototype. Okay

648
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,679
guys, let's get into the numbers. Just

649
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,200
the basics, please. Top line, bottom

650
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,919
line. Topline, bottom line. Last three

651
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,320
years. Yeah. So 2018, $40,000 of

652
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,559
revenue, one machine, partial year.

653
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,400
What'd you lose? Spent a lot on R&D. So

654
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,320
we spent about $2 million on R&D in

655
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,840
2018. Losses were 2 mill. Correct.

656
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,679
Approximately 2019 320 topline. We ended

657
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,600
the year with 10 machines. How much you

658
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,159
lose? And then we spent $3 million on

659
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,159
R&D. So 5 million total losses so far.

660
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,919
Now we're getting to some critical mass

661
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,320
here. Yeah. What happens in the third

662
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,919
year? So third year is this year. Uh we

663
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,159
would have ended the year in about a $6

664
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,000
million year, but because of Corona

665
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,520
virus, our launch with Kroger, some

666
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,960
growth with Whole Foods, a launch with

667
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,559
Gellson's and some other regional

668
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
retailers were delayed. So what do you

669
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,600
think losses will be this year? This

670
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,600
year it's going to be about $2 million

671
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,799
as well, mostly R&D. 7 mil in the

672
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,799
ground. How much cash do you have in the

673
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,000
bank? 3 and a2 million. You projected

674
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
six, but where do you think you'll land

675
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
now? Uh, this year we're going to be

676
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,799
like 400k by the end of the year in

677
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,720
sales. Yeah. Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

678
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,200
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. You said you

679
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,440
projected 6 million for this year, but

680
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,480
you feel you're going to end at 400?

681
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
Yeah. So, we would have we would have

682
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,840
ended up with 100 machines at the end of

683
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
the year. Can I get your attention just

684
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,760
for a moment, please? I've been sitting

685
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,679
here listening to every word. I still

686
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,240
don't get it. And I'm paying attention

687
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,400
like crazy. Ash, I'm sitting here

688
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,640
feeling like I'm back in second grade

689
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,960
failing again because I don't know what

690
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,960
the hell the teacher is talking about

691
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,520
yet again. You talk so much that I can't

692
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,799
grab a single word. I'm sure you've got

693
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,840
something good there. I don't know what

694
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:15,020
the heck it is, but I'm out.

695
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,480
I'm confused, too. I'm out.

696
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,480
[Music]

697
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Lori, you can help us bring this to

698
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,679
millions of people around the world. And

699
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
I see you maybe struggling a little bit,

700
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
but I think you want to do it. Problem

701
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,640
for me is, you know, you only have so

702
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,200
much time in here. There's a lot to

703
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,039
explain about your business model,

704
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,559
right? And I don't think we've gotten a

705
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,360
lot of those answers out. If you're

706
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,279
asking for a million dollars for 5%,

707
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,120
you're losing money. This is a

708
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
prototype, so you don't even know yet.

709
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,440
We don't know. We actually have five of

710
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,120
these uh countertops in the field, but

711
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,039
they're stainless steel models for

712
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,600
coffee shops.

713
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,919
You came in asking for a pretty hefty

714
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,360
sum. It's just not investable for me

715
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,039
right now. I'm sorry. I'm out.

716
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
Joe, what do you sell the stainless

717
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,720
steel commercial unit? Uh $6.99. And

718
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,440
what do they cost you to make? 300

719
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
bucks. 300 bucks. All right, guys. Look,

720
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,000
I thought you were nuts when you first

721
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,760
walked out here, but now I have a

722
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
different opinion.

723
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,080
You did a very good job in presenting

724
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,919
the opportunity. I don't agree with my

725
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,799
fellow sharks. I get what you're doing.

726
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,760
It's extremely interesting.

727
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,760
I'm going to make you an offer.

728
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,000
Three sharks are out, but Kevin is

729
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,039
interested in Joe and Ari's plant-based

730
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,159
milk machine, New

731
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,679
Milk. I thought you were nuts when you

732
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,520
first walked out here, but now I have a

733
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,000
different opinion. I'm going to make you

734
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,360
an offer. I actually think there's a

735
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,279
huge fundamental demand for your

736
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,320
product, and I love watching Mark go

737
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,080
nuts over uh plant-based stuff. You

738
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,159
know, I'm a modified vegan. I only eat

739
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,000
vegan on Tuesdays. So, serious. The uh

740
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,000
the structure is difficult here because

741
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,840
you've already raised so much capital. I

742
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,919
would stick this in my venture debt fund

743
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,399
and I'd do an offer like this. I will

744
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,399
loan you a million dollars at 9.5%

745
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,960
interest for 3 years. That will cost you

746
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,120
8,000 a month and I will take 5% equity

747
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,799
that you offer. You know, I don't know

748
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
what Mark's going to do, but it gets you

749
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,760
into my sphere of the shark world and

750
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,200
you can talk to any of my entrepreneurs.

751
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,840
I do a hell of a job on digital for

752
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,760
them. So, if you're going after

753
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,880
consumers, I can help you. Yes. So,

754
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
first of all, really appreciate the

755
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
offer. Um, we do believe you could bring

756
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,039
a lot of value to the business. It's not

757
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,799
what we had in mind uh when we walked in

758
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,360
here. So, we want to at least get It's

759
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,720
an offer. Absolutely. Believe me, I was

760
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,559
not planning on giving you a million

761
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,000
bucks when I first saw this thing.

762
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,320
Okay, so here's the thing. So, you've

763
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,640
got $3 million left in the bank for two

764
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,559
products. I obviously love the stainless

765
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,559
steel version that you're putting in

766
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,480
coffee shops right now. I think that'll

767
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,679
sell like hot cakes at home. I think

768
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,679
you'll sell a million units easily. You

769
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,000
have it priced at $6.99. I think it'll

770
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,159
be priced at $8.99. And given your

771
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,120
margin at that price, you make $500 a

772
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,360
unit. That's a lot of money. But with

773
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,480
just $3 million in the bank between

774
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,559
marketing, right, and inventory and

775
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
receivables and everything else, you're

776
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,760
not going to have enough cash. So, you

777
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,440
guys know coming in you're going to have

778
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,480
to negotiate. So, let's just cut to the

779
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,480
chase. 5% is not enough. Can you do 6%.

780
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,720
No. What do you want?

781
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,279
Okay, guys. Here's my offer. I'm going

782
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,360
to give you $2 million. You only ask for

783
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,840
one. I'm going to give you $2 million. 1

784
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,720
million of that is going to be for 7%

785
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,640
equity. The other million is going to be

786
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,600
a loan at 3% interest. But I get an

787
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,080
additional 3% of stock as advisory

788
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,520
shares of straight up equity. But if you

789
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,320
don't use the loan, you don't have to

790
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,559
give me the 3% equity for that loan. So

791
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,240
in total, if you use all the capital,

792
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,200
it's $2 million for 10%.

793
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,799
Um, do you have a little bit of

794
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,720
flexibility? We we really want to work

795
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,679
with you. You can help us grow this. It

796
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,159
can be awesome, a major global success.

797
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,399
Do you have a little bit of flexibility?

798
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,600
That was my

799
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,840
flexibility. It's a It's a great offer,

800
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,039
Mark. We love it.

801
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
Depends how much you want to change the

802
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,799
world. Is 1% going to change?

803
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,799
Flexibility. We're at five, seven, can't

804
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,320
do six. You came in asking for a

805
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,250
million, and now you have access to 2

806
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,960
million.

[Music]

808
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,679
You got a deal. Deal. Yes, sir.

809
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,679
Appreciate it, guys.

810
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,279
Joe, you spoke up at the right moment.

811
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,399
Congratulations, guys. Good luck with

812
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,679
everything. We accept the

813
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,799
congratulations, but the work starts

814
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,000
now. Exactly. Right.

815
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,440
We just did a $2 million deal with Mark

816
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,279
Cuban. He beat us up a little bit at the

817
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,039
end, but we couldn't be more excited to

818
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,919
work with him and continue to grow new

819
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,919
milk to be a great

820
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,720
success. Next into the tank are

821
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,070
entrepreneurs with a business profiting

822
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,750
from competitive thrill

[Music]

824
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,880
seekers. Greetings sharks. My name is

825
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,640
Brad Scutter and I'm Rob Dickens. We're

826
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,480
from Boston, Massachusetts. Our company

827
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,000
is Rugged Races and we're seeking $1

828
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,000
million for 10% of our

829
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,440
company. So, what is Rugged Races? We

830
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,440
operate a popular 5K obstacle course

831
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,600
race series in 20 cities across the

832
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,520
country called Rugged Maniac. At our

833
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,520
events, participants of all ages, all

834
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,039
genders, all shapes and sizes will

835
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,000
complete a challenging running course

836
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,760
featuring 25 epic obstacles. But these

837
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
aren't the pop-up kitty obstacles you'll

838
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,600
see at our competitors events. At Rugged

839
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,519
Maniac, participants will climb over

840
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,679
towers and shipping containers, rocket

841
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,279
down in 100 foot water slides, crawl

842
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,279
through tunnels of mud, and even jump

843
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,440
over fire. All while running through a

844
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,519
combination of forest, fields, ski

845
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,519
slopes, and even motocross tracks. In

846
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,760
short, Rugged Maniac strikes the perfect

847
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,600
balance between fun and physicality with

848
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
our award-winning courses and our dayong

849
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,519
festival. So, which one of you sharks is

850
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,360
ready to get rugged with us? And just to

851
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,640
show you what we're all about, we've got

852
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
this video clip right

853
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,600
here. Wow.

854
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
I didn't even know you existed, but I

855
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
know about your competitor. me like

856
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,679
tough mutter. How are you different than

857
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,760
that? We're we're different in this

858
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,080
sense. Basically, tough mutter is a 12

859
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,559
mile course, right? With about 20

860
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,240
obstacles. We have 25 obstacles over 3

861
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,480
miles. So, it's more about the obstacles

862
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,679
and less about the running. And being a

863
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,360
three-mile course, it's much more

864
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,799
accessible to the general public than

865
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,480
something like a 12mi course. Are you

866
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,559
saying this is a tamer version of that?

867
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,320
Something that Barbara would do? Oh, I

868
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,760
could handle the 12 miles. It's this

869
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,440
little short guy over here that wouldn't

870
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,200
have a shot at it. Well, we get people

871
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,399
of all shapes and sizes at our events.

872
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,720
truly from 77y old guys to uh you know

873
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,720
mother daughter teens 14y old and up. Is

874
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,399
it more workout or more party? We think

875
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,159
we strike an excellent balance between

876
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,440
the workout and the party because it's a

877
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,120
shorter race. It takes you know on

878
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,200
average an hour a little bit more to

879
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,559
finish. People are are exhausted but

880
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
they're still exhilarated. Do people

881
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,519
bring alcohol? No. Would you sell? No.

882
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,360
Yes, we sell alcohol.

883
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:22,000
Alcohol outdoor festival. Pump piled

884
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,720
puke. Right. Exactly. It's a It's fun.

885
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,200
It's a fun event. So, what are sales

886
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,480
going to be this year? This year, 4.2

887
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,880
million. How many? 20 cities nationwide.

888
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,200
How much out of the 4.2 did you profit?

889
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,960
Million dollars. But next year, without

890
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,039
investment, we're projecting 6.5 million

891
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,480
in revenue, 2.2 million profits. Talk

892
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,320
about the industry. There's some

893
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
monsters out there. You know, what's the

894
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,880
difference? So, basically, you've got

895
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,200
you got two kind of at the top. The

896
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,320
Warrior Dash 5K, Tough Motor 12. And why

897
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,399
have they gotten so much bigger than you

898
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,320
guys? First movers in the market. And

899
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,440
how big are they, Rob? How big are they?

900
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,880
They have like 40 or five events. In

901
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,159
terms of revenue, take a guess. How big

902
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,760
would they be? I think they're about 30

903
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,840
million. So, would you guys say this

904
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,840
industry is about 100 million a year?

905
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,799
Much larger. More than that, Rob, what

906
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,200
what are you going to do with the 1

907
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,720
million? We've uh we've taken that money

908
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,960
and invested it in other brands that we

909
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,000
own. Um what? So, wait a wait. No, no.

910
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,679
What are we going to do with the $1

911
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,879
million that we would get from you?

912
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
Sorry. What million were you talking

913
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,520
about, Brian? I thought you wanted to

914
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,520
know what we did with our profits. Well,

915
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,119
we want to know that, too. Great. What

916
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,639
did you do with the 1 million in profit?

917
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,159
Let me show you exactly what we've done

918
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,130
with that other money. Okay, let's see.

919
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,249
Let's see. Here it is.

920
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,249
[Music]

921
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,760
Oh, you guys are doing these things?

922
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,760
It's so

923
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,359
stupid. That's a great idea. Rob,

924
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,800
explain to me what I saw. You saw

925
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,200
Running with the Bulls. Okay. Here in

926
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,200
the US. Anybody get hurt? We had some

927
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,159
minor injuries, couple concussions, a

928
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,919
broken arm. the injury rate.

929
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,359
People paid for this. Oh, yeah. About

930
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,440
the same price as his rugged maniac.

931
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:01,280
About $50. But is that part of this

932
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,079
deal? Separate company that separate

933
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,079
lawyers. Have you never seen the show?

934
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
Greedy pig. I give you a million

935
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,160
dollars. I don't I don't get to wet my

936
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,640
beak on the bull deal. No. Of course we

937
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,760
get. Are you guys kidding? Of course

938
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,520
that's not going to work. Can't be

939
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,359
serious. They're full of I give you a

940
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
chance to change your mind. Okay. We

941
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,680
would want more money if you get

942
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
involved in the bull. So the bull run is

943
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,359
is a separate entity. All right. Why

944
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
don't we entertain it? How much more

945
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,839
would it be to $2 million for 10% of the

946
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,240
bull run? 2 million for the bull and 1

947
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,720
million for the rugged. Yeah. So 3

948
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,920
million bucks gets 10% of both. Brad,

949
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,240
what are the sales in the second

950
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,960
company? 280,000 at the first event. But

951
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,200
do do you realize that your expertise is

952
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,760
not rugged maniac? Your expertise is in

953
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,440
putting on adventure events. The bull

954
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,599
run is just another variant of this same

955
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,280
thing. That's exactly right. And so the

956
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,280
growth potential with this company is

957
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
not just within rugged maniac. Guys,

958
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,480
what's the cash flow going to be next

959
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,480
year under your optimistic scenario for

960
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,079
both companies?

961
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,000
We think it could be a $20 million event

962
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,160
this year. Guys, I like the business,

963
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,240
but if I come in and give you money and

964
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,720
all of a sudden it's like, where's Brian

965
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,640
and Rob? Oh, they're chasing the bulls,

966
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,320
right? What am I going to say to you as

967
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
an investor when I'm not getting your

968
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,160
full attention? I want a piece of the

969
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,680
bulls. No kidding. No, that's not what

970
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,760
I'm gonna say. I'm gonna say they can

971
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,119
die, right? I want a return on my

972
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,160
investments or I'm suing your ass

973
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,839
because you have a conflict of

974
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,440
interest. No investor says, "Oh, the

975
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,440
existing business is dying. Sell me a

976
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,200
piece of the new one." Well, you don't

977
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,760
do that to investors. You align your

978
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,040
interest with them 100%. When you start

979
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
talking about a million dollars, you

980
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,119
don't screw around, right? That's a real

981
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,920
investment. The other the element for

982
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,520
me, I love the idea. I also really love

983
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,119
the fact that you're building a customer

984
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,560
base for the other events that you can

985
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,440
hold later on. For me, they're together.

986
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,880
Here's an offer for you.

987
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,280
Sure. Both businesses

988
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:02,280
combined. I'll give you 1.5 million for

989
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
25%.

990
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,640
Okay. Is that the only offer that we

991
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,640
have?

992
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,200
Mark, you said you were interested. No,

993
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,640
I'm very I I love the one business. If

994
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,640
if I didn't know about this other

995
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,480
business, I'd probably make an offer

996
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,839
right now. Sure. Right. But I want to

997
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,359
hear what you say to Rob. I think I'm

998
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,680
giving you a fair offer. I think the

999
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,240
business is worth what? Six times Ebida,

1000
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,920
1.5 times revenue roughly. And I'm

1001
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,079
pricing in. I think that's generous. I'm

1002
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,880
pricing it in because I see the upside

1003
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,440
in the other business. Okay. Asking for

1004
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,920
$1 million for this business was already

1005
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,240
challenging. having another agenda and

1006
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,160
another business on the other side. My

1007
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,599
gut feeling is my instinct is that no

1008
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,880
matter what, I would be screwed working

1009
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,400
with you. I wouldn't trust you. I'm out.

1010
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,599
Okay. Thank you for your consideration.

1011
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,839
You know, a funny thing happened to me

1012
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,119
watching you here today. Uh you came out

1013
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,280
here, I thought, "What good-looking

1014
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,440
guys, man. They look the part. What a

1015
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,599
great video." But then somewhere along

1016
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,520
the way, the surprise of the bulls and

1017
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,440
oh yeah, we'll wrap that into the deal.

1018
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,359
And I don't think maybe you intended it

1019
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,680
that way, but for some reason, you lost

1020
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,000
my trust.

1021
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,400
[Music]

1022
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,680
But either way, I'm not sorry to hear

1023
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,680
that, but we thank you for your

1024
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,240
consideration. Well, guys, you have you

1025
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,760
have a you have an offer on the table.

1026
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,160
Yes, we do. Uh, what are you going to

1027
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,960
do? An offer that's

1028
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,400
lower than what we had wanted, but No,

1029
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,720
let me make you an offer higher than

1030
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,480
what you want. Well, yeah, of course. I

1031
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Anyone else want to throw an offer in

1032
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,200
the ring? I'm still listening. Well,

1033
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,960
Mark, your concern is that you you want

1034
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,200
us to focus all our energies on one. No,

1035
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
no, it's not that. You came in and you

1036
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,440
tried to sell us one business and you

1037
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,560
separated the two. You're overvaluing

1038
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,200
the other business in my opinion. And if

1039
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,119
you have such an a high opinion of that

1040
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,960
business, that's probably where a lot of

1041
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,119
your attention is going to be. And as an

1042
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,880
investor, I don't think it's worth the

1043
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,640
the value that you're assigned into it

1044
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,960
because you've had one event for

1045
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,110
$200,000. Mark, are you saying my value

1046
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,880
is too high? Yes.

1047
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,800
[Music]

1048
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,119
Wow. Now Mark's making me nervous about

1049
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,119
am I overpaying?

1050
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
Two sharks are out. Robert has made an

1051
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,280
offer, but Mark's concerns may have

1052
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,119
caused a change of heart. Mark, are you

1053
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,040
saying my value is too high? Yes.

1054
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,760
Wow. Now Mark's making me nervous about

1055
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,000
am I

1056
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,320
overpaying? 1.5 million 25%. That gives

1057
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you about a $6 million value for the

1058
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,040
combined businesses. The longer we wait,

1059
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,480
the the less comfortable I'm starting to

1060
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,400
feel. Let me uh cloudy the waters a

1061
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,760
little bit here and maybe give you a

1062
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
Hang on, Robert. You may want to hear

1063
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,160
this.

1064
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,680
I think your offer should be for 33 a

1065
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,800
third. You become a third partner with

1066
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,800
these guys and then I go in 50/50 with

1067
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
you.

1068
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,119
Hm. I'm good with that. I like going up

1069
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,000
to

1070
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:08,560
1/3. 1.5 million for one/3 of the

1071
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,320
combined businesses. I'm with you, Uncle

1072
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,160
Kevin. Yeah, I thought you might be

1073
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,240
because I think you did overpay. Rob,

1074
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,680
isn't it interesting what's happened?

1075
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:23,240
You had an offer at here. Now we're

1076
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,240
here. Sure. The longer we stay here,

1077
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:33,040
So, what I would be willing to

1078
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:36,000
do is 1.5 million, but it's for 25% of

1079
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,000
the two companies

1080
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
combined.

1081
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:47,720
Okay, we're going to go discuss this,

1082
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,720
consider both offers, and come back.

1083
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,680
I think there's a lot of benefit here to

1084
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,760
partner with these guys. I'm not sure

1085
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,599
what there is to discuss. Mark, you made

1086
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,119
a better offer than we did. Yeah, Mark

1087
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,560
made the same as your initial. The

1088
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,480
challenge is when they come back, do you

1089
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,160
drop this dead weight right here and go

1090
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,760
back to your initial offer? Then you're

1091
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,760
overpaying. I don't think they're going

1092
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,760
to take either offer. Oh, I think they

1093
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,760
will.

1094
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,160
Okay, gentlemen. Let's summarize what's

1095
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,560
happened here. You have two distinct

1096
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,040
offers. The first to Mr. Cuban is for

1097
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,319
1.5 million for 25% of your company,

1098
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,319
which by the way was the exact same

1099
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,680
offer I made and then he spent half an

1100
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,800
hour telling you how bad your business

1101
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,040
is. I know. I know. The other offer is

1102
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,280
for the same amount of money for 33 and

1103
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,480
a third of your business. What are you

1104
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,760
going to do?

1105
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,520
We went out there and discussed it. We

1106
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,520
we'd like to eventually strike a deal

1107
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,359
with you.

1108
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,079
We wanted to come back in and say,

1109
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,040
"Listen, we do 2 million for for the

1110
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,780
25%." Instead of doing that, we'd like

1111
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,859
to split it in the middle and go 1.75.

1112
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,859
[Music]

1113
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,520
Deal.

1114
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,200
Deal. Going to work, baby. Looking

1115
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,400
forward to it, right? Looking forward to

1116
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,920
looking forward to it. Absolutely. We'll

1117
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,440
make some money. You lose out. But

1118
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,119
Robert, why do you do that? Thank you

1119
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,960
for your consideration. Thanks, guys.

1120
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,040
Thank you. Fired up.

1121
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,040
We are very excited. We took that offer

1122
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,599
from Mark because we realized that Mark

1123
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,280
offers more than just money. Mark offers

1124
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,800
his experience. He offers his

1125
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,720
connections. You know, only great things

1126
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,319
can come from. Well done. 1.75 for 25%.

1127
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,960
I'm actually surprised that they came

1128
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,960
down from that.

1129
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,079
Next into the tank is a business that

1130
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,160
aspires to make unmanned flight

1131
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:45,460
accessible for everyone.

1132
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,460
[Music]

1133
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,200
Hi, I'm JD Clarage. And I'm Charles

1134
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,640
Manning. Our company is XCraft. We're

1135
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,599
looking to seek $500,000 in exchange for

1136
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,480
20% of the company. Much like when the

1137
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,200
Wright brothers first took flight in

1138
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,440
1903, we are witnessing a new dawn of

1139
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:12,640
aviation, the age of unmanned flight.

1140
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,880
The X+1 is a drone redefined. We've

1141
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,520
combined both the hovering precision of

1142
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,680
a helicopter and the fast flight of an

1143
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,040
aircraft. You can soar at speeds of up

1144
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,079
to 60 mph and climb as high as 10,000

1145
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,440
ft. And you can seamlessly transition

1146
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,599
from high speed back to hover. How cool.

1147
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,920
Xcraft is breaking boundaries and with

1148
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,839
your help, the sky will no longer be the

1149
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,440
limit.

1150
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,760
JD, how is it different from all the

1151
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,119
traditional drones I can buy today? So,

1152
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,440
the fundamental difference is the

1153
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,319
ability to transition to forward flight

1154
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,599
and it does that with a

1155
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,960
wing. This is the wing right here. This

1156
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,880
this main area is the wing. Okay. So, so

1157
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,880
uh it's hovering and then when you want

1158
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,079
to go into forward flight, it rotates

1159
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,240
like that. Now, it's an airplane. Why do

1160
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,560
I care the fact that I can go so much

1161
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,640
faster? You can capture a fastoving

1162
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
subject like a car or, you know, a

1163
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,760
motorcycle or something like that. And

1164
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,160
what's the range on this? Because if

1165
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,520
it's going 60 m an hour, uh, you would

1166
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,440
have to probably be in a helicopter to

1167
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,280
accompany it, right? Or or you can be

1168
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,880
stationary. You can be stationary. Yeah.

1169
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,440
I mean, it definitely it's maneuverable,

1170
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,280
so you can stay within visual range. But

1171
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,119
one key part is that this system

1172
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,800
actually can run entirely autonomously.

1173
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,280
You can build a flight plan on a C on a

1174
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,359
on a software system on a PC and have it

1175
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,920
go do those things and come back.

1176
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,000
Charles, am I allowed to create a flight

1177
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,359
plan for an unmanned drone and just lay

1178
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
it out there? Yes, that's a good

1179
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,640
question, Robert. There there are

1180
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,040
regulations and and rules right now and

1181
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,119
and primarily uh if you're flying for

1182
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,280
recreational purposes, uh you need to

1183
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,240
keep it within line of sight, stay away

1184
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,920
from other aircraft and airports, uh as

1185
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,240
well as personal property, and then you

1186
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,240
can't fly any higher than 400 ft. How

1187
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,880
much does it cost you to make? Uh, it

1188
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,880
cost us $400 to make it. And what do you

1189
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,839
sell it for? It retails right now for

1190
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,200
$1,800. Have you sold any? Yeah, we've

1191
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,119
got uh 173,000 uh right now in

1192
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,079
pre-sales. And that's Kickstarter then?

1193
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,000
Uh yes, Kickstarter was 143,000 and then

1194
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,599
we've done about 30,000 cents on our

1195
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
website.

1196
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,359
Guys, what's your what's your

1197
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,680
background? Are you uh engineers or?

1198
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,760
Yeah. So, uh, I have worked, I'm an

1199
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,760
aerospace engineer by trade. I started

1200
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,760
at a school and worked at Oracle and

1201
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,200
I've been in software my whole history.

1202
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,640
Um, I was looking at some drones

1203
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,800
yesterday actually because I have a

1204
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,720
property with 36 acres and I want to buy

1205
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,520
something cuz I'm getting a designation

1206
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,480
of managed forest and one of my

1207
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,319
responsibilities is to scan it every

1208
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,480
year to look for diseased trees. So, I'm

1209
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,119
going to buy a drone. Can I configure

1210
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,200
the camera on a gyroscope below it so

1211
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,560
that I can film from below? cuz I have

1212
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,680
to turn it into airplane mode to use

1213
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,200
that camera the way you've got it

1214
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,240
configured. We're working on it right

1215
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,160
now so that we can actually hover it

1216
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:58,960
inverted and Oh, there's more. Yeah. So,

1217
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,240
uh this is called phone drone. A what?

1218
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,079
Phone drone. Phone drone. Bingo. So, uh

1219
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,000
we can use our smartphones for all

1220
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,200
different sorts of things today. That's

1221
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,319
great. But never have we been able to uh

1222
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,079
allow our smartphones to fly

1223
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,240
until now.

1224
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,520
I love this stuff. And uh we have a

1225
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,079
little video that uh we can show you.

1226
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,680
Sure. Would love to see that. Oh my god.

1227
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,680
Oh, that is so cool. And do you use the

1228
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
sensors in the phone to do the balance

1229
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,280
and everything? Exactly. We do. So yeah,

1230
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,760
uh smartphones today have, you know,

1231
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,079
gyros and accelerometers. Uh they've got

1232
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,920
GPS. They've got a lot of them have very

1233
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,240
decent cameras. So really that's all the

1234
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,839
expensive components in a drone. So So

1235
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,680
we've leveraged that and basically

1236
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,079
turned a smartphone into a drone. How

1237
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,760
much does this one cost to make and how

1238
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,880
much do you sell it for? This is not

1239
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,240
currently for sale. This is in

1240
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,920
development. What do you think it will

1241
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,319
cost? Uh, we're looking at around a

1242
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,000
price point retail of $300. Probably

1243
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,760
less than $100 to make. Jade, answer

1244
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,680
this for me. Where's the secret sauce in

1245
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,680
your company? Like, tell me what

1246
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,200
somebody can't knock off. You you know

1247
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,280
what it is? It's really about the IP

1248
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,960
behind the designs. The IP behind this

1249
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,400
design is unique. The IP behind this

1250
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
design is unique and also patent

1251
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,200
pending. What we believe is that there

1252
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,800
is completely opportunity around the

1253
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,839
designs. We're going to license this

1254
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,760
thing. Silly music to my ears. And do

1255
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,720
you have the ability or the contacts to

1256
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,800
go out and license yourself? Oh, we do.

1257
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,880
So then I I'm trying to figure out why

1258
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
are you here? You're asking for 500,000.

1259
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,280
What are you going to use that money

1260
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,680
for? Uh 250,000 we would like to use for

1261
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,079
scaling production on the X+1 to get our

1262
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,000
costs down. So inventory. And then the

1263
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,079
other 250,000

1264
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,760
uh is to finish development of phone

1265
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,200
drum. Okay. Well, look, what value add

1266
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,480
you? I've heard enough. I'd like to make

1267
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,400
you an offer. I'd like to start things

1268
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,920
out here because you I've been looking

1269
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,000
at this market quite a bit for the last

1270
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,079
month and I think you have some issues

1271
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
around licensing I could really help you

1272
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,319
with, but I think you need more money.

1273
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,640
I'm going to give you 750,000 for 25%.

1274
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,560
And Kevin, coming into the Cuban zone,

1275
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,359
no royalty, no nothing. I was straight

1276
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,119
up turned over a new leaf straight. in

1277
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,160
his

1278
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:09,839
heart that day. So 750,000 for 25%. Wow,

1279
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,520
guys. He increased your value to 3

1280
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,880
million bucks. I appreciate that. You

1281
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:19,800
know what I smell? I smell a nasty nasty

1282
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,800
shark fight. It's about to happen.

1283
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,440
I'll offer you a million dollars for

1284
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,440
25%.

1285
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,839
I'll I'll raise mine to a million as

1286
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,359
well.

1287
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,000
I'll give you a million for 20%.

1288
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:36,319
What? Damn. Yeah. So, your value just

1289
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,319
doubled. All right, I'll do the same

1290
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,240
thing. A million for 20%. Wait, slow

1291
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,640
down. Slow down. Hang on. Maybe we

1292
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,200
should go step out in the hall. We

1293
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,119
should also step out. Before you step

1294
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,800
out in the hall, we contemplated this as

1295
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,800
an opportunity and it's a fantastic

1296
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,559
opportunity. We believe everything is

1297
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,720
about team. That's why we are a good

1298
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,480
team because talk. So, let me just

1299
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,680
unpack this. I want to do a team deal

1300
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,960
because I know that there is a big

1301
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,440
nasty vulture somewhere here being

1302
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,720
quiet. So if you guys want to talk about

1303
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,920
what he's going to say, here's my

1304
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,640
suggestion. Is there capacity to do a

1305
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,040
syndicate where we get each and every

1306
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,359
one of you participating in your own

1307
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,720
unique ways? Oh, I'm interested in that.

1308
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,400
I'm interested. I'm interested in that.

1309
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,960
For what value? That's very rare in the

1310
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,240
Shark Tank. I need enough equity to make

1311
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,480
a difference. Charles, what would you

1312
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,490
say that dollar is for you and the

1313
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,640
equity?

1314
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,640
[Music]

1315
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:36,760
So, so I think a 10 million

1316
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,280
valuation. Whoa, whoa, whoa,

1317
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,559
whoa.

1318
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,559
Guys, how did you go from 2.5 million to

1319
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:49,240
10

1320
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,240
million? I smell greedy people now.

1321
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,200
Charles and JD came into the tank with a

1322
00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:00,079
$2.5 million valuation for their drone

1323
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,000
company XC. But with interest from four

1324
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,040
sharks, they've increased the company's

1325
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,440
valuation to 10 million. I smell greedy

1326
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,440
people now.

1327
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,640
You know, I used to tell my daughter

1328
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,680
this this uh little story. Why didn't

1329
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,359
the baby crab want to share his food?

1330
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,720
And the answer is because he was just a

1331
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:23,440
little shelfish. Right. I I can't

1332
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,599
counter for everybody here, but I don't

1333
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,000
I don't think this is worth more than $6

1334
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,520
million. I don't believe. So, he that's

1335
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,760
good feedback. He got a ceiling and

1336
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,559
that's helpful. I think that ceiling for

1337
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,079
me is 5%. I got to have 5% minimum.

1338
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,680
That's the smallest position I've got in

1339
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,359
anything that I'm working hard on. So,

1340
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,599
let me ask you a qualifying question. Is

1341
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,359
there any one of you that is not

1342
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,359
interested in participating because that

1343
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,760
will help address that problem pretty

1344
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,559
quickly? I I'm interested. But I see a

1345
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,960
lot of oil and gas security, all kinds

1346
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,400
of applications for I'm interested. I'm

1347
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,760
not interested. Mark, are you

1348
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,920
interested? We all get Well, I don't

1349
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,040
know. Mark's not saying. He hasn't said.

1350
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,119
We'll see.

1351
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,640
Um, I think it'd be good. Let's step out

1352
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,640
the chat. Okay. All right. Thank you.

1353
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,000
Just want you guys to be clear. There's

1354
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,200
a lot of privacy issues. This isn't a

1355
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,720
slam dunk. It's your call.

1356
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,280
I think we should try to get them all at

1357
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,680
a 6 million valuation for 25%. If

1358
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,359
there's five of us, simple math, we each

1359
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,960
have to put up 300,000.

1360
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:28,640
Mark, I don't know. What's your

1361
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,200
reservation, Mark? I don't know. I want

1362
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,839
to hear what they have to say.

1363
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,359
All right, we're excited. We're mostly

1364
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,119
excited about doing something together.

1365
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,520
Okay. Do you have something to propose

1366
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,520
to us? We do. Yes. We would we would

1367
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,480
like to

1368
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:47,040
propose $1.5

1369
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,720
million each at 5% equity and bring all

1370
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,280
the sharks in. You're willing to give up

1371
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,000
25% of the company. We each put up

1372
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,079
300,000 for

1373
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,200
5% 25% total. That gives you a $6

1374
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,880
million valuation. I'm okay with this

1375
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,040
deal. I'm one shark. I would do that

1376
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,040
deal. I'm okay with that deal. I'm okay

1377
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,839
with that deal as well. Okay, Robert.

1378
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:14,400
Then I'm in on that deal, too, Mark.

1379
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:16,400
What are you doing? You guys are smart.

1380
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,920
Did anybody else offer you money prior

1381
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,280
to this? For sure. Okay. Yeah. And so

1382
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,119
when someone's come to you, what were

1383
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,800
the discussions?

1384
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,559
There's really two categories of

1385
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,400
conversations. One is strategic and one

1386
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,920
is kind of pseudo institutional. A lot

1387
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,800
of the institutional guys want to kind

1388
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,240
of shape it like a early stage VC

1389
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,240
structure. Not something we're as

1390
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,319
excited about doing. You all have a lot

1391
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,200
more operational execution experience

1392
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:43,680
respectfully than many traditional early

1393
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,520
stage VC guys and you also cover a

1394
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
spectrum. You cover a variety of

1395
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,079
different areas which is really useful

1396
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,760
to the business cuz that's the whole

1397
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,520
model. Charles, I think that's so smart.

1398
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,640
I deal with a lot of VC guys like we all

1399
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,079
do and I got to tell you they're all

1400
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,599
super smart. They're all great theory

1401
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,440
but they don't get their hands dirty in

1402
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,520
running businesses. That makes a lot of

1403
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,839
sense. All right, Mark, are you in?

1404

[Music]

1405
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,800
That works. All right.

1406
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,559
Really excited.

1407
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,160
We should do a special party where we do

1408
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,599
a little flight party. Absolutely. We

1409
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,280
got a Shark Tank syndicate. Can you

1410
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,839
believe it? You guys are going to own

1411
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,160
this market. Thank you guys. Thank you.

1412
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:27,640
We're thrilled. All right.

1413
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,640
Well done, man.

1414
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:32,559
[Music]

1415
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,359
Next up is a modern version of an

1416
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,359
important health

1417
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,760
[Music]

1418
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:47,440
accessory. Hey Sharks, my name is Justin

1419
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,559
Wang. I'm here today to ask for $500,000

1420
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,920
for 1% of my company,

1421
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:55,760
Lark. Have you ever noticed that funky

1422
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,559
smell coming from your reusable water

1423
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,319
bottle? I bet you have. And if you're

1424
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,599
like most people, you do what we call

1425
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,680
the sniff

1426
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:08,079
test. Wee. The average reusable water

1427
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,800
bottle contains more bacteria colony

1428
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,520
than your dog bowl or toilet seat. No

1429
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,520
wonder they stink. And it's no wonder

1430
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,920
it's so tempting to reach for a

1431
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,400
singleuse plastic water bottle. The

1432
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,040
result, over 1 million of these guys are

1433
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,359
consumed every single minute. And that's

1434
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,920
no good for your health and even worse

1435
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,760
for the

1436
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,720
environment. That's why we invented the

1437
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,440
Lark Bottle. The Lark Bottle is the

1438
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,319
world's first self-cleaning water bottle

1439
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,720
that purifies water on the go. With a

1440
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,880
simple press of a button and in just 60

1441
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,319
seconds, the Lark Bottle activates our

1442
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,040
patented UVC LED technology, Pure Abyss,

1443
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,800
to eradicate

1444
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,920
99.99% of harmful and odor-causing

1445
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,240
bacteria, viruses, and mold. The result,

1446
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,800
pure water from a pristinely clean

1447
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,359
bottle. So, Sharks, who's thirsty for a

1448
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:05,520
great deal? Just want to be clear. I

1449
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:07,200
heard you properly. 500,000 for 1%.

1450
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,280
That's correct. Robert, congratulations.

1451
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,520
Highest valuation ever requested in the

1452
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,520
Shark Tank. You seem like a reasonable

1453
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,920
human being. Tell us why it's a By the

1454
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,160
way, in all I have a couple of these.

1455
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,160
Oh, you do? Great. That is awesome. I

1456
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,160
do. But what's the market opportunity

1457
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,160
that justifies this? So, it's a huge

1458
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:28,079
market. Big water is a real thing. It's

1459
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,800
a $300 billion market worldwide of which

1460
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,480
reusable market is only 7%. It is

1461
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,160
growing. I tried to swear off of

1462
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,079
single-use plastic water bottle several

1463
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,520
years ago. I bought several reusable

1464
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,800
options and sure enough they ended up in

1465
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,200
the back of the cabinet or in my gym

1466
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,359
bag. They would collect mold. If it sat

1467
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,200
in my car, it would get stinky. So, it's

1468
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,839
the self-cleaning part. Self cleaning

1469
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,839
and purifies. It looks to me like you

1470
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,319
have a UV light in the top. Can you

1471
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,079
explain how this works and what it does?

1472
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,000
This is actually an optical system

1473
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,240
that's designed to reflect the UV light

1474
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,480
inside. So simply you press this button,

1475
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,760
the UV light turns on. My co-founder is

1476
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,440
a PhD in physics from Caltech. He's

1477
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,839
engineered this to bounce the optical

1478
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,319
light throughout the bottle. So then how

1479
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:12,240
many minutes does it take to do that? We

1480
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,760
have two modes. Our normal mode is 60

1481
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,119
seconds and then we have adventure mode

1482
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,280
which is 3 minutes. So if you want to

1483
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,720
take it to a developing country or

1484
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,319
camping or you're just somewhere where

1485
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,240
you don't quite trust a water. Justin,

1486
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,760
is it safer than boiling water? It would

1487
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,880
be the equivalent of boiling your water

1488
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,200
for like 20 minutes. Really competition.

1489
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,359
Are you the only one that has UV

1490
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,839
activation and cleaning? We launched in

1491
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:36,160
October of 2018. We're the first one on

1492
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,960
market. We have about 10 patents, both

1493
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,799
utility and design around this product

1494
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,640
and other products, but there are

1495
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,480
copycats out there that we're pursuing

1496
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,559
potential legal actions for right now.

1497
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:51,200
So, Justin, why is it worth $50 million?

1498
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,720
So, we launched this product in 2018.

1499
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,559
So, we've been on the market for a

1500
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,559
little under two years. Two years, huh?

1501
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,960
Under two years. And in our first full

1502
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,960
year in 2019, we did a little over $5.5

1503
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,599
million in sales. There you go. In the

1504
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,359
last 12 months, we've done over $9

1505
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,280
million. This year, we're planning on

1506
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,359
doing $14 million. What you going to

1507
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,359
make on the 14 million? So, we brought

1508
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,119
on our first outside venture capital

1509
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,760
round earlier this year in January, and

1510
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,280
we leaned into growing the business. So

1511
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,720
this year we're expecting to lose about

1512
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,359
a million dollars. Justin, how much did

1513
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,440
you raise? 6.7. At what valuation? At a

1514
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:26,799
$31.7 million valuation. So Justin,

1515
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,559
let's talk real business. You've only

1516
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,839
raised 6.7. How much do you have in the

1517
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,280
bank? Uh, I have about 6.5.

1518
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,480
Okay. So you really haven't had to spend

1519
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,079
anything. Good for you, right? Yeah.

1520
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,359
What do these retail for? The one you

1521
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:42,319
have right there is 95. I paid 95 for

1522
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,599
this. Yeah. See, even Holy crap. It's

1523
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:46,160
actually not bad. It cost you what to

1524
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:48,799
make it. The land. ended cost is around

1525
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,480
40. You said you had a lot of patents.

1526
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,319
What are those other products you

1527
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,920
already have? Well, some of those

1528
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,839
patents just cover some other

1529
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,160
applications, but some of them do apply

1530
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,240
to the new product. Uh, this is the lark

1531
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,359
pitcher, which is our first foray into

1532
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,280
the home. Let me do that real quick. And

1533
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,119
while that's going, I'll show you a

1534
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,760
video of how that works. Traditional

1535
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,200
water pitchers use a filter. And the

1536
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,119
biggest problem is that they only trap

1537
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,040
contaminants where they could quickly

1538
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,040
accumulate and multiply and actually

1539
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,200
reverse contaminate your water. Why do

1540
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,480
they reverse contaminate? Because the

1541
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,400
contaminants are being trapped and

1542
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,319
collected there and as germs are growing

1543
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,920
there. It's a wet porous environment

1544
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,520
that's dark. So imagine all the things

1545
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,440
that could be growing there. So we take

1546
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,119
a two-step approach. The first step you

1547
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,920
see it go through and it captures things

1548
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,280
like lead, cadmium, mercury. In the

1549
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,040
second step, you simply press this

1550
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,040
button and it'll purify the water that's

1551
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,440
gone through. And as you can see, that

1552
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,799
is a clear water that we poured blue

1553
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,559
water in. That's contaminated. Clear

1554
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:46,240
water. But is anybody else doing this?

1555
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,760
No one's doing this. There's a million

1556
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,000
people on planet don't have access to

1557
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,400
clean water and 1.5 million don't have

1558
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,760
access to electricity. So I don't think

1559
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,599
any of those people are getting this

1560
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,920
bottle right now because they don't have

1561
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,920
$95. 1% of all of our proceeds go to our

1562
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,640
charity partner, 1% for the planet,

1563
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,839
charity water, wellare where we build

1564
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,839
wells in Africa. 1% of profits. 1% of

1565
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:12,720
revenue we pledge of revenue. Oh, gross

1566
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:14,880
revenue. Gross revenue. 1% that that is

1567
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,720
that is impressive off top line. I mean,

1568
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,319
you're committed. I get it. That that is

1569
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,920
important. Damon was going to stick a

1570
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,599
skewer through you. No, I I might still,

1571
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,440
but I want to just lay it out where I

1572
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,359
am. Okay. I think we're at a time where

1573
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,680
people are really angry. They're they're

1574
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,839
looking for hope. Mhm. And when I signed

1575
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,599
up to this platform, the platform didn't

1576
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:36,079
start off as the wealthy helping the

1577
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,400
wealthy with 6.5 million in the bank. I

1578
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,760
I just could not do this cuz I just

1579
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,359
think that I'm here for a different

1580
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,839
reason. I think this is crazy. I'll let

1581
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:48,160
the other sharks discuss it, but I'm I'm

1582
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,839
out. I also come from a background where

1583
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,040
I didn't have a lot. It's unfortunate

1584
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,960
you won't take that journey with me, but

1585
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,799
I respect what you're saying. So, let me

1586
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,559
take a shot at it. I support a charity

1587
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,920
called One Drop. making sure everybody

1588
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,920
can drink fresh water around the world.

1589
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,040
It's something I can get behind. Love to

1590
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,160
be involved in this, but I'm not doing

1591
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,400
it for 1%. I bring too much value. I've

1592
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,680
never done a deal for 1% for obvious

1593
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,400
reasons. I'll do it for 4%. I don't care

1594
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,400
how you structure it, advisory shares,

1595
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,599
whatever. So, you want him to do it at

1596
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,920
almost onethird of his I understand. I

1597
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,520
didn't say you would like it, Mark, or

1598
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,520
you would. I'm just telling you what I

1599
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,440
would do. Is there other offers out

1600
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,960
there where, you know, to give you half

1601
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,880
a million dollars for 1%? I I feel like

1602
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,880
I'm not making anything. The category

1603
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,839
that we're in is gigantic. It's a $300

1604
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,359
billion industry and it's so ripe for

1605
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:40,799
disruption and so ripe for innovation. I

1606
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:44,240
think I'm willing to take offers and

1607
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:46,000
listen to it offer, Lori.

1608
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:50,599
I would love to work with you. I would

1609
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,599
love it. 500,000 for 5%.

1610
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,280
You keep on going backwards, Justin.

1611
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:57,920
Justin, the problem with 1% is you're

1612
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,000
priced for perfection. And yes, I would

1613
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,440
love to own 1% of Apple and I would love

1614
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,640
to own 1% of Tesla, but the odds are

1615
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:10,400
just so low. To make it easier for your

1616
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:12,720
investors, I'll do 500,000 for 3%. We

1617
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,520
can work out the other 2% for from your

1618
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,119
advisory pool. That's my offer. And

1619
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,960
Mark, are you anywhere? Yeah, I know

1620
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,160
where I'm at. Um, so look, there's

1621
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,000
different platforms for different

1622
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,920
reasons, right? This is a place where

1623
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,680
people come where they just need a

1624
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,000
little bit more fuel. They need a little

1625
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,760
bit of help. We're not here to evaluate

1626
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
companies that may be billion dollars in

1627
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,559
sales over a trillion dollar market in

1628
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
20 years, which is possible, but this is

1629
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,720
not the place to do it. So, for those

1630
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,480
reasons, I'm not. So, you have three

1631
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,400
offers. What do you want to do? You

1632
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,400
know, the the offers are all great, but

1633
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,079
even without the advisory shares below

1634
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,359
my last valuation of 32ish, right? To be

1635
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,480
honest with you, that's really my bottom

1636
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:56,880
line. What about we got you all in for

1637
01:01:52,480 --> 01:02:00,480
half million each for $1.5 million total

1638
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,119
at 4.5%. And then I will also throw an

1639
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,359
advisory share of 1% split between the

1640
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:10,160
three of you. So for a total it would be

1641
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:12,240
5.5% for that money. 2%. Yeah.

1642
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,079
Okay, here's something we'll do. Would

1643
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,000
you consider a million and a half or 6%

1644
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:20,319
and each shark gets

1645
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,559
two? If you get three sharks, huge value

1646
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,200
for you.

1647
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,119
Two sharks are out and Justin has one

1648
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,359
offer on the table from Kevin, Lorie,

1649
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:33,599
and Robert for his water purification

1650
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:37,920
company, Lark. Huge value for you. 1.5

1651
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:40,720
million, 500,000 each for 6%. Let's say

1652
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,960
you uh I could accept the offer with one

1653
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,559
condition that the structured in a way

1654
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,760
that $1.5 million for $4.5% and the

1655
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,079
remaining 1.5% would be advisory shares

1656
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,760
to be divided among you. My question is

1657
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:57,280
do I get 2% for my $500,000? You do. How

1658
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,440
long is the vesting period for the

1659
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,359
advisory shares? 24 months based on

1660
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,200
what? Forget the best. What are you

1661
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:05,359
basing? What do I have to do to get my

1662
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,720
advisory shares? I I think we just have

1663
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,000
a conversation about what we could do

1664
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,359
with the business, how we could build it

1665
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,640
together. Maybe it's QVC. Maybe it's

1666
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,160
make it very simple. It's too

1667
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,280
complicated. You know what? I'm out

1668
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,039
because I've worked really hard to get

1669
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,119
to this point. I don't need you to

1670
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,839
interview me.

1671
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,440
I I don't want contingencies on it. You

1672
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,520
know that we're going to be involved. We

1673
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,319
don't want to see that just evaporate.

1674
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,799
Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm in for 2%

1675
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:36,160
for 500,000. I'll do a million dollars

1676
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:40,960
for 4% split between you and Lori. I'm

1677
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:43,280
in. No advisory. It's just straight.

1678
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,440
Advisory would just no contingencies. So

1679
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,599
half a million dollars each for 1.5%

1680
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,160
plus half a percent in advisory shares.

1681
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:53,039
2% total. I don't want advisory shares.

1682
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,960
I I like Can you do that? Look, I want

1683
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:57,039
her part of the deal for sure. I see

1684
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,079
lots of value here. Whatever it takes to

1685
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,240
get her on board, I want the same. So,

1686
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,880
are you putting a stake in the sand here

1687
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,240
on the Yeah, I would go 2%. Okay. Well,

1688
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,480
that's what you got to do, but not

1689
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,839
advisory shares. Um, what if those

1690
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,119
shares are invested up front because I

1691
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,119
have to structure something where I'm

1692
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,960
not going below my last valuation.

1693
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,960
There's 2% up front. Done. Done. All

1694
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,990
right.

1695
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,400
Let's light up the world.

Next into the tank is an entrepreneur

1698
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,990
who believes there's big money to be

1699
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:44,400
made from big scares.

Everywhere I go, there's zombies. Hi,

1702
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:52,240
sharks. I'm Melissa Carbone from Los

1703
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:55,440
Angeles. My company is 1031 Productions,

1704
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:59,920
and I'm seeking $2 million in exchange

1705
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,920
for 10% of my company.

1706
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,000
Wow. 1031 Productions is an

1707
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,200
entertainment company that creates,

1708
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,160
owns, and produces live attractions in

1709
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,079
the horror space. Our most popular

1710
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,559
attraction is the Los Angeles haunted

1711
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,839
hay ride. And it is not for the faint of

1712
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,520
heart. Sharks, when you take our

1713
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:23,200
hayride, you are entering the pitch

1714
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:26,160
black woods where demonic forces, lost

1715
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,730
souls, psychopathic fun are waiting

1716
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,980
around every turn.

And just when you think the terror is

1720
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,559
over, think again. Oh god.

1721
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:00,960
Oh, he likes you. Don't eyeball me. I

1722

01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,640
get him. Okay, Melissa, you know what's

1724
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,160
really scaring the crap out of me is

1725
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:11,359
your valuation. So $2 million for 10%

1726
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,359
imputes a $20 million value on this

1727
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,520
scary hairride business. Tell us why

1728
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:17,520
you're worth $20 million. We do

1729
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,520
attractions all year long. We have the

1730
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,079
Los Angeles Haunted Hayride, which is

1731
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,319
our seasonal attraction here in LA. 17

1732
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,520
nights. We sell out every single night.

1733
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,079
We do about 1.8 million dollars right

1734
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,760
now per October.

1735
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:36,240
Wow.

1736
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:38,240
1.8 was really good in 17 days. 17 days.

1737
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,599
We have another attraction called the

1738
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,440
Great Horror Camp Out that we just

1739
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,200
launched, which is a summer attraction.

1740
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,039
The Great Horror Camp Out is our way of

1741
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:48,079
not being a seasonal company. It is an

1742
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:50,480
overnight completely immersive camping

1743
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,599
experience, horror themed. Oh, no. So,

1744
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,079
it's 12 hours. We b we take 2,000

1745
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,680
campers, we put them in tents, and we

1746
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,520
have an incredibly interactive

1747
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,680
experience that includes everything from

1748
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,240
a hell that's basically summer camp from

1749
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,480
hell. Yeah. 1.8 20 million in at the end

1750
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,720
of the 17 days what's left. It cost us

1751
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,559
$1.2 million to produce the Los Angeles

1752
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,880
haunted hayride. So So I'm left with

1753
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,160
600,000 free cash afterwards. Yeah. I

1754
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,520
mean it varies year to year because

1755
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,440
right now we're in a launching new

1756
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,039
attractions mode. We're launching a New

1757
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,640
York haunted hayride which is what we're

1758
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,400
seeking some of this money for. The

1759
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,319
great hor camp out. We're launching it

1760
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,079
next year in 10 cities up the west

1761
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:28,079
coast. And therein lies the rub, right?

1762
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,559
Because they're very very very expensive

1763
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,880
to to produce and create. Right. Well,

1764
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,480
camp the camp outs are cheap to produce.

1765
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,200
How much advertising and promotion do

1766
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,000
you do? We spent about

1767
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:42,160
$300,000. We do a ton of radio. My

1768
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,880
background is I I ran Clear Channel Los

1769
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,559
Angeles for 10 years. So, my um

1770
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,920
advertising marketing and one of and my

1771
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,520
other business partner is actually still

1772
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,960
with Clear Channel. So, we know how to

1773
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,039
make a dollar go really far from a

1774
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,119
market. How many unique individuals come

1775
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,520
through the hayride? We have we have

1776
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,039
50,000 people. We sell out every single

1777
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,240
night. So, this year is our first year.

1778
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,520
where we increased our max capacity to

1779
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,200
100,800. We actually are doubling our

1780
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,760
max capacity this year. You sell out

1781
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,920
every night for 17 days. Every night.

1782
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,920
That's amazing. So, can I extrapolate

1783
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,680
and say that the it's going to be 3.6

1784
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,159
million in revenue this year? Yes. If we

1785
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,239
sell out. So, that means this thing will

1786
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:20,480
generate just over a million bucks if

1787
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:21,839
everything works, right? Mhm. Okay. Now,

1788
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,120
you're an intelligent woman. I'm trying

1789
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,440
to make the leap now. We have to get

1790
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,679
back to reality on your $20 million ask.

1791
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,400
Yeah. Let's give you a fair chance of

1792
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:33,679
making a million bucks before tax. Okay.

1793
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:36,480
Yep. That's about 700,000 after tax. If

1794
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,880
I gave you a 10 multiple, you're worth 7

1795
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,279
million bucks. How is it that I am going

1796
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,120
to pay 20 for a $7 million business if

1797
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,279
everything goes right? Mhm. That's the

1798
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:49,120
horror story you've brought here. You've

1799
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:51,440
overvalued your business.

1800
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,080
We've had major entertainment companies

1801
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,799
in LA who have already given us offers

1802
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,960
to buy our company and this is about

1803
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:01,000
what they're valuing it. Why are you

1804
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,480
such a greedy pig?

1805
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,920
I not greedy. I have lots of lots of

1806
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,719
high hopes for the company and I want to

1807
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,600
grow fast. Just because a Hollywood bozo

1808
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,960
offered you a $20 million valuation. You

1809
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,080
know what the horror show is? Listen to

1810
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,120
you argue about valuation all the time.

1811
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,679
Well, then why don't you just give her

1812
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,960
$2 million for 10%. I am projecting for

1813
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,400
the New York Haunted Herid, which hasn't

1814
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,560
happened yet cuz it's the same model in

1815
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,080
LA. We're just plopping it there. Let

1816
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,520
go. Let her go. Let her go. But

1817
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,000
geographically, it's a different model

1818
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,640
because it never rains in LA. Melissa, I

1819
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,960
I I don't agree that your risk analysis

1820
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,480
is correct. It never happens that

1821
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,359
everything you roll out successful day

1822
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,359
one. That's ridiculous.

1823
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,640
For me, it is not hard to get lots of

1824
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,400
people to come to the attractions. The

1825
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,839
hard part is to make it a great

1826
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,120
experience so they want to come back.

1827
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:51,679
Look, this is all fun and games, but

1828
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:56,199
we're talking about money here. I can't

1829
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,199
I can't get there. I'm out.

1830
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,800
Melissa, for you to come close to your

1831
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:03,840
projections for next year, everything

1832
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,040
has to work perfectly all the time. I

1833
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:09,560
don't see you getting to those numbers

1834
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,560
next year. I'm out

1835
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:15,040
for me right now. how to give you $2

1836
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:17,600
million. I feel it would take a really

1837
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:21,280
long time for me to see that back. So,

1838
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,280
for that reason, I'm

1839
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:35,040
out. The risk is not as great as you

1840
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,360
probably would think. I mean, we will

1841
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,880
launch these attractions no matter what.

1842
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:43,120
I know that we can launch them faster by

1843
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,880
having this money. We can launch them

1844
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,800
now. I'm an expert in high octane scare.

1845
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,080
You are? Yes. I can tell you a way to do

1846
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,000
this much cheaper. Wear a piece of

1847
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,640
jewelry and walk around where I grew up.

1848
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,040
Yeah. That will give you a high octane.

1849
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,760
Fair enough. Uh I would just have to

1850
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,960
insult you with my offer. Um go ahead,

1851
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,199
insult her. That's about what it's

1852
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,120
worth. Throw the offer. Yeah. Okay.

1853
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:08,120
Well, then I'll give you $2 million for

1854
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,120
40%.

1855
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,899
[Music]

1856
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:26,320
Okay, Mark. Come on, Mark. Is that a yes

1857
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:28,880
or a no to him? Um, can I counter? Of

1858
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:32,880
course you can counter.

1859
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:35,440
Um, 2 million for 20%.

1860
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,199
I'll take that offer. Done.

1861
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,360
Really?

1862
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,600
Yep.

1863
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,600
Awesome. Good. We have a deal. All

1864
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:49,520
right. We have a deal. Wow. Easy breezy.

1865
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,000
I love it. Thank you. Oh, I'm so up for

1866
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,840
Holy crap. You owe me 5% for helping you

1867
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,760
on that. Totally. You can have free

1868
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,120
tickets to LA haunted hay ride. Thank

1869
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,239
you so much. Good luck. I don't know

1870
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,679
what just happened. Wait a minute. I

1871
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,520
lost out on a deal. Come to think of it.

1872
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,520
Yeah, you just did.

1873
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,199
I think that the next generation of

1874
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,120
entertainment is experiential

1875
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,800
entertainment where people get out of

1876
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,719
the house and go and get a unique

1877
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,880
experience. I thought for me to get my

1878
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,239
money back if I did that deal for 2 mill

1879
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,679
I'd have to rise from the dead and look

1880
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:20,000
like that before I get You already have

1881
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,640
Kevin. Are we excited? Are we excited?

1882
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,960
Mark on board and $2 million. This is

1883
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,960
the biggest deal ever. I'm so excited.

1884
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:31,040
This changes the game for us. Wow.

1885
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:35,000
Next into the tank is a modern version

1886
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,000
of a traditional machine.

1887
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:41,080
[Music]

1888
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,400
Hey Sharks, I'm Brian Shimmerlick and

1889
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,800
I'm Steve Bofield. We're from New York

1890
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,600
City and our company is Veno. We are

1891
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,440
seeking $2 million for 12% of our

1892
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,480
company.

1893
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,440
When you hear vending machine, what

1894
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,280
comes to mind? Most people imagine

1895
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,520
desperately shaking this old machine

1896
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:06,480
trying to get that bag of potato chips

1897
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,199
to drop out. These machines are huge.

1898
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:12,239
They're old. They're ugly. And so they

1899
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:14,560
get hidden in the basement. Veno is

1900
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:16,560
taking vending out of the basement into

1901
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,080
the spotlight with the latest

1902
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,600
technology. So what's so different about

1903
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:23,840
Veno? Everything. Let's start with size

1904
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,000
and appearance. Our slim form factor and

1905
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,480
attractive design is the ticket to

1906
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,239
exclusive hight traffic areas. Veno

1907
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,280
hangs on the wall like a picture frame

1908
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:36,239
and requires zero floor space. Let me

1909
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:38,400
show you how it works. What Veno does is

1910
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:40,320
we bring video content to the point of

1911
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,920
purchase. So Brian will go ahead and

1912
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,840
browse the products. Looks like the

1913
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,080
bottle breacher has caught his eye. He

1914
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,679
adds it to the cart, clicks checkout.

1915
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,159
Wait a minute, Brian. I don't see any

1916
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,040
slots for coins. Veno is totally

1917
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,840
cashless, totally digital, and very,

1918
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,840
very fast. Once the payment is made, our

1919
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,920
team at Veno back in New York is

1920
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,760
automatically notified of the sale. And

1921
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,679
that's just scratching the surface of

1922
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,840
everything we can do with the valuable

1923
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:08,400
data from each and every vending machine

1924
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,400
out in the

1925
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:14,880
field. It's that easy. Who's ready to

1926
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,520
veno?

1927
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,280
So, it's small in size. Yes. Does that

1928
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,000
mean that anything that you sell out of

1929
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,840
it has to be small in size? Absolutely.

1930
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,679
This is about the largest item that we

1931
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,760
can fit, but we can actually fit a 100

1932
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,679
products. How do we fit so much and so

1933
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,679
little is we have an amazing team of

1934
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,199
aerospace engineers. Is he an aerospace

1935
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,719
engineer? Yes, that's my background. I

1936
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,480
was an aerospace engineer for about 9

1937
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,520
years. What happened to you? And now

1938
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,880
you're making vending machines. Now I'm

1939
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,400
making vending machines. I saw the

1940
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,440
opportunity. I quit my aerospace job and

1941
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,280
I jumped to the See what happened with

1942
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,040
the space program. We're not a vending

1943
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,960
operator and we're not replacing vending

1944
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,360
machines, but we are a software and

1945
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,920
media company that manages this digital

1946
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:55,040
network from the cloud. So, here's our

1947
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,800
business model. We sell the hardware to

1948
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,600
vending companies. So, let's go from

1949
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,880
there. So, let's go from there guys. So,

1950
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,880
let's go from there. What is one of

1951
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,360
those cost for me to buy if I'm a

1952
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,360
vending machine guy? What does it cost

1953
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,760
you to make? Yeah, you're not going to

1954
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:15,360
love this. So, bear with me. We build it

1955
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:17,040
for 2500. We sell it for 2500.

1956
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,320
Okay. So, you charge a monthly then. So,

1957
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,600
what do you charge on the monthly then?

1958
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,600
We charge you $20 per Veno per month.

1959
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,520
And what do I get for that $20? You get

1960
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,040
the front-end software that controls the

1961
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,000
hardware. Do I Does that include

1962
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:32,719
maintenance in case it breaks? Exactly.

1963
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,600
So, then do do the different companies

1964
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:37,760
that you sell this to select and choose

1965
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,320
what's going to go in the machine? We

1966
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,719
control the media rights and we control

1967
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,560
a significant amount of the product mix.

1968
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,640
And so you can get some of your products

1969
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,480
in as the owner of the hardware, but

1970
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,640
we're also managing this network

1971
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,199
remotely working with really great

1972
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,280
products to get them into the venos

1973
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,120
across the whole network. What are your

1974
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,520
total sales for this year? We're going

1975
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,000
to generate a million dollars. Wow. We

1976
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,239
just partnered with the largest vending

1977
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,120
machine company in the country. But

1978
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:09,360
Brian, you make money from the front of

1979
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,120
the screen. You're an ad company.

1980
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,400
Absolutely. Plain and simple, right? Let

1981
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,600
me tell you what you guys what we're

1982
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:18,320
doing here. We are changing the game on

1983
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,280
retail and marketing physical products.

1984
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:24,880
That's a stretch. Traffic into stores is

1985
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:26,640
down 50% over the last 3 years. The

1986
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,520
impulse purchase at the checkout at the

1987
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,679
grocery store is down significantly.

1988
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,440
Brian, so I'm an advertiser. I want to

1989
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,280
advertise on the front of the screen.

1990
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,520
How do you charge me? So, we charging

1991
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:41,920
brands

1992
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:44,880
$200 per skew per machine per month.

1993
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,600
What that gets them is that's a lot. We

1994
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,440
actually purchase the product wholesale.

1995
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,960
We sell it retail. We make sure our

1996
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,880
vending partners can make an attractive

1997
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,640
margin and the product is a guys. Look,

1998
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,480
I get it. This is a digital end. This is

1999
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,239
a digital end cap, right? Which is

2000
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,800
great. But here here's my issue. I

2001
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:03,280
invested in a company called Oasis. Five

2002
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,600
women out of Boston. They go into

2003
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,199
women's restrooms. All the products are

2004
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,520
women's. Now, we've designed our own

2005
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,719
box. I see them as competitive. So, for

2006
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,960
those reasons, I'm out. Understood. Why

2007
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,480
don't you talk about this $16 million

2008
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,120
valuation you put in front of the Sharks

2009
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,960
here? 2 million for 12.5%. I'm going to

2010
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,800
make the assumption that's not supported

2011
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,480
by cash flow because you don't have any.

2012
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,840
So, it must be some other reason you

2013
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,440
think you're so valuable. It must be

2014
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,640
that you have have you raised the money

2015
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,400
or or we raised $3.4 $4 million from

2016
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,159
some of the best investors out there.

2017
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,080
The best investors in America right

2018
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:38,239
here. Exactly. That's why we're here.

2019
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,480
And we always get great pricing. I make

2020
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:42,320
sure of that. I know you do. Just

2021
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,239
explain to me how it's worth 16 million

2022
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,520
today. You might do a million in sales

2023
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,440
this year. Will you make any money on

2024
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,560
that million? No, we will not. We will

2025
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:53,280
lose about 300,000. Uh and then next

2026
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,120
year we will break even. And so why is

2027
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,840
it worth that much? We've got an amazing

2028
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,360
team and we've spent three years

2029
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,880
building out this platform. I've

2030
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,800
partnered, let's not forget, I've

2031
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,800
partnered with the largest vending

2032
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,560
company in the country and we've

2033
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,480
partnered with the nation's largest

2034
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,800
chocolate manufacturer as well as

2035
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:13,840
several other big brands. It's very

2036
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,080
smart to have point of purchase video if

2037
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,640
you can have it in something. But on

2038
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,719
here, do they have to be relative to

2039
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,679
what's inside the machine or are you

2040
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,760
selling advertising space to anything?

2041
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:28,640
We're focused on the differentiator. The

2042
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:31,280
differentiator is coupling retail point

2043
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,760
of purchase with media, extracting tons

2044
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,920
of data about how consumers behave.

2045
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:39,920
Guys, the valuation is

2046
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,679
insane. I'm out.

2047
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,640
Thank

2048
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:46,320
you. I I don't like

2049
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:48,239
it. What I find confusing about it is

2050
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,840
you're in the advertising business and

2051
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:52,560
there's a lot of competition for point

2052
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,320
of sale advertising, but you're also

2053
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,560
selling product, but you're only selling

2054
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,560
products that are in the machine. And

2055
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:02,159
one day, maybe if you get big, you'll do

2056
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,880
advertising for other things, too. So,

2057
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,760
is it a display advertising company or

2058
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,679
is it a pseudo vending? This business

2059
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,280
model is just too complicated and

2060
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:15,040
unfocused for me. I'm out.

2061
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,360
Guys, can I ask if your balance sheet

2062
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,960
has any debt on it? We have absolutely

2063
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,600
no debt. How would you like some?

2064
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,199
Three sharks are out, but Kevin may be

2065
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,000
interested in Brian and Steven's

2066
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:29,760
high-tech vending machine, Veno. Guys,

2067
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,159
can I ask you if your balance sheet has

2068
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,199
any debt on it? We have absolutely no

2069
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:38,239
debt. How would you like some? I'm open

2070
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:40,719
to it. I'm open to hearing what you got.

2071
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,239
What about I lend you? This goes into my

2072
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,400
venture debt fund. and I give you $2

2073
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:45,840
million and I'll take 6% of the company

2074
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:50,320
in equity, which is half of what you

2075
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:53,679
asked. So 2 million in debt. Yeah. And

2076
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:55,199
I'll loan the company a 36-month loan, 3

2077
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:57,679
years. That's enough proof of concept

2078
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:59,600
here. 2 million. And I want 6% of the

2079
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,120
equity for providing the facility.

2080
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,880
That's why they call it Mr. Wonderful.

2081
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,560
And there's no interest payments on the

2082
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,000
debt. And there's no strings attached.

2083
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,480
Are you kidding? It's a fund. It has to

2084
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,440
make at least 7% is my lowest rate.

2085
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,120
Horrible. Here's Mr. advice with no

2086
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,719
checkbook. Isn't that wonderful? No

2087
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,400
one's written more checks or bigger

2088
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,080
checks on this show than I have. And I'm

2089
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,480
telling you, well, you already know it's

2090
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,920
horrible. I have a venture debt fund.

2091
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,400
This is what I do all day long with tech

2092
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,840
companies. So, Mr. Wonderful, how did

2093
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:31,120
you calculate 6% on the equity side? I

2094
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,960
just asked for it.

2095
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,640
It's just what he wants. I just want to

2096
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,960
wet my beak in the equity and I deserve

2097
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,080
to. That's a big old beak. I love my

2098
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,320
beak.

2099
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,480
I look at this and it's a little

2100
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,640
confusing for me. If you're going up on

2101
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,199
a wall, right, you're taking up that

2102
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:49,440
space. So, the space below it now is

2103
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:51,600
empty. I don't see why you wouldn't

2104
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,159
lengthen that. It's a little odd to me

2105
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,360
at the moment. Like, I I personally feel

2106
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:58,560
it needs some work. Lori, is it possible

2107
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,400
given that we're asking for a

2108
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,080
significant amount of money, is it

2109
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,239
possible that you guys would consider

2110
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,520
coming in together? Have you guys ever

2111
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,520
partnered up before? I think I'll bring

2112
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,040
you in on that deal, Lori. I mean,

2113
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,760
you've raised a lot of money. You're

2114
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,800
asking for a lot of money. With 3.4

2115
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,360
million, we've built a network of 150

2116
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,719
machines soon to go to 250. We've

2117
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,960
partnered with the largest vending

2118
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:23,760
company in the country. The vending

2119
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,719
market is a large, slowmoving industry.

2120
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,360
It's 7 billion. So, there's a lot of

2121
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:31,360
opportunity here to create retail. So,

2122
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,840
if I go in with Kevin at the deal that

2123
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:37,280
he offered you and I'd be happy to do a

2124
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,440
debt deal with you, but the the 6% is is

2125
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:43,440
Where's your counter? My counter offer

2126
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:46,719
would be 2 million at a 7% interest rate

2127
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,719
for 1% equity. Oh, it's not 1%. I don't

2128
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:50,400
get out of bed for that. But also too,

2129
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,159
we work really hard for our money. It's

2130
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,760
huge to get hard for our money, too.

2131
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:58,000
It's huge to get two sharks. You're

2132
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:01,199
asking for a lot of money, though, guys.

2133
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,679
1% is a no. Yeah, that doesn't work.

2134
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:05,600
Ryan, another counter.

2135
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,040
That's my last counter. 1% of equity.

2136
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,560
That's all you're willing to give up.

2137
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,320
I'd love to make a deal with you guys,

2138
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,719
but it's got to be in the rain. Hang on.

2139
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:16,800
He's about to make another counter. I'll

2140
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:19,440
do the deal. $2 million, 7%, 36 months,

2141
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,760
3% equity. You got to pay something for

2142
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,600
two sharks. Well, hang on. Is Lori in on

2143
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,520
that?

2144
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,199
4%. Four. You do it. Two each. four.

2145
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,040
Okay, here's the deal. We'll give you

2146
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,600
the $2 million. I've spoken to my

2147
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,320
partner Lori. You get two sharks. It's a

2148
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,560
7% interest loan for three years, which

2149
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:41,280
is enough to prove your concept. And we

2150
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:44,000
want when we close the deal with you, 4%

2151
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,400
equity, 2% each. It's a done deal, my

2152
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,920
friend, if you say yes.

2153
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:51,840
So, we we know the venture debt market

2154
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,600
and what's market is a little bit

2155
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,800
higher. The difference venture debt from

2156
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:59,120
any firm is one thing. venture debt from

2157
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,040
Mr. Wonderful and Lori, Queen of QVC.

2158
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,440
Yeah, that has huge value to you. You

2159
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,960
become the IT kids. You're a Shark Tank

2160
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,560
deal. You've got two sophisticated

2161
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,679
investors from Shark Tank who care about

2162
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,120
you and you come into the Shark Tank

2163
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:13,639
ecosphere. All of a sudden, you're on TV

2164
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,920
every day. Good pitch.

2165
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:17,280
So, I'm going to provide one more

2166
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,840
counter and this would be our best

2167
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,920
offer. We can't give up 4% equity.

2168
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,400
What's your counter, Brian? It would be

2169
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,080
2 and 12% of the equity and we'll pay

2170
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,520
you back and we'll work to set the terms

2171
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,239
that you guys are comfortable with.

2172
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,760
Three and a half%.

2173
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,360
Three and a half%. We're doing at 3 and

2174
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,360
1/2.

2175
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,360
Ooh.

2176
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:42,159
3 and 1/2% is really too much for us. 2

2177
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:45,560
1/2% is final offer. And we'd love to

2178
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:45,560
have you guys.

2179
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,600
We're going to make money back.

2180
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,880
Okay, look. Last offer and you should

2181
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,440
take this. You'd be foolish not to.

2182
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,440
We'll do it for 3%.

2183
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,320
You got a deal.

2184
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,080
Wow. I didn't think that would happen.

2185
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,239
Thank you guys. Very interesting.

2186
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,679
Excited about this. Thank you. No

2187
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:15,920
problem. Next project. Thank you so

2188
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:17,679
much. Thank you. Thank you.

2189
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,239
We're really excited to have two sharks.

2190
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,880
Kevin's going to bring us his financial

2191
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:24,960
wizardry. Lori's got her portfolio of

2192
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,639
products. We've built a big business

2193
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,920
over the last three years, but we're

2194
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,000
really just scratching the surface of

2195
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,920
what we want to achieve. And so, we're

2196
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:36,480
ready to go to the next level.

2197
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,480
[Music]

2198
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,320
Next up is an entrepreneur who believes

2199
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,310
he has a better solution to drinking

2200
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:49,440
wine on the go.

2201
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:51,520
[Music]

2202
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,360
Hi Sharks. My name is Andrew McMurray

2203
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,600
and I'm here from Scarsville, New York.

2204
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,000
Our company is Zips Incorporated. I'm

2205
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:01,159
here today seeking a $2.5 million

2206
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,080
investment for a 10% equity stake in our

2207
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:06,480
company. I'm here to tell you that our

2208
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,639
single serve is like no other in the

2209
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:11,520
wine industry. our company. It's all

2210
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:14,639
about packaging, packaging, packaging,

2211
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,080
and licensing, licensing, licensing. And

2212
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,320
Kevin, I think that should be music to

2213
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,639
your ears. You are our wise grasshopper.

2214
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,480
So, the single serves that are out in

2215
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,320
the market today, what you might be most

2216
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,560
used to that you've seen on airplanes,

2217
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,920
the little airplane bottles, little

2218
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:32,080
plastic cups. We've got a wine glass.

2219
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,320
It's got weight and it's got strength.

2220
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,679
This glass is actually so strong that I

2221
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,600
can stand on it.

2222
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:41,520
Oh my god. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow is right.

2223
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,719
To open this glass of wine, you're

2224
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,120
simply going to unzip the outer clean

2225
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:48,800
wrap. This recyclable outer wrap acts as

2226
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:51,600
a UV protectant to the wine, which in

2227
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,760
single serve wine, shelf life is king.

2228
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:58,000
Now, to open the wine, you're simply

2229
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:59,920
going to unscrew the lid.

2230
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,320
Attach it to the bottom. Very clever.

2231
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,440
Now, that's great. To open the wine,

2232
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:07,440
you're simply going to lift and peel.

2233
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,600
One of the best parts about this now lid

2234
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,520
comes back

2235
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,880
off screws back on. This glass falls

2236
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,120
over. You're not spilling any wine out

2237
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,920
of it. So, let me quickly give you guys

2238
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:19,600
each a glass so you can hold it. In our

2239
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,360
opinion, our package is going to become

2240
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:26,000
to the wine industry what the aluminum

2241
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:28,239
can became to the soda industry.

2242
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,080
Cheers. Cheers.

2243
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:31,520
So for viewers out there and you Lori

2244
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,400
who weren't around when this happened,

2245
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,960
Copa Deina was another single serve wine

2246
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,280
deal that came in the tank twice. Both

2247
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,600
time got offers and he never accepted

2248
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,840
either of them. Andrew, why is it

2249
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,880
different than Copa Deino? It's

2250
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,199
different in that we own the patents and

2251
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:52,800
Copa Deino assured us they have patent

2252
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:54,920
on sealing a glass of wine this way. So

2253
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,120
how have you not breached that patent?

2254
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:59,360
Actually, the company that owns the

2255
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,040
rights to that glass and to that

2256
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,800
technology is a company based out of

2257
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,639
France. In speaking with the owner of

2258
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,800
the company, he told us that the

2259
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,360
previous entrepreneur essentially he's a

2260
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,400
like a franchisee. So, he had the rights

2261
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,840
to use his technology for his glass. So,

2262
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,080
what is the difference between your two

2263
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,480
patents? The shelf life. That's you know

2264
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,040
what it boils down to. Our glass lasts

2265
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,120
for well over a year shelf life. We're

2266
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:27,280
in shelf life testing right now with

2267
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:29,120
three of the top 10 global brands in the

2268
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:31,840
in the world today. One I can tell you

2269
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:33,440
about which is Yellowtale. They do up

2270
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,280
close to 10 million cases a year in the

2271
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,360
US market. So what I'm trying to clarify

2272
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,000
with certainty because been down this

2273
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,280
road long time ago and by the way you're

2274
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,440
doing better than the other guy cuz he

2275
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,440
was sweating like a pig by this point.

2276
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,840
The point is you're telling me after

2277
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,679
having visited the owner of the patent

2278
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,679
that there is no breach. They have

2279
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,080
agreed that you do not infringe on their

2280
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,080
patent. That is 100% correct. Is your

2281
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,800
patent unique not only to the form

2282
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:01,600
factor but also to coat the glass with

2283
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,920
that plastic? Correct. The mix of the

2284
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,880
plastic that's in here is proprietary to

2285
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,239
us. That's with the exterior package.

2286
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,000
The exterior that's also a part of the

2287
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:11,440
patent is the UV wrap, the shrink wrap

2288
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,040
on the outside. So those two things

2289
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,600
Okay. Okay. Let's put the patent aside

2290
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,920
for a moment. You you have no desire to

2291
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,719
make your own wine. You want to license

2292
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:24,080
this packaging to other big wine

2293
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,920
manufacturers and let them sell it? The

2294
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:29,280
answer would be no and yes and yes and

2295
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,639
no. So we actually have our Zips brand.

2296
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:33,360
That's what's in front of you right now.

2297
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,719
That is our brand. Is it in Costco? Is

2298
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,480
not in Costco yet. And that's a big

2299
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,400
piece of why I'm why I'm here talking to

2300
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,320
you today. What are your sales? Okay.

2301
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,400
The project started about 16 months ago.

2302
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:45,760
We were working with Fatser Winery. The

2303
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:47,600
deal with them was to get into six major

2304
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,199
league baseball parks for opening day of

2305
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,199
2013 and we did $130,000 with them in

2306
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:55,280
licensing fees. They took your

2307
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:57,280
technology and put their wine into it

2308
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,480
and sent it over to the arenas. Correct.

2309
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,400
We got the license. Correct. What was

2310
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,639
the percentage on that license? It's 15

2311
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:05,600
cents a glass. How much money is totally

2312
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:08,560
invested in this venture right now? $8.5

2313
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,400
million. Oh, wow. And where did that

2314
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,800
money come from? We got about 25

2315
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,800
investors total. We've got six retired

2316
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,120
Goldman Sachs partners, three of which

2317
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,960
own a professional sporting franchise.

2318
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,880
And the rest of this group, these are

2319
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,080
all Wall Street professionals. But the

2320
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,679
question becomes, if you have all those

2321
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,159
team owners, then why are you asking us

2322
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:27,600
for the money? I want all five of you

2323
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,639
guys at the table with me. What's the

2324
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,239
sell through? Or what's your total

2325
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,840
sales? The Zips brand that you're

2326
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:34,560
holding in your glass right now. We're

2327
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,800
currently done about $650,000 in sales.

2328
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,840
What does it cost at retail? A glass of

2329
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,360
Zips. $2.99. Look, per glass. Very few

2330
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,960
people will buy a glass of wine for

2331
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,480
three bucks. We're already in,200

2332
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,400
stores. We just got Walmart this week.

2333
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,000
What's it cost you to make? It cost me

2334
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:53,199
95.

2335
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,520
Look, in America, 97% of wine is sold

2336
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:57,679
for under

2337
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:59,920
$9.95 a bottle. So, where this packaging

2338
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:02,719
idea has so much merit in terms of its

2339
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:04,639
delivery, it fails on its pricing. When

2340
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,880
the average consumer says to himself, I

2341
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:10,159
can get five and a half glasses for

2342
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,159
$9.99 and I have to pay $3.99 for one.

2343
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:15,280
That's the problem. Yeah, but this is,

2344
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:17,760
you know, but the you can't dismiss like

2345
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:20,400
650,000 in sales, my friend. That's

2346
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:22,480
nothing in the wine business.

2347
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,120
I mean, everyone we've spoken to is

2348
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,239
comfortable at the

2349
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,719
299 point. They haven't tested the

2350
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:32,080
market. They haven't sold it through.

2351
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:34,960
650,000 and 1,200 stores is poo poo poo

2352
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,960
poo. Peep poo poo. Let's not get hung up

2353
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,239
on though. We're now I'm hung up. I know

2354
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,480
it's getting delisted. It's not going to

2355
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:42,960
work. We're talking about my brand.

2356
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:43,800
Look, I'm not a wine connoisseur. But

2357
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,600
even

2358
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:50,719
then, I would take MD 2020 from a

2359
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:54,480
quality perspective over a brand with a

2360
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:56,320
zipper named Zips. Huge mistake. I'm

2361
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,080
out.

2362
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,239
Let me tell you a very brief story that

2363
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:02,239
I think will be sobering for you. I went

2364
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:04,000
to see Costco and talked to them about

2365
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:07,440
wine. They're the largest buyer of wine

2366
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,800
on earth. 5.2 billion in wine. I said,

2367
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,560
"I'm going into the wine business." They

2368
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,560
said, "Who cares? There's 5,000

2369
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:15,120
applications a year to put wine from all

2370
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,880
around the world into Costco. Go prove

2371
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:20,239
that means something in the wine

2372
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:23,120
business." Took me 2 years to do it. I

2373
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:26,159
go back to Costco and she says,

2374
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,239
"Impressive. But now you have to deal

2375
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:30,880
with a new price point. We talked about

2376
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:33,040
single serve. We talked about 750ml

2377
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,800
bottles. We talked about my brand. Did

2378
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,320
you get your wine into Costco? I'm

2379
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,600
negotiating it right now. It's not in

2380
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,000
yet. That's a good question. That would

2381
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,840
be a no. Okay. What is your loss going

2382
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,120
to be this year? We I don't want to look

2383
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,480
at it as a loss. I want to look it as a

2384
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:48,880
reinvestment back. Why not simply

2385
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:51,280
license to the big manufacturers, to the

2386
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:53,520
big wineries, and let them take all of

2387
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,520
that? You're putting up enormous amounts

2388
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,800
of capital. That's not the purpose of a

2389
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,280
licensing deal. Why do any of it? Well,

2390
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:04,159
I mean, hindsight is always 2020. That's

2391
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:06,880
the answer. Now, is it Now he's too far

2392
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:09,040
in. He's got no choice. Okay. So, at the

2393
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,840
price of 299 that you want to sell it

2394
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:13,840
at, if you don't get the sell through up

2395
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,800
to call it 10 million units in the next

2396
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,960
2 years, you're screwed. You've run out

2397
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,560
of runway. So, the real issue is getting

2398
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,560
back to how we started our conversation

2399
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,120
today. When we know everybody in

2400
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,159
America, which is

2401
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:32,480
97% buy wine at

2402
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:34,239
under9.99, that's 97% of the market.

2403
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,520
And and where's that fact from? I

2404
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,639
Everything I'm telling you is a fact.

2405
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,199
You're going to go find this out on your

2406
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:40,719
own. My gut feeling is I would not feel

2407
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:44,639
comfortable investing this amount of

2408
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:46,719
money with this amount of risk. I'm out.

2409
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,080
But to obviously I respect that and I

2410
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:50,320
appreciate it. But you know to open a

2411
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,080
category that's never been done before

2412
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,159
isn't easy. It's been done before. The

2413
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,920
guy's been standing there twice. He was

2414
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,360
here twice to clear the air in that

2415
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,199
sense. I mean we're not a copycat. I've

2416
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:02,080
been doing the single serve wine since

2417
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:04,560
2008. I think brilliant design. I love

2418
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,080
it from my perspective. I think that

2419
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,000
there's a great use for it in certain

2420
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,159
applications. But all the rest of this

2421
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,480
is so complicated. You have so many

2422
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:17,280
partners. so much money that for that

2423
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:20,480
reason I can't see my way through this

2424
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:22,480
and so I'm out.

2425
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,719
You know when Copa Deina was here I

2426
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,880
really like the product then I like the

2427
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:29,520
better product cuz I think you have a

2428
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,199
better product but my issue is exactly

2429
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:34,080
the same as it was. I don't care that

2430
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:36,400
you've raised 8.5 million for me it is

2431
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:38,880
very very fundamental. It's a licensing

2432
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,560
deal. I don't understand why we're

2433
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,480
having this discussion. Kevin's going to

2434
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,159
beat the crap out of you because you

2435
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,679
can't get below a certain price point.

2436
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:47,480
But you can't get below a certain price

2437
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:50,159
point because you've taken on all the

2438
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:52,239
risk. If you were simply licensing it,

2439
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,600
that would be somebody else's problem. I

2440
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:54,920
don't like the path that you're going

2441
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,600
down. I'm

2442
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:00,000
out. All right. Look, Costco is the

2443
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,880
number one buyer and reseller of wine on

2444
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,960
Earth. Period. Everything about selling

2445
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,880
wine in America is known by their buying

2446
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,719
team. Which brands, which varietals,

2447
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,320
what price point, what packaging,

2448
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:13,400
everything. They know

2449
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:16,560
everything.

2450
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:19,679
Everything. They don't like this price.

2451
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:24,560
If I team up with you, I can get this

2452
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:26,239
into Costco, but not at that price. You

2453
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,719
want to do $12 million opening order

2454
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:30,719
from California alone, it's $149. You

2455
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,760
want to do a $19 million a year business

2456
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:37,360
with Costco, it's $149. I can make it

2457
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:40,320
happen. I can get you in Costco.

2458
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,400
Four sharks are out. Kevin is Andrew's

2459
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:45,840
last chance for a deal for his single

2460
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:48,800
serve wine company, Zips. So, how do you

2461
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:51,560
get the price down so that we can sell

2462
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:54,239
to Costco for

2463
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,040
$16? How do we do that? You've got to

2464
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:58,880
get the the packaging down. And like

2465
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,800
anything, when it goes to scale, we feel

2466
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,360
we can keep driving it down. All right,

2467
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,800
I'll make you an offer. Here's the only

2468
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,880
way I'm doing your deal. I'm not

2469
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,719
interested in going down the path you're

2470
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,760
going down trying to prove out a 299

2471
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:11,440
product cuz I know it's not going to

2472
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,000
work. I'm two years ahead of you. Okay.

2473
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:15,440
I want to go launch it in Costco. Do you

2474
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,440
understand the value of the offer of

2475
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,040
getting into Costco? Absolutely. Okay.

2476
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,480
So, what are you going to do? I'll give

2477
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,360
you $2.5 million for 10%. But I want the

2478
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:27,840
option to buy another $2.5 million worth

2479
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:32,270
of equity at exactly a $25 million

2480
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,080
valuation in the event of an exit.

2481
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:35,760
[Music]

2482
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:38,480
Which means if you sell the company for

2483
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,320
50 million, I still get to buy it at 25.

2484
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,920
You get

2485
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,920
it? I've got to have some upside for

2486
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,520
making your company so valuable that you

2487
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,360
can sell it. And of course, all of this

2488
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,880
only happens if we get into Costco, so

2489
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,719
you have nothing to worry about. Do you

2490
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,840
understand it? Yes, I do. I'd like to

2491
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:53,679
have an opportunity to make a quick

2492
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,760
phone call to check with the investors.

2493
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,760
All right.

2494
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,040
These wine guys drive me crazy. I think

2495
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,920
they're nuts not to do your deal. It's

2496
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:07,520
just a potential deal with Kevin. Kevin

2497
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:10,480
only. Kevin only for Okay. for for a 10%

2498
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,840
equity stake in the company. And here's

2499
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,360
here's the twist and the kicker. So,

2500
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,120
obviously, we need to discuss this. Do

2501
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:17,760
you see this as your way of you getting

2502
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:22,280
into Costco? Yeah. But, this is the best

2503
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,280
offer Kevin's ever made to somebody.

2504
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:29,520
Okay. So, in speaking to the partners,

2505
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,639
they were intrigued. It wasn't the angle

2506
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,639
they thought that you would be coming in

2507
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:34,560
at. I deserve to buy stock at a $25

2508
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,480
million valuation, Andrew, cuz I brought

2509
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,920
Costco to the table. Because we got into

2510
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,679
Costco, all of a sudden, you're way more

2511
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,280
valuable. Your partners know that you

2512
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,840
should do this deal. You have no risk.

2513
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:46,480
Just say

2514
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:48,639
yes. Trust me,

2515
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:50,320
Andrew. It's actually a very good deal.

2516
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:53,360
Andrew, are you going to take my deal or

2517
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:56,320
not? Don't be a fool.

2518
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,880
I'm on board. I'm here. All right.

2519
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,880
Cheer. Yay.

2520
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:06,679
Grab me a very expensive plastic glass

2521
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:06,679
and toast me. Cheers. Thank you guys.

2522
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:11,159
Oh, ho ho.

2523
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:17,679
Hello, Sharks. My name is Ethan Tucker

2524
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,159
and I'm from the beautiful Green

2525
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:23,520
Mountains of Brattleboroough, Vermont.

2526
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:26,320
And I'm Pat Boon, aging singer and like

2527
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,840
you, a lifelong entrepreneur. Our

2528
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:33,360
company is Zero Pollution Motors and we

2529
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:37,199
are seeking $5 million in exchange for

2530
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:40,159
50% of our company. Our goal is to give

2531
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:42,560
to America the leanest, cleanest,

2532
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:44,800
greenest form of auto transportation

2533
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:48,480
ever to hit our crowded, polluted

2534
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:52,159
cities. So, Sharks, it is my great

2535
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:57,119
pleasure to introduce to you the air

2536
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:59,760
car. The what? The car that runs on air.

2537
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:02,320
Wow. That's right. Air, but highly

2538
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,639
compressed air.

2539
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,719
There it is. Air, of course, is the

2540
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,560
least expensive, most readily available,

2541
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:11,360
and the most environmentally perfect

2542
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:14,000
fuel there will ever be. And the AirPod

2543
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:17,760
uses compressed air to drive the pistons

2544
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,480
in the engine. It is far superior to the

2545
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,880
electric car because of its price. And

2546
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:25,440
it eliminates the need for batteries,

2547
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,520
which are expensive and inefficient.

2548
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,719
Look at that thing go. Now, this is a

2549
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,159
picture we took, which is not totally

2550
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:34,639
life-size. This is just the first

2551
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:38,239
prototype. And so, how many want to join

2552
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,920
us for a dazzling ride into the future?

2553
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:42,000
Look, Pat, I know you've sold over 40

2554
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,320
million records. They say I didn't get

2555
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,760
paid that many, but yes. What was your

2556
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:48,000
biggest hit? I'm just curious. Love

2557
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,320
Letters in the Sand.

2558
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,719
You know, I love cars. I do. I race

2559
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:56,000
cars. What made you think I wouldn't

2560
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:58,080
want to get in it and try it? Well, why

2561
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,840
isn't it here? I know. We would like you

2562
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,000
to be in it. And there's several

2563
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,679
reasons. One is that a car to come into

2564
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
the United States has to meet safety

2565
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:08,159
standards. It has in Europe already. Oh,

2566
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,080
so this is already a production car. It

2567
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,600
is moving into production. That's You

2568
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,119
bought the license to it or you want to

2569
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,960
buy the license? We have the right to

2570
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:17,440
build the first plant in the United

2571
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,840
States. So, Ethan, where explain how

2572
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:21,920
it's powered? Is this compressed air? It

2573
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,400
is compressed air. It is not a

2574
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,560
combustion principle. It is a propulsion

2575
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,000
principle. Now, a crude way to

2576
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:31,920
illustrate would be blow up a

2577
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,800
balloon, it takes off. Pat, how how fast

2578
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:37,960
does a lunchbox on wheels

2579
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:39,920
go? It will go about 50 mph tops. Is it

2580
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:41,840
self-perpetuating? In other words, is

2581
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,520
there a certain amount of compressed air

2582
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,080
within the vehicle to last a certain

2583
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:49,040
amount of time? You plug in the AirPod

2584
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:51,920
to any outlet. Okay. And takes 4 hours

2585
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:53,840
to charge. The motor charges it itself.

2586
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:58,000
It compresses the air. How long does it

2587
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:59,440
last? You have 100 miles range. I'm a

2588
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
consumer. I'm coming to a store to buy

2589
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:03,280
an air car or a battery car. Tell me why

2590
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,080
I'm going to buy the air car. There's

2591
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:08,320
one big difference other than the price.

2592
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,320
Tell me. I'll tell you. The difference

2593
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,760
is if there's a compressor at a gas

2594
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:14,719
station, just like you fill up your

2595
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,199
tires, you can fill up your car in 4

2596
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:20,239
minutes. 10,000.

2597
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:22,719
10,000 for the car cost $10,000. The car

2598
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:24,639
cost 10,000. That's it. That's it.

2599
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,600
Something's wrong here. No, because it's

2600
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:29,600
very simply made. The inventor, you may

2601
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,440
know the name Ghee Negra. Yeah.

2602
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,760
Titanium. Isn't he the guy who developed

2603
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:36,560
the titanium piston? Titanium for the

2604
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,639
lighter motor. He's got 150 patents. He

2605
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,320
knows. He's a real car guy. He loves

2606
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,760
cars, right? What will it cost for you

2607
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,040
to bring a car here? Manufacture it

2608
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,400
here. I thought we're going to

2609
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:47,040
manufacture in Hawaii. Yeah, we're going

2610
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,840
to manufacture states. The 5 million is

2611
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:52,800
for a plant to build regional plant to

2612
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:54,880
build the cars. Why Hawaii? Hawaii is a

2613
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,040
sort of enclosed community where they

2614
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,280
have pollution problems. They have high

2615
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,679
cost of gas and and it's more of a

2616
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:03,840
controlled place. Part of the concept of

2617
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:06,000
the company is not a big Detroit type

2618
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,880
plant. It is regional plants, small

2619
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,560
plants building cars for that area.

2620
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,800
Okay. Pat, can you share what it's made

2621
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,840
out of? Fiberglass, polyurethane, and

2622
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,840
resin. You can jump on a door and it

2623
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:21,360
won't bend like a regular car. But what

2624
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:23,760
about um in a crash test? So, we can't

2625
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:25,280
pass a crash test until we've crashed a

2626
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,880
car. And we don't want to crash a

2627
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:28,800
prototype.

2628
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,119
We only have three prototypes. So, we

2629
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:33,199
would be crashing testing some a car

2630
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:35,840
that was built from scratch. $5 million

2631
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:37,679
to build your factory in Hawaii. Then

2632
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,880
you have to market it, right? And you

2633
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,639
not only do you have to let people know

2634
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,400
it exists, you have to convince them

2635
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:44,639
that they can trust it. Yeah. That's

2636
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,480
exactly why we're in Hawaii because we

2637
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:48,159
want to do it slowly. Okay. So, your

2638
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:50,480
license is not for all the United States

2639
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:52,880
on an exclusive bas. The company's

2640
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:56,480
called MDI and they've just made a deal

2641
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:59,760
with Tata Motors for India, a $30

2642
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:02,880
million deal. So, they wrapped up India

2643
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,800
and the MDI company has all of France.

2644
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,800
So, they're only issuing a couple plants

2645
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,400
per territory, areas, regions. Yeah.

2646
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,719
Just so we can be crystal clear on the

2647
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:12,560
opportunity. Yeah. I'm assuming that I

2648
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,960
become a 50% partner in a plant in

2649
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,760
Hawaii and that I own that entire

2650
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:19,840
territory. Every car sold on every

2651
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,920
island in Hawaii is coming from that

2652
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,520
plant. Is that true? Yes. No. But if

2653
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,520
somebody builds a plant in San Francisco

2654
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,440
and ships a car into my territory,

2655
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,119
cannot happen. Cannot. Guys, guys, I'm

2656
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:31,440
going to simplify things here, right?

2657
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:33,360
The smart thing as an investor is to

2658
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:36,080
just watch what happens with Tata Motors

2659
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:38,000
in India. See how it sells. Look at

2660
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:40,320
their experience. And then if it goes

2661
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,920
good, watch somebody else open up a

2662
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,600
plan. You're too late. This is happening

2663
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,960
right now. This wave is If it was

2664
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,400
happening right now, you wouldn't be

2665
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:50,560
here. You'd already have the money and

2666
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:52,800
have the plan open. Guys, I'm out.

2667
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:56,000
The strategy of trying to buy a license

2668
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:58,320
for a single plant is almost ludicrous.

2669
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,840
If you can't tie up an entire region,

2670
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:03,199
you're buying the right to become a

2671
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,280
dealer in Hawaii. You've got to lock up

2672
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:06,719
all of United States. Do you have $200

2673
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,239
million you'd like to plop down for

2674
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,320
that? You become the pioneers. You

2675
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:12,159
establish a region for 5 million, prove

2676
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,679
the model, and somebody else scoops the

2677
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,360
rest of the country. That makes no sense

2678
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:18,000
to me as an investor. We will be the

2679
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:20,800
first. I get it. The inside connection

2680
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,800
to MDI. I can go to MDI and simply do a

2681
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,360
deal right now without you for New York.

2682
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:28,480
Well, here's here's my answer to that.

2683
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,920
Try because they don't want my car in

2684
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,600
New York or my money. No, they don't

2685
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,320
want to be double crossed. There's a

2686
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:36,159
there's a trust factor. You could not go

2687
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:38,800
directly to Ghee and say, "I'm going to

2688
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:40,719
plop down $5 million and and completely

2689
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,880
double cross us." Yeah. You know what?

2690
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:45,440
Push comes to shove, their company gets

2691
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:47,280
in trouble and Kevin comes along with a

2692
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:51,760
$5 million offer for the rice. $5

2693
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:54,480
million to to ghee is small potatoes.

2694
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:56,880
The way to make this work is to sit down

2695
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:59,520
and come up with a national strategy for

2696
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,199
the entire US market and then package

2697
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,639
that up and bring it to investors.

2698
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:04,159
You're trying to build a bakery before

2699
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,000
tasting the cake. That's right. But

2700
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:07,280
we're going to allow others to taste the

2701
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,040
cake. That's what they've been waiting

2702
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,920
for. I know the challenges of all the

2703
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:14,639
legal issues bringing product to market

2704
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,560
like this. It could take forever and

2705
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:20,080
it's too early for me without your

2706
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:22,400
ability to actually get clearance uh to

2707
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:25,760
have this operate in America. So because

2708
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:28,080
of that, I'm out.

2709
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,159
You know, I like green products. I think

2710
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:33,600
that this compressed air concept could

2711
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:35,679
be a hero. Um, but for me, you would

2712
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,560
have to have had the rights to all of

2713
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:40,360
the USA for me to really be interested.

2714
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,880
I'm

2715
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:45,199
out. Your deal doesn't make a lot of

2716
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:47,840
sense for a shark at all because the

2717
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:49,920
return expectations on this are far in

2718
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,560
the future. It's a monumental task.

2719
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,840
Nobody wants to launch this in Hawaii.

2720
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,239
I'm certainly not going to do it. I

2721
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:58,080
think I've articulated why. You may have

2722
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:59,920
a shark who is so ingrained in the

2723
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:01,199
automotive industry, he may be crazy

2724
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:05,239
enough to do it. We're going to find out

2725
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:05,239
right now, but I'm out.

2726
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:12,719
Four Sharks are out. Robert is Pat and

2727
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,520
Ethan's last chance for a deal for their

2728
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,960
airropelled vehicle, Air Car. I've

2729
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,719
invested in a lot of things and I'm

2730
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,320
willing to invest in this, too. Look,

2731
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:22,480
I'm interested. I'm I'm really

2732
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:26,040
interested. Annie is full of hot air.

2733
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:29,199
Yeah. It's a lowcost commuter car for

2734
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:32,159
$10,000. Big market for that. Mhm. The 5

2735
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:33,920
million isn't that much considering the

2736
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,280
size of this market. This is not

2737
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,520
something you're going to sell one state

2738
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:39,679
at a time, my friends. The minute you're

2739
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,840
successful in Hawaii, somebody is going

2740
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,560
to lock up the other stuff. I don't want

2741
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,960
to make air cars in Hawaii. I want to

2742
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,360
bring this to the American market.

2743
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:52,440
I'm happy to give you $5 million for the

2744
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:55,440
right to go and sit at that table and

2745
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:57,360
negotiate a distribution deal with the

2746
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:00,960
people who own it. So, I'm giving you $5

2747
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:03,520
million for 50% contingent on being able

2748
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:05,760
to negotiate an Americanwide deal. And

2749
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,679
if you don't get that deal, what's

2750
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,639
contingent on that? Cuz I don't think

2751
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:14,159
the 5 million goes away. Gee, Neg would

2752
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:17,119
be thrilled to have you make a deal with

2753
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:19,199
him and I feel very certain that that

2754
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:22,080
number could come down because

2755
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:23,520
ultimately having the US rights is the

2756
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,840
golden goose. Why are you even

2757
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,760
hesitating? Well, I want to add one

2758
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:29,280
other Phillip that you you you would be

2759
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,960
purchasing and that is the golf cart.

2760
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:32,719
Pat, you got to stop selling. Don't talk

2761
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,960
yourself out of a deal. You got to make

2762
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:35,960
a decision.

2763
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:42,719
Deal. We have a deal. Oh my gosh. Yeah.

2764
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,480
I want an honor to meet you. Thank you.

2765
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,239
You are the perfect perfect person. I'm

2766
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,719
the perfect person for this. I love

2767
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:51,280
cars. Thank you so much. Congrats. Thank

2768
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:53,440
you.

2769
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:56,800
When you're dealing with the reinvention

2770
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:58,960
of the motor, that leap of faith is the

2771
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,840
leap that people who are on the ground

2772
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,920
floor have to take. And we've been

2773
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,800
proven right for our for taking the

2774
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,320
jump. High five, Robert. I like that.

2775
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:11,880
