00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,959

to say I didn't even have to blow out

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,520

can't blow out any candles cuz his Mt is

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,840

watching when we were setting them off

122
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,720

Santa giving my dad head on Christmas

Eve that's a real confession that wasn't

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Santa no way that was probably your

147
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,600
mother even if it was Santa I feel like

148
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,759
he would have sprinkled some magic like

149
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,840
dust so you didn't see him do it you

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,919
know no way Santa's letting you he's

151
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,720
delivering presents all these [ __ ]

152
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,160
years but someone's going to catch him

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,560
giving someone like no if we're catching

154
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,280
Santa it's in the act of giving gift

155
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
under a tree I giving anyway I don't

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,520
celebrate Christmas but I celebrate

157
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,080
Hanukkah and a couple years ago I

158
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,919
celebrated Hanukkah at my aunt's house

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,720
and my cousin shot me in the mouth with

160
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,880
a play gun and two of my teeth fell out

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
and I end up the [ __ ] what type of play

162
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,919
gun was it a BB gun Dark Gun I feel like

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,240
if you do anything with something light

164
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,880
with enough passion it would do some

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,960
action

166
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,880

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,280
to make someone if you really want to

183
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,280
hurt them I was more shocked at the fact

184
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,680
that it made someone bleed but we can go

185
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,479

186
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,120
download hold on I would download x-ray

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,039
apps to see what so that I could see

192
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,520
what my gifts were but it never worked

193
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,240

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,080

getting so angry and tired of getting

200
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,639
rocks one year I wrote a letter

201
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,440
explaining all the horrible things I

202
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,840
would do to him if he brought me more

203
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,319
rocks basically sent him a death threat

204
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,720
you didn't learn your goddamn lesson

205
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,199

207
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,479
[ __ ] death note and how about I'm

attitude oh let me brighten up the day a

212
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,400
death threat to Santa is never going to

213
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,319
help you get what you want I used to put

214
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,479
oatmeal outside my porch for the

215
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,639
reindeer and I would always catch my dad

216
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:18,159
eating it oh [ __ ] gross was he on the

217
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,560

oatmeal oatmeal disgusts me and I don't

220
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
even think the [ __ ] reindeers want it

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,479
why are you giving the reindeer

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,479
something they don't want and give them

224
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,120
they're S as reindeers they probably eat

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,039
cookies probably when I was like eight

226
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,640
or nine I was snooping around for my

227
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,000
Christmas gifts because my sister said

228
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,399
she would give me one of her gifts if I

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,839
told her what she got for Christmas what

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,399
a stupid [ __ ] godamn exchange I was

231
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,959
looking for Christmas gifts but instead

232
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,480
I found my mom's toys and other strange

233
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,320
artifact in a drawer and walked out

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
traumatized and completely forgot about

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,839
my hunt for the G gifts my level of

236
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,240
curiosity ended that

237
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,959
day stop looking any of that the word

238
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,399
artifact through me yeah artifact really

239
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,079
threw me off yeah like what is there a

240
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,360
vase or something or hieroglyphic

241
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,680
password to get into the thing literally

242
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,160
I don't know if it's crazy enough but I

243
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,800
found I find the amusement of going to a

244
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,480
shopping center on Christmas Eve like

245
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,079
the that very morning I go alone to walk

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
through the hallways and just stare at

247
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,360
the last minute Christmas Chaos I may be

248
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,640
insane but I love you yes I think you

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,240
are I kind of love that I think you if I

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,839
saw someone just stalking in a [ __ ]

251
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,480
mall not a particular person but just

252
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,519
loving the pure chaos that is last

253
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,320
minute christas like you are weird I

254
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,560
kind of love that that so like if I got

255
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,240
a group of friends that were on the same

256
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,240
crazy enough mindset as me I would

257
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,880
absolutely do this that's actually like

258
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
really troubling to me like I'm kind of

259
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,760
stick to my stomach let me read it again

260
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,240
if I like if I knew who wrote that I'd

261
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
avoid them at all costs they go on to

262
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
CHR they go to the shopping center on

263
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,399
Christmas Eve like that very morning and

264
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,640
walk alone through the hallways and just

265
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,880
stare at the last minute Christmas the

266
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,600
typ the type the way it's typed out too

267
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,240
like imagine walking I just picture her

268
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,320
walking through the hallway with like a

269
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,920
big old black long trench coat and

270
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,200
glasses brings them a smile watching I

271
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,480
just like I just think about all the

272
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,440
like other things you could be doing to

273
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,839
celebrate on Christmas Eve then go watch

274
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,560
like I know she's murmuring under her

275
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,480
breath like as people run out like last

276
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,920
minute like oh she's

277
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,279
like that's actually [ __ ] creepy my

278
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,839
mom and dad got married when I was like

279
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,720
8 years old and it was close to

280
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,360
Christmas on Christmas Eve my mom said I

281
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,680
could open one gift and my dad had

282
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,399
wrapped all of them like colorcoded my

283
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,320
mom didn't know which color was mine so

284
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,320
she assumed that I knew what color was

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,079
mine I ended up opening one of my Mom's

286
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,200
gifts from my dad and it had pink fluffy

287
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,720
handcuffs and a toy in it we never

288
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,200
opened up presents early

289
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,040
again or why is your father why is your

290
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,519
father first of all why is that at

291
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,399
access to you that's a gift you give

292
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,600
someone if you must in like behind

293
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,880
closed doors AG it should never hit

294
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,720
under the chist ever ever ever secondly

295
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,120
cuz like secondly your dad colorcoded it

296
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,279
and for

297
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,920
what if she like what if she didn't open

298
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,760
it then then would would the mom have

299
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,639
opened it in front of everyone that's

300
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,440
what I'm saying that's what I'm

301
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,519
thinking Dr Christmas of 2020 two of my

302
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,440
uncles almost started physically

303
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,040
fighting because Uncle number one asked

304
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Uncle number two what year he graduated

305
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,839
college must have been a sore subject

306
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
because Uncle two literally lunged

307
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,079
across the dinner table in front of my

308
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,320
whole family and had to be held back by

309
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,360
my other family members I still have no

310
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,920
idea why that question s spurred such a

311
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,279
reaction he probably didn't graduate and

312
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,200
he feels stupid by the question damn I

313
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,480
kind of like live for like other

314
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,760
people's family

315
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,320
drama I love a little bit of chaos weird

316
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,160
no no I think it's so fun like I'd love

317
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,399
to avoid it happening in my personal

318
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,560
life but just something about two uncles

319
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,120
fighting at a Christmas Eve is just like

320
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,560
oh it doesn't get better than that

321
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
that's like the [ __ ] like would you

322
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,760
get Santa milk and

323
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,399
cookies don't get this reference at

324
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,279
all four years ago on the 25th night my

325
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,160
grandmother stayed for the night in my

326
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,920
bunk bed are we calling Christmas the

327
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,320
25th night is that what's going on here

328
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,920
I yeah

329
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,399
so 4 years ago the 25th night my my

330
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,120
grandma stayed for the night in my bunk

331
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,440
during the night my dad went to the

332
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,160
bathroom and when he flushed the toilet

333
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
my grandma got so scared that she woke

334
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,920
up thought that someone was in her own

335
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,560
bed and then so it thought that she was

336
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,839
in her own bed and that somebody was

337
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,360
bringing into her house so she started

338
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,839
screaming like crazy and while she was

339
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,519
trying to get off the bed she fell from

340
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,079
5T hitting the floor badly so she was on

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,279
the top bunk and she thought somebody

342
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,560
broke her their house she'll be fine

343
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,360
Grandma's good I can't believe she would

344
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,360
do that on the 25th night I feel like

345
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,320
old B I feel like I almost said old

346
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,160
babies I feel like elderly people and

347
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,519
like babies are just like okay with

348
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,079
anything happening like they could be

349
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,079
sucker punched in the face and they just

350
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,800
have like a fine reaction I strongly

351
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,160
disagree what this one year me and all

352
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,720
my siblings and cousins went to sleep

353
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,040
with my grandma's during Christmas break

354
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,360
and one night we were in the living room

355
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,680
and we were

356
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,920
all what you know when you sleep at like

357
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,600

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,320

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,800
Grandma's you got a

364
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,800
scent okay we were all wearing onesies

365
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
so one of my cousins was wearing a

366
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,759
unicorn one and my grandma's dog started

367
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,399
dragging her by the unicorn horn across

368
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,639
the living room and what's even worse is

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,240
none of us helped her because we were

370
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,279

371
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,320

cousin's kid wine sparkling grape juice

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
and I told them it was real alcohol and

374
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,279
they started acting crazy and told

375
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,000
everyone that they were drunk that's

376
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,199

at all the lives from the bottom I also

436
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,120

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,040
Santa you're Terri so weird once I was 6

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,279
years old oh God I walked into my

454
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,279
mother's room to grab shoes because I

455
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,839

456
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,959
the closet cuz I was saw some wrapping

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,600
paper so I was going to pick it up for

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,680
her I was going to be nice and then I

459
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,519
accidentally hit my head off the shelf

460
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,959
and my elves fell on off off the shelf

461
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,160

this just on her chest and she has to

471
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,439
get it off yeah I think this is just a

472
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,200
little bit of a venting St yeah I think

473
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,039
she just really felt like she needed to

474
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,160
tell somebody I'm sorry that's terrible

475
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,320

476
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,520
cousin when I was six was the first time

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,280
Mommy Kissing Santa Claus Christmas Eve

481
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,760
I had vivid dreams where I went

482
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,120
downstairs in the middle of the night

483
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,200
thinking I heard Santa when I got to the

484
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
bottom of the steps I saw Santa laying

485
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,840
out gifts for me along with three blonde

486
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,120
ladies in red dresses and Santa hats

487
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,640
sounds like Dad handling some business I

488
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,039
couldn't speak but I could walk around

489
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,640
and touch stuff the song I Saw Mommy

490
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,520
Kissing Santa Claus started playing and

491
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,320
they started performing this whole dance

492
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,240
routine for me while I was continuing to

493
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,039
put out presents each Lady this is a

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,799
horror movie each lady pulled out a

495
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,200
Missle tone and kiss Santa on the cheek

496
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,720
at different points in the song

497
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,640
throughout this performance I could see

498
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,120
what some of the girls were let what

499
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,480
gifts were what on the gifts were an Ice

500
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,600
Age the Meltdown DVD an American Girl

501
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,600
doll a new bike what I remember or what

502
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,400
I remember I could see vividly I gave

503
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,440
Santa and one of the ladies a big hug

504
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,080
and after pulling back they they sat

505
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,720
down on the couch I got a better look at

506
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,440
the lady's face started to look just

507
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,799
like my mother's side note my parents

508
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
are divorced so the idea of my mom

509
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,320
kissing Santa Claus wasn't really creepy

510
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,080
it was funny still weird but it wasn't

511
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,600
like I had never seen her kiss someone

512
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,159
who wasn't my dad LOL Christmas morning

513
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,080

514
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,720
upstairs and was going over how crazy

517
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,640
downstairs to the living room to start

518
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,440
opening presents the first thing I

519
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,360
pulled out of the stocking no joke was

520
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,799
none other than the Ice Age the melt

521
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,559
down DVD as I made my way through

522
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,600
presents I also found an American Girl

523
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,000
doll under the tree unwrapped but in a

524
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,400
brand new box it was crazy that both of

525
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,880
these things were in my dream I didn't

526
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,159
see the bike anywhere though it would

527
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,440
have been perfect it would have been

528
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,960
pretty hard to miss it was outside sorry

529
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,760
but it was fine because I got a lot of

530
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,039
other great stuff my mom asked me to

531
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,360
help her with breakfast in the kitchen

532
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,440
when I got back to the living room my

533
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,600
nana had rolled out this awesome purple

534
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,640
bike with white wheels and tassels on

535
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,960
the handles bar and I screamed I knew it

536
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,039
I knew it I knew there was a bike

537
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,640
somewhere at this point I'm freaking out

538
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,000
and rambling on about how I saw this in

539
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
a dream I was so excited and they were

540
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,120
so confused later on when I calmed down

541
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,840
my nana asked me how I knew I was

542
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,760
getting a bike when I didn't ask for one

543
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,880
I told her I saw it in my dreams and

544
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,919
explained that in the details of the

545
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,400
dreams as best as I could she's then the

546
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,679
one who told me I must have been

547
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,480
sleepwalking and subconsciously looking

548
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,880
for presents now for the deja vu around

549
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,760
March of April or 2007 my mom started

550
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
seeing this guy the first time I ever

551
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,640
met him and he was at my house and my

552
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,360
nana had just brought me home from dance

553
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
class guy we were all going to have

554
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,400
dinner I walked and saw him sitting on

555
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,400
the couch in our living room with my mom

556
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,159
and my jaw physically dropped I swear on

557
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,600
my papa's grave that he was the young

558
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,960
version of Santa in my dream I hadn't

559
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,720
really thought about the dream in months

560
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,000
but in that moment it felt like the

561
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,000
events were so real in that dream and I

562
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
was having dja Vu without even realizing

563
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
