00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,840
Oh, I love it. Do a chair salsa.

00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,840
[Music]

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,390
Oh, they got some moves.

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,390
[Music]

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,599
Yay.

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,760
Hola, Sharks. I'm James

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,880
Joanna from Raleigh, North Carolina.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
We're seeking $400,000 for 7% of our

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
company.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
Papa Fry Barapa is a Colombian

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,600
expression meaning

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
good people. But it also means good

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,120
potato because who doesn't love

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
potatoes? But they never seem to get the

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
center of attention. How many times have

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
you heard would you like a side of fries

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,879
with that?

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
But potatoes make everything better. And

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,960
as a couple from two very different

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
cultures, we've learned to put two

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
things together create something even

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,680
better. And that's why we created Bueno

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,600
Papa. Latinspired meals piled high on a

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,760
fat stack of hand cut made to order

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,439
gourmet French fries.

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh, it's a fiesta in your mouth and the

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,479
whole world's invited.

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,119
Each of our signature dishes start out

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,640
with 33 oz of fresh cut potatoes.

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
That's over three large potatoes in

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
every meal. No one can ever finish one

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,520
by themselves.

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,040
Our unique culinary experience combines

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
the comfort of French fries with the

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,720
irresistible Latin flavors from cultures

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,759
around the world like Colombiano. Oh,

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,040
Colia,

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,159
Mexico,

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Mexico,

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
Puerto Rico,

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
Puerto Rico,

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,119
and many, many more.

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,079
Why are you translating for me? They

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
know what I'm saying.

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,840
They don't speak Spanish. Look, Mr.

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,840
Wonderful looks confused.

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
Okay, sharks. I can't tell you exactly

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,759
what she just said, but what I can tell

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,439
you is with our bilingual menu,

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,240
customers can order in Spanish and have

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,200
a little fun at the same time. So sharks

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,520
enjoy these Buenas papas as we bring the

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
Savor sensation to America.

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
All right, sharks. Who's ready?

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
Let's go to papa.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,960
Let's try papa. All right, guys. Uh Mr.

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
Mark, what do you have there?

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,920
Yeah, I got the healthy one right here.

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,080
Well, healthy salmon makes it healthy.

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
Smoked salmon, sweet potatoes, guac, and

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
pico. That's all healthy.

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,480
I have regular potatoes, right?

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,520
Oh, you have the Carolina. That is

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
pulled pork.

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Pulled pork.

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
I've got to get through. There's four

68
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
sauces.

69
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,599
There's four different sauces. So, we

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
have a special one called Buena Sauce.

71
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
It's our housemade. It's mayo. It's

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
garlicky. It's cilantro. Delicious.

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
I just had it. It's delicious.

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
The fries are really good.

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Awesome.

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, I'm going to give you an ichiwa

77
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
karamba. It's

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
pretty good.

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
Muchas gracias. And people have fell in

80
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,680
love with this since we opened. It's

81
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,080
been an crazy amazing ride. When we

82
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
first opened up, we had $18 in our bank

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,239
account

84
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
because we invested everything

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
$18.

86
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,640
$18 because we had invested our life

87
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,000
savings. Uh we had $40,000 saved and uh

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
this company actually started in the

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
pandemic. This idea just came to mind.

90
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,440
We thought about Latin food when you

91
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
kind of go on vacation. You're in Cancun

92
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,319
or San Juan, Puerto Rico, all those

93
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
different street foods that you have

94
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
there and how good it tastes and how can

95
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
we bring it back to America and adopt it

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
on top of these fries, right? So we

97
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
serve the family. They were our test

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
dummies. They loved it. The kids loved

99
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,760
it and they said, "Uh, hey dad, can we

100
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,200
have some more?" And I was like, "You

101
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
know what? I may have a business here."

102
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
So we opened up uh July 2021.

103
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
Where did you open? in Raleigh, North

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,640
Carolina. After that $18, two weeks

105
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
later, we had 18,000 in our bank

106
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,239
account. Two weeks after that on Tik

107
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Tok, we went viral. Influencer came and

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,400
tried all of our dishes and two days we

109
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
had 16 million views.

110
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
16 16 million. And when I saw people

111
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,319
just coming and eating those potatoes, I

112
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,920
said, "Oh my god, it's working."

113
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,200
So, tell us about your background. How

114
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,560
did you guys meet?

115
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,080
Sure. We're we're actually high school

116
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
sweethearts. Really?

117
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
We met Yeah, we met the last two weeks

118
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,959
of high school

119
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
and I pursued her like nothing other. A

120
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
that's a prom photo.

121
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,360
A look at that.

122
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,040
That's us. Yeah. And ever since then,

123
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
we've been building with each other.

124
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,080
Anybody got restaurant experience?

125
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,000
Not restaurant experience. So, I've been

126
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
an entrepreneur all my life. I started

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,319
out actually working for Queen Latifa at

128
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
Flavor Unit Entertainment. And at that

129
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,159
time, um the Latin boom was going on.

130
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
So, I I pitched, how about we do a Latin

131
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
management, you know, agency. No one's

132
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,439
really like focusing on these on these

133
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
new Latin stars. And I kind of always

134
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
been into the Latin culture.

135
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
Joanne, we haven't heard from you at

136
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,200
all. Wow.

137
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
I talk a lot. Okay. You do talk a lot.

138
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,600
I did. I know this. I know this.

139
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,919
Um, well, my family immigrated from

140
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Columbia, South America in the late

141
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,520
1980s. And when I went to school, nobody

142
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
could understand me. I ended up being

143
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
placed in the back of class. I

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,280
eventually learned how to speak English,

145
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,600
right? Yay. Um, I was the first one to

146
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,360
graduate from college for my family. And

147
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
then I went back to the school where

148
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,759
they sat me in the back of the class.

149
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,639
And I worked as a teacher for 12 years.

150
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,560
Oh. Teaching at that famous school.

151
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
Talk about triumphing.

152
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,440
Okay. So, talk about this product.

153
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,840
Yes, sir.

154
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
Tell me about the cost of making it and

155
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
what you sell it for and what the

156
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
margins are

157
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
and your margins.

158
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,320
So, on average to make any of these

159
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
dishes, it it ranges about 350 per plate

160
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
cost.

161
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,199
And what do you sell it for?

162
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
On average 1350.

163
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,240
What's your overall margin?

164
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,960
Our food margins are 28%.

165
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
28.

166
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
28%.

167
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,560
It's a little light. Is that your net

168
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
profit margins or

169
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,479
That's the on average that's where it's

170
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
at. Uh 28%. Uh for our food costs.

171
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,880
Oh, no. You're saying cost of not your

172
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,720
margins, right?

173
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
Yeah. His margins are 72.

174
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay. Well, then you're okay. You're in

175
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,280
good shape. Today, are you in stores

176
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,199
like this?

177
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,880
So, that's our first store. Uh and it's

178
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
a 200 ft² footprint.

179
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Yeah. I love that.

180
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
Our first year, we did 1.1 million.

181
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
Wow.

182
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
We took all the profits from that and

183
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
invested into this store.

184
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,320
How big is that one? That one is 700

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,199
ft².

186
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
And how's that doing?

187
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
It's doing really well. So, combined

188
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,440
this year, we're going to finish at

189
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
about 2 million.

190
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
What did you make last year on the 2

191
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
million?

192
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
Sure. Uh about 200,000.

193
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
Did you pay yourself paying?

194
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,039
We paid ourselves 80,000. So, that's

195
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
what uh

196
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
120.

197
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,520
120. Mhm.

198
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
So, you have two stores.

199
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
Well, no, no. Well, we have three

200
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
stores. The third one is uh at an arena.

201
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,240
Actually, we're opening up a fourth one

202
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,960
in Miami uh this month.

203
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Where in Miami?

204
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
A Windwood Miami.

205
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
Oh, you'll kill it.

206
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, we're excited. We also I didn't

207
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,960
mention this. So we started franchising.

208
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,240
Okay. And on our opening month of our

209
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
franchising program, we sold four

210
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
franchises.

211
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
What do you charge for those?

212
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
295 for initial franchise fee.

213
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
And then how much per month per year?

214
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
8% royalty fee. 2% of that is uh

215
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
marketing.

216
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
And how long has the longest one been

217
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
out there? Is this new?

218
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
Well, this is this is brand new. Brand

219
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
new. So we just sold these franchises.

220
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,199
So what are you looking for?

221
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
We're looking for

222
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,080
besides 400,000.

223
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,520
Well, a strategic partnership to help us

224
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,880
build this brand. All right. We got

225
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,880
franchises selling. We're excited about

226
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,120
those. We know we can move this company

227
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,120
along at a nice snail plate pace.

228
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
It doesn't sound like a snail pace to

229
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
me.

230
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll tell you the hiccup though. We're a

231
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,840
young company. So when we go to banks

232
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,199
and we walk in, we're looking nice and

233
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,319
pretty and they're like, "Yeah, so we

234
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
need some money to open up a new store."

235
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
And they're like, "No, you're still

236
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
considered a startup." So that was the

237
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,080
issue. So we've been taking our own

238
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,360
profits in opening up these stores,

239
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,759
which I've learned now that it's not

240
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
healthy.

241
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
Why is that not healthy?

242
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
Because we're sucking up all the cash

243
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
flow.

244
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,720
But do you have any debt today?

245
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
70,000 of debt on the business. Not

246
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
nothing huge, right? But I think it's a

247
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
fundamental question like do you would

248
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,840
you rather grow with a lot of debt and

249
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,199
scale and maybe not make a profit or or

250
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,000
do it the way you're doing it? You

251
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,160
started this when you only had $18 in

252
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
your account and now you're running a $2

253
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
million business. I mean, you should be

254
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
so proud of that.

255
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
Thank you. Thank you. But the issue is

256
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
we want to have more speed because I

257
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
know that somebody else is going to come

258
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,280
into this market.

259
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
Listen, I think you're doing everything

260
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,280
right. I think when you race and run

261
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,720
with something like this where you have

262
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
to make sure you land in the right

263
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
places, that you do everything

264
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,479
correctly, right? It's not like you have

265
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,680
to blitz the market with it fast. People

266
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
can't copy that. I would not want to

267
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,520
speed it out there. I would not want to

268
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,080
race it. I wish you good luck, but I'm

269
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
out.

270
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
Thank you so much, Laura. Thank you so

271
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
much.

272
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,160
So, so the the fiveyear plan for us is

273
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
to open one corporate store every year

274
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
in the next 5 years, and that's going to

275
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
end up at uh at the end of five years at

276
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
$10 million. So guys,

277
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
Mhm.

278
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
running a restaurant is a hard business.

279
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,000
Once you franchise, you're in a second

280
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
business. You're in the babysitting

281
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,800
business. You're in the daycare business

282
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
because you're taking $29,500 from

283
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,759
somebody and they're buying your dream.

284
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
And when they want your help, you better

285
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,720
be there.

286
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
Mhm.

287
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
If you guys were just in this, I was

288
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,199
interested. But you're in two different

289
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,800
businesses. I think that's going to

290
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,599
crush you. So for those reasons, I'm

291
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
out.

292
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
Ah, wow.

293
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,639
Thank you, Mark.

294
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,479
So very impressive. It's delicious, but

295
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,879
frankly u with the change of my

296
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,599
lifestyle of eating, I I I I wouldn't

297
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,760
eat this. And I like to get behind the

298
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,320
products that I invest in so I can use

299
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,560
my face to push the business. You know,

300
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,919
I'm out.

301
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,599
You know what I think? I think you don't

302
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,519
really need anybody. I think you have

303
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
the whole package. You have each other.

304
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,680
You're progressing nicely and I think

305
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
you'll continue that way. So, I'm out.

306
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
Thank you so much.

307
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Thank you, Barbara.

308
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
You still have one shark left. Robert,

309
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
what are you doing? All right, guys.

310
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,200
What I've learned is if you find great

311
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
people, great things can happen. And you

312
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
guys are amazing. I mean, to go from

313
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,640
where you were, no money, to build this

314
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,360
size of business, I've been there.

315
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
Mhm.

316
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
Let's figure out this thing together.

317
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,080
Okay. Five.

318
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
The only thing I hate is the valuation.

319
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
There's no way this is worth 5.1

320
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
million.

321
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's talk about it.

322
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,959
Okay. You're making $120,000 a year. How

323
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,040
is it worth 5 million?

324
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,440
Actually, Robert, it's 5.7 million

325
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,240
valuation. Thank you, Kevin.

326
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,160
So, after Miami opens up with our four

327
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920
stores and our franchise stores, we

328
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
should be about 6 million in gross

329
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,040
sales.

330
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,360
Gross sales next year. But that's not

331
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
today. It's probably worth about

332
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
2 million today.

333
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
I'm valuing it off of what we're going

334
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
to do next year. Yeah.

335
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
Well, I'm valuing it off what it's

336
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,760
worth.

337
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
I got you.

338
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,880
Today, make us.

339
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,200
So, for me, it's about $2 million. So,

340
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,480
400,000 20%.

341
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,920
Okay. Okay. Can we counter offer you?

342
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,720
That's the beauty of Shark Tank. You can

343
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
do whatever you want.

344
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
Let's talk papas. All right.

345
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,839
The good potato.

346
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,160
15%

347
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,519
for the 400k.

348
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,959
No. 400,000 20%. You know I'm going to

349
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,880
be there. We're going to invest more.

350
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
Mhm. Let's meet halfway. 17%. Let's

351
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
close the deal. Eat some papas and let's

352
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,360
go.

353
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
400,000 20%. Let's go.

354
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
18%.

355
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,600
20%.

356
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
What do you say, honey?

357
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Gosh. Oh my goodness.

358
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,600
Squeezing the potato. Squeezing

359
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
19%.

360
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,519
Thank you, sir. Appreciate you, buddy.
