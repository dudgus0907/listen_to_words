196
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,560
trying to go for the storytelling

approach and I wanted you to know that

198
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,440

through a cornfeld waking up no you said

211
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,080
walking through a cornfield then why are

212
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,400
your eyes closed waking up in a

213

cornfield you're gaining Consciousness

214
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
your eyes are finally crystal clear for

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,599
the first time I remember quoting myself

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,560
and saying that you see like the low

217
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,039
remember that was the

218
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,759
probably I would get up I would go home

219
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,000
I would get naked and check my whole

220
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,520
body for Marks to see if the aliens did

221
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,639

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,520
after alien abduction no would it dress

226
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,400
you but you wouldn't be in human clothes

227
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,319

concern my biggest concern I my biggest

316
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,720

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,720
get out of the cornfield I'm probably

318
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,600
going to have to walk 2 to 3 Days To

319
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,560
like a street and then 2 to 3 days

320
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,560
what are you FedEx no you're the [ __ ]

321
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,040
you're the only one you're the only one

322
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,040
that put thought into the fact that I

323
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,120
said you'd be gone for a lot like you'd

324
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,639
be in the middle of a cornfield M thank

325
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,480

00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,560
find a street naked 2 3 days later I

327
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,639
