vintagey book with like brown papers

2193
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:39,440
shuffling quickly through the pages and

2194
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:41,719
like a map with like red lines popping

2195
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:45,760
out and then like it brings us over like

2196
01:36:41,719 --> 01:36:48,920
a traversal drone shot of like sea and

2197
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:51,440
woods and then into like a little

2198
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:52,600
village and then like an x on the ground

2199
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,320

2200
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:57,280
characters like that's what I see

2201
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,639
indefinitely side by side when Chris

2202
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:02,880

2203
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:02,880

2243
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:04,760
everybody watching this video I know

2244
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,880
that you might be confused on why I am

2245
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:10,400
playing you this video in the middle of

2246
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:13,639
an egg dad video but there is very good

2247
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:15,679
reason and it's going to start with the

2248
01:39:13,639 --> 01:39:20,040
second I knew we were filming this video

2249
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:23,400
you look like a like like a

2250
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:25,520
villain during the first drawing attempt

2251
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,159
knew I was not going to play fair I was

2252
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,920
going to win this Challenge and I was

2253
01:39:27,159 --> 01:39:31,480
going to be the best dad of my egg and I

2254
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,760
was going to let check see my egg is a

2255
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:36,920
phon be the bad dads that they are so

2256
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,639
the second that they cracked the eggs I

2257
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:41,520
went to the carton and I grabbed new

2258
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:43,159
eggs but before that I also made sure

2259
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,639
that there were two eggs that looked

2260
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:48,199
extremely similar to theirs what I put

2261
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:50,760
them at the bottom of the carton so I

2262
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:54,000
knew which two to grab when I went into

2263
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:55,639
my plan later in the day then

2264
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,800
when we were taking the videos of the

2265
01:39:55,639 --> 01:40:00,360
eggs to put on the screen when Nick told

2266
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:02,360
you whose egg was who I calculated that

2267
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,159
I would be the one to record the eggs so

2268
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:05,840
that I had an exact image of what their

2269
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:08,440
eggs looked like at all

2270
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:12,159
times shut

2271
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:15,639
up quiet and watch I like quiet and

2272
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:19,119
watch wait a second wait a second I am

2273
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:21,800
like I am bam Bo this is the most Rogue

2274
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:25,280
mat thing I've ever is so the most

2275
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:27,080
effort he's ever put into

2276
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,199
I culated that I would be the one to

2277
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:30,880
record the eggs so that I had an exact

2278
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:34,800
image of what their eggs look like at

2279
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:37,080
all times the next thing I did was I am

2280
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,920
always the one to clean up a mess so

2281
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:41,840
when I picked up the Sharpies

2282
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:44,040
and no quiet no

2283
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,920
quiet I made sure to take the three that

2284
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:48,800
I was going to need at the colors that

2285
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:52,000
they used I brought them to my room and

2286
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:54,320
I put them in my box lucky me I did not

2287
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,800
do this on purpose but got caught by a

2288
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:58,920
pretty easy distraction of his wallet

2289
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:02,400
being in the washing machine roll the

2290
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:04,199
clip what i is in my short your wallet

2291
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:08,440
is in your shorts I have a fear that it

2292
01:41:04,199 --> 01:41:10,040
is no I'll just leave it wow

2293
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:13,280
wow

2294
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:14,880
cooked with this now new knowledge I

2295
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,960
knew that Chris would be way too focused

2296
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,000
on his wallet and not on his egg while

2297
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,719
me and Nick already had our eggs in our

2298
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,760
pocket ready to go for the rest of the

2299
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:24,520
challenge Chris was too busy seeing if

2300
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:26,320
the track and his wallet got ruined by

2301
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:28,320
the washing machine or not so he was on

2302
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,960
his phone with him being on his phone it

2303
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:33,040
struck the perfect opportunity bring in

2304
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:36,679
myly

2305
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:38,679
drunk toet simply see that they were a

2306
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:41,639
carbon copy and switch them out and put

2307
01:41:38,679 --> 01:41:44,199
the real egg in my pocket Chris's egg

2308
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:46,719
was very easy to draw I just had to make

2309
01:41:44,199 --> 01:41:49,119
sure that the lines did not pass the red

2310
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:52,119
line of his head and make sure that his

2311
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:52,119
eyes

2312
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:55,329
[Applause]

2313
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,080
watch

2314
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:06,000
it watch shut up Nick was a good egg dad

2315
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:08,119
he sat there and held his egg while

2316
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,199
watching TV and doing everything that he

2317
01:42:08,119 --> 01:42:12,040
was doing I knew that he was going to be

2318
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:14,360
the problem and he was going to be my

2319
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:16,560
biggest competition Not only was Nick a

2320
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:19,480
very attentive father to his egg but he

2321
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,560
did a good drawing but the only thing

2322
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:24,960
that he was missing was the fact that he

2323
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:27,239
was smudging it all day long in the

2324
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:31,639
pocket out of the pocket so what did I

2325
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:33,679
do I drew his egg perfectly carbon copy

2326
01:42:31,639 --> 01:42:36,679
then I went to my bathroom and grabbed a

2327
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:38,960
face cloth and I simulated the motion of

2328
01:42:36,679 --> 01:42:41,880
taking the egg out of the pocket over

2329
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:44,199
and over and over again until I realized

2330
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,639
that the smudges will match and mine is

2331
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:49,199
honestly a little more bold than his

2332
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:51,040
then as we were eating dinner and

2333
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:53,599
cleaning the table we decided to put all

2334
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:55,760
of our eggs on the same plate Nick went

2335
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:58,040
upstairs before dinner and that was the

2336
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,280
perfect opportunity to go back into the

2337
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:02,280
room compare the eggs make sure they

2338
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:04,760
were close enough and take his and put

2339
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,960
it in my pocket and walk back to my room

2340
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:08,719
now the hard part was done the false

2341
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,560
eggs were put out into the world and the

2342
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:12,040
real ones were in my possession there

2343
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:16,440
were only two more things that I had to

2344
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:22,440
do one of them it was gruesome it was

2345
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:22,440
evil but your eggs were my breakfast

2346
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:29,360
continue no way continue watching after

2347
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,400
eating them they were very delicious but

2348
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,119
the hardest part after that was just

2349
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:34,880
making sure that you didn't fall for the

2350
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:38,560
Trap and realize that your egg was a

2351
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:40,840
phony and you guys were too CAU shut up

2352
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:43,000
most important part when you guys were

2353
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:45,440
too caught up to even think about the

2354
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,360
fact that I was smart enough to do this

2355
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:50,840
but thank you you have lost this

2356
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:54,320

2393
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,320
time I've been confused about the

2394
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:43,560
difference between Chicken Little and

2395
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:46,920
Stuart

2396
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:50,440
Little and one is a chicken and one is a

2397
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:53,199
rat and they're both little there's no

2398
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:55,719
they are not the same and I've just

2399
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:58,679
figured this out cuz Stuart Little has

2400
01:45:55,719 --> 01:46:02,280
those big ugly red [ __ ] shoes

2401
01:45:58,679 --> 01:46:05,400
on and Chicken Little got that crazy

2402
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:07,440
looking friend that girl but what's the

2403
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:10,040
point of both of those I need to I need

2404
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:13,199

01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:21,480
new conspiracy theory chicken and Stuart

2408
01:46:18,679 --> 01:46:24,760
Little are long lost

2409
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:27,000
brothers and they they are both little

2410
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:29,880

01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,239
the sky from falling I'm going home I

2412
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:34,960

and they're like an athlete

2414
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,199

01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:13,000
guys what's up um so we're I know we're

2561
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,480
in the middle of doing the scratch

2562
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,760
ticket video right now so it's weird

2563
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:19,679
that I just popped up in the middle of

2564
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:21,480
the car but the other day I said like oh

2565
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,000
if we film this video if one of you

2566
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:24,560
[ __ ] idiots get

2567
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,639
one of those fake scratch tickets I'm

2568
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,960
going to be so mad and they were like oh

2569
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,159
that's such a good idea blah blah blah

2570
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,960
you should have done should have done

2571
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:33,119
that and I was like wait that was a good

2572
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,880
idea I should have done that but now

2573
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:37,119
that I said it out loud and they think

2574
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,960
like oh like I wouldn't do it I think

2575
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:40,920
now it would be more believable

2576
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,840
especially with this one cuz all the

2577
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:44,199
other ones like like the $2 ones and

2578
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:46,880
everything came in the size but this is

2579
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:49,239
a $5 one and it's literally a checked

2580
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:51,040
the exact same size as the other one and

2581
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:53,560
I said that I I was not going to get a

2582
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:56,719
fake ticket yes yesterday and I

2583
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:59,159
overnighted this and it came today so I

2584
01:53:56,719 --> 01:54:02,599
think that this could fool them so I'm

2585
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:04,000
going to do my best attempt this is a $5

2586
01:54:02,599 --> 01:54:11,480
ticket and it's going to

2587
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:13,840
show that we won $100,000 so 7 30 11 and

2588
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:15,520
9 I like this one it's very simple we

2589
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:17,040
should keep this

2590
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:19,360
one

2591
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:22,639

2943
02:10:35,159 --> 02:10:40,520
the little basic tricks first so I think

2944
02:10:37,719 --> 02:10:43,760
you try to go like

2945
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:46,040
this all right just make sure you don't

2946
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:48,520
hit your eye right here okay so show you

2947
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:51,440
just like this you're going just toss it

2948
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:53,000
and just let oh my God all right

2949
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:56,480
don't drop in the floor cuz we going use

2950
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:58,280
this to eat oh God okay yeah a tiny and

2951
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:00,880
then it's going to flip and

2952
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:03,520
then I'm going to do it like play bypl

2953
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:05,679
here like Red Zone like that and then

2954
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:08,440
it's going to spin yeah but don't do it

2955
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,040
too hard cuz it will either go that way

2956
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:11,599
right in the middle or right towards you

2957
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:13,760
I'll do it gentle yeah so have it like

2958
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:15,440
this the goal and like a gentle is it

2959
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:18,199
better if it falls on the stove like on

2960
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:19,760
the on the make sure you don't grab it

2961
02:11:18,199 --> 02:11:21,800
I'll grab it if it falls on the stove

2962
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:23,880
got don't burn yourself

2963
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:26,520
