[ __ ] watermelon salt them off

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,260
okay cheers Chris I want to rub them

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,260
together

66
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,440
it just tastes like watermelon but far

67
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,800
less enjoyable it like takes the juicy

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,800
out of it

69
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,959
I hate it

70
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,819
oh my God it's really bad it just takes

71
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,580
the juicy out of the water oh my God

72
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,560
it's awful I'm like shocked at how bad

73
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,560
it is I'm like eating I'm like eating

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,540
the side without the salt

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,840
it's really bad it almost like it's like

76
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,060
a weird chemical reaction

77
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,260
it's so it doesn't taste like sauce I

78
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,239
think I might have put too much salt

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,159
that one's a series maybe a heart attack

80
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,760
no that one's a zero

81
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:54,599
oh that one's a zero oh my God that was

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,819
bad next next all right next is popcorn

83
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,500

know

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,799
that's probably the most Tabasco sauce

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,599
that's ever been in one bowl at a time

92
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,359

okay

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,440

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,440
I ever remember

104
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,380
probably one of the worst I just don't

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,780
like it because it's wet like it gets

106
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,460

it's supposed to dip it in

202
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,380

203
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,220
eating a pickle and they slipped and

204
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,220

maybe it's not that bad because the

212
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,980
Pickle's so I think we need a big dip
