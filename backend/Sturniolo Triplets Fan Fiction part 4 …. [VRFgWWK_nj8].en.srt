2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,880
filming fan fiction today okay we took

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,859
the pressure off of you man I know you

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,300
really enjoy picking them but we figured

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,760
you'd already read them all so we were

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,660

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,660
feared Chris

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,340
but it's okay

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,059
and I had to also have to download the

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,680
app I didn't have it on my phone already

11
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:40,079
but I downloaded that yeah I got logged

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,879
out anyway okay closer to the name of

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,660
the fan fiction wins

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,100

140
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,600
to reality yarn I mentioned 977 because

141
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,240
I am so confused where you pull this

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,639
[ __ ] I don't get where people writing

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,680
fan fictions like you can't copy a story

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,400
that exists you can't be even remotely

145
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,039
creative like that was really bad but

146
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,800
twin siblings I don't get like there's

147
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,380
no world in which twins are like okay

148
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,139
with being in a constant love triangle

149
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,539
friendship

150
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:06,840
I wonder what people like

151
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:08,580
think like happens with like you and me

152
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,900
I don't really get it I really I don't

153
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,940
either

154
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,500
guys I'm gonna tell you a story Ramona

155
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,380
says to the camera the triplets all

156
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,020
grown and roll their eyes as we shut

157
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,759
honestly this girl should stop talking

158
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,340
but don't stop Ramona from continuing

159
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,319
her story oh it doesn't stop her good

160
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,600
she's persistent

161
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,919
she has to be dude like that because

162
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,900
everyone's gonna be shooting down ideas

163
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,060
left and right

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,860
so in eighth grade math Chris and Nick

165
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,960
this other guy named Lucas we're all in

166
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,380
a big friend group well and me of course

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,240
because I'm better but whatever so

168
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,460
so Chris and Lucas were like really good

169
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,440
friends and they like they were like the

170
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,300
best friends of the group I guess and

171
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,800
they both liked me but I liked maths

172
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,300
like it was a whole thing because Matt

173
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,919
kind of liked my best friend and she

174
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,419
liked him back and yeah it was a huge

175
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,220
thing because like my best friend at the

176
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,660
time got really upset whenever me and

177
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,060
Matt were close and it started to hold

178
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,639
them so everybody likes Ramona now

179
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,500
apparently but what was the big prize

180
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,180
she's the big cookie she's dead she's

181
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,460
been [ __ ] we're over it now and I

182
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,380
learned to never be close friends with

183
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,139
your best friend's crushes and yeah

184
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,120
that's my story Ramona shares oh my God

185
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,660
I totally forgot about all that drama

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,160
bro Liz was such in eighth grade like

187
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,599
I'm sorry I know she was your best

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,039
friend but like she really ruined every

189
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,199
friendship you had

190
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,360
like she was such a bad friend Nick

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,759
States I honestly think Ramona is the

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,800
problem so it's crazy that they paint my

193
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,500
picture to be her best friend I can't

194
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,660
stand her I think who's who's it Liz I

195
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,819
think Liz was probably completely in the

196
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,280
right unfortunately for unfortunately

197
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:44,039
for Ramona and the story she's trying to

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
tell like this is the most fiction fan

199
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,599
fiction I've ever read in my life to be

200
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,979
quite honest because this is just

201
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,599
unrealistic after unrealistic after

202
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,020
unrealistic I feel like I'm in a dream

203
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,780
like this is unrealistic written in a

204
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,599
realistic way it was fan fiction no what

205
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,699
I mean is like it's it's realistic just

206
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,460
like it's unrealistic to us but it's

207
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,400
like a realistic thing like but in my

208
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,319
head in my head it's so unrealistic she

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,419
could be like a dragon and wizard pull

210
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
up in the room and cast a magic spell on

211
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,960
everyone and that would be the least

212
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,960
bizarre thing if I'm being quite honest

213
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,360
she could say bragging comes in and eats

214
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,500
her dog and I'd be like oh okay that

215
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,599
makes a whole lot more sense than

216
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,460
whatever the he's already on this paper

217
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,300
because right now I'm just reading a

218
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,520
bunch of [ __ ] like over and over hello

219
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,539
okay I'm done we can go pick up Ivory

220
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,159
now

221
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,620
I hate the name Ivory because I just

222
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,599
think of rhinos

223
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,599
what it's not what dragons have

224
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,580
I feel like you're right but I don't

225
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,620
know how like I've heard that but I

226
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,660
don't know like isn't they poached

227
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,640
rhinos for ifrey like that's the magic

228
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,040
maybe in there that's what I'm talking

229
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,480
about Okay Google it hold on I don't

230
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,519

231
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,680
up Ivory Now Matt says okay antsy pants

232
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,860
Ramona replies shut up you probably want

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,260
to see her more than all of us combined

234
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,260
so I don't got Shame about that she

235
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,820
states whatever let's go okay I'm done

236
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,060

poached them for the horns because

242
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,180

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,539
unreal the unrealistic Parts make me

547
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,400
laugh and I stand by what I said like I

548
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,260
could literally a leprechaun could show

549
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,900
up and give everyone fairy magic and I

550
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,539
believe in more than half these stories

551
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,620
it's just her in her story

552
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,840
or so YouTube like they're so like

553
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,880
um like we're gonna go film a baking

554
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,039
video in a car video in the parking lot

555
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,740
which we filmed in the minivan with my

556
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,059
triplet Brothers

557
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,760
like this I'm sorry I just don't gag

558
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,200

559
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,860

560
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,080

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,539
involved and it's like weird as [ __ ]

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,520

567
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,039
rewarding this type of behavior I think

568
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,840
it's awesome

569
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,260
