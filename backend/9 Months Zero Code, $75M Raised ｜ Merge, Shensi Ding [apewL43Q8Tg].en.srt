1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,800
a lot of people think that if you come

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,279
up with a really good idea that's all

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,319
you need but you need to understand isra

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,880
competition who has done this before

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,599
have they been successful if not why not

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,880
why would you be more successful than

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
other people you really need to deeply

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,800
understand why you will be better than

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,680
them and how you will be better than

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,279
them and you don't understand why you're

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,880
building when you're building it you

12
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,240
can't be successful hi everyone I'm

[Music]

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
Berlin oh my gosh trying to get your

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,079
first customers is so painful we spent a

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,559
long time building in stealth before we

26
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,519
started fundraising we were starting to

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
build a product and then once we

28
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,320
fundraised we continued building the

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,400
product and we actually didn't launch

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,720
for a year or so and once you come out

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,360
of steth you just expect all the

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,920
customers to come and they don't so we

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,200
were basically outbound begging people

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,560
to take a chance on us and to try our

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
product out and those early customer

36
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,119
sales processes taught me a lot about

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,280
what questions people would ask and I

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,640
think one thing that Gil and I did

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,560
really well was we really packed our

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
calendars with as many sales calls as

41
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,240
possible so we were pretty much like

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,439
from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. both of us

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,439
just on calls it was a really tough

44
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,920
period in our life um we were just in

45
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,520
phone booths all day on calls and back

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,479
to back to back but it's it was a really

47
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,759
great muscle for just hearing the same

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,520
call over and over again AB testing

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,320
different pitches and seeing how people

50
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,600
reacted also just seeing the wide

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,399
variety of questions that people might

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
ask so by the time we hired our first

53
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,840
salesperson we were able to teach him

54
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,520
the answers to the questions that we

55
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,719
knew were always going to get asked if

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,640
we hadn't done that I think it would

57
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,640
have been really hard for us to ramp our

58
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,840
first salesperson we wouldn't know what

59
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,520
questions would come we wouldn't know

60
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,039
how to answer them and so by the time he

61
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,280
came we were able to say hey this is the

62
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,640
way that customers really like this is

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,280
what really resonates with them this is

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
what you shouldn't say so I think it was

65
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,360
really helpful for me and Gil to just

66
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,039
get those first reps in because it made

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,679
it so that the first salesperson that

68
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,440
came in and head of sales he was really

69
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,440
prepped and he was he was set up for

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,920
success to be honest we found product

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,280
Market fit pretty early on I think the

72
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,879
process of finding product Market fit

73
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,640
actually mostly happened before we even

74
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,920
started the companies user interviews

75
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,360
getting validation from people and how

76
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,080
much they would spend money all the

77
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,040
research had really happened before we

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
even started building I just didn't want

79
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,640
us to start building the product and

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,879
figuring it out later I wanted us to do

81
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,360
the research up front and we probably

82
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,519
spent six to nine months of just doing

83
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
user research before we quit our jobs a

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,480
lot of people think that if you come up

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
with a really good idea that's all you

86
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,840
need but you need to understand isra

87
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,360
competition who has done this before

88
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,080
have they been successful if not why not

89
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,280
why would you be more successful than

90
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,840
other people also the chances of you

91
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
thinking of an idea that no one else has

92
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,080
thought of before is extremely unlikely

93
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
probably someone else has tried this

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
before and they probably haven't

95
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
unsuccess successful if you haven't

96
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,239
heard of them or they're maybe in the

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
early parts of the journey so you really

98
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,760
need to deeply understand why you will

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,920
be better than them and how you will be

100
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,720
better than them so we started every

101
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,760
week and we would spend a day together

102
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
just reading up on the industry trying

103
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,840
to better understand it trying to better

104
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,400
understand why companies out there that

105
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,640
were weren't solving this problem and if

106
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,400
they were trying to why it wasn't quite

107
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,000
the right solution so I think the

108
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
research is so so so important because

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,080
if you're not opinionated about it and

110
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,920
you don't understand why you're building

111
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,760
when you're building it you can't be

112
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,760
successful

113
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,879
I think a consistent characteristic of

114
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
billion dollar companies is successfully

115
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,159
operating at scale with each team

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
operating on its own so what that means

117
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,760
is that each manager is successful at

118
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,360
operating their team and the manager

119
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,840
about that as well there's no individual

120
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,519
that needs to contribute a ton in order

121
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,720
to make the company successful the teams

122
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,640
are just operating at skill on their own

123
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,959
and that's really hard to achieve

124
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,400
especially from an earlier stage where

125
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,280
each individual is the one that's

126
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
contributing a lot to the company so I

127
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,079
think that transformation from

128
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,000
individuals contributing a lot to the

129
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,840
company to each team operating

130
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,519
autonomously and operating on their own

131
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,959
cross functionally that's the goal but

132
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,959
it's hard to

133
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,479
do it's not always natural for friends

134
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,360
to turn into co-founders and you really

135
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,280
have to have a foundation of trust you

136
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,280
also have to have complimentary Skillet

137
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,160
my co-founder is a genius he is the best

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
software engineer I know even to this

139
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,560
day Gil and I knew each other from

140
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,960
freshman year of college we met in

141
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,320
orientation and then we were in all the

142
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
same computer science class that's at

143
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,680
Columbia and so we knew each other

144
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,520
pretty well socially but we were also

145
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,800
fortunate enough to be on engineering

146
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,680
student council together in college and

147
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,320
that actually became a pretty helpful

148
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,600
proxy for what it would be like to work

149
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
together we were class president and

150
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
vice president our senior year and after

151
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,720
school we kept in contact and Gil and I

152
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,720
naturally just living our parallel lives

153
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,960
ended up getting skill sets that really

154
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,000
worked well together I'm kind of like a

155
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,039
master of none and I just I know a lot

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,520
of things I can code I can sell do

157
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,000
Financial forecasting but Gil is like

158
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,240
the best software engineer ever and he's

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
a great people leader and I felt like

160
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,160
the combination of the two would

161
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,000
actually be a really great pair the

162
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,000
advantages are it's just really fun

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
everyone that we've hired is so great we

164
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,199
have such a good time at work and a part

165
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,520
of that is because Gil and I are good

166
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,360
friends like we just really wanted to

167
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,319
make sure like the environment around us

168
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,680
replicated how much fun we had together

169
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,880
and it seems like so far we've been able

170
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,000
to scale that which is great

171
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,120
disadvantages are that your friendship

172
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,360
does change forever it's great because

173
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,680
it's more textured and it's deeper but

174
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,080
you probably don't want to hang out on

175
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
the weekends all the time together

176
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,160
because you're always together the

177
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
weekday you just end up like having a

178
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,360
friendship that's mostly just like okay

179
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
it's much more like you want to just

180
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
hang out you want to have a good time

181
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,280
but then now it's almost like you have

182
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
like a kid together and you always are

183
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
caring about this kid and you want to

184
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
talk about this kid together and that's

185
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,479
the company and a disadvantage of that

186
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,479
is just like your friendship completely

187
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,280
changes one thing that has helped a lot

188
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,120
with the really hard parts of being a

189
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,080
Founder is just making friends who are

190
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,440
peers I have a really great group of

191
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,599
female founder friends in New York City

192
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,240
that I made after I started merge and we

193
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,520
just talk about everything like

194
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,680
everything bad especially and it's

195
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,759
really hard to break that barrier with a

196
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,720
lot of Founders because people just

197
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,000
don't want to share that kind of

198
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,960
information it's very very sensitive

199
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,120
like you don't want to share your

200
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
numbers you don't want to share like

201
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,599
things that are going badly you don't

202
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
want to share about people who hate you

203
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,560
you don't want to share about customers

204
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,599
that hate you but like having people

205
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,400
that you can talk about that with really

206
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,400
makes it easier because everyone's going

207
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,080
through the same thing and everyone

208
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,440
hates their lives and I think just once

209
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,720
you realize that every founder journey

210
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,800
is really painful and that no one has it

211
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,440
easy it just makes it a lot it makes it

212
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,560
a lot better I think one thing that I've

213
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,400
learned is as I'm living through life

214
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm not really grateful for the time

215
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,639
that I'm currently in but then as time

216
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,160
passes and I'm in the following year I

217
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,160
look back and I'm like wow that was such

218
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,720
a great time period and that actually

219
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,919
has consistently happened every year now

220
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,199
and so now I've realized like I'm

221
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,319
currently living in a time that I will

222
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,840
like look very fondly on in the future

223
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
and at some point like this journey with

224
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,680
merge will end and I'll be really really

225
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
sad about it so I think right now I'm

226
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,039
just really trying to like appreciate

227
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,039
every single day as much as possible

228
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:26,149
