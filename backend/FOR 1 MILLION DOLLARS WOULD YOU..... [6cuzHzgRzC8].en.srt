255
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,000
the way up there like I look at the Moon

256
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,120

259
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,800
whole another like place but it

260
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,959
obviously is that's the whole point of

261
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,480
the Moon never talk to each other again

262
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,519
no way more than a

263
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,880

363

big foot like he's big he's not small

364
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,199

365
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,360
want me to slap her for a million bucks

366
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:36,320

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
chocolate

374
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,199
pudding dude I feel like there the

375
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
consistency isn't there my God it's like

376
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,800
jello from um cloud with the chance of

377
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,440
meall I drown I drown dead that's

378
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,519
actually a really big fear of mine what

379
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,160
jell no imagine being like just enclosed

380
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
and like Jello-O and you can't get out

381
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,839
so yes Jell-O not Jello-O itself being

382
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,360
trapped in it I don't think you got to

383
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,079
worry about for YouTube video we should

384
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,880
make as much Jello-O as we can and fill

385
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,440
up like a kitty pool even bigger than

386
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,279
that I'm thinking big we should make

387
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,759
like a we should get a pool like an

388
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,519
above ground pool sorry I need it it you

389
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,160
don't need it there's nothing around me

390
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,560
that I can touch I feel so like whatever

391
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,360
you don't need it there's not much room

392
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,720
for me back here I don't care I

393
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,720
scratching

394
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:40,199
my I don't even have shoes on or

395
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,360
anything that's fine that's your fault

396
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,399
we should get an above ground pool and

397
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,440
buy tons of Jello-O mix and then just

398
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,639
make Jello but at like a way bigger

399
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,560
scale like huge Jello that would take

400
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,600
forever I don't have that time

401
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,600
commitment to make big jello decorate

402
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,839
the

403
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,040
house no no that's where I draw the line

404
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,279
no I can't decorate the house for a

405
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,319
million bucks no way what does like what

406
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,920
does that even mean I don't [ __ ] know

407
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,759
dude sick for a whole year ew no I think

408
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,199
being sick is my least favorite feeling

409
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,360
in the world it's so gross last time I

410
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,160
got Co I literally thought I was going

411
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,319
to die I know I remember you know what

412
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,199
Scooby-Doo's mom's name

413
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:27,560
is Ruby dooo that's a good one it sounds

414
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,519
like EMB barking Ruby dooo and it's her

415
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,800
name like scoobydoo rub Doo he can't

416
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,720
pronounce his S as well anyways let a

417
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,279
lion chase you for a million dollars no

418
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,040
I die dead do we not understand this

419
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,240
anything that ends my life I wouldn't do

420
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,199
for a million dollar cuz a million

421
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,040
dollars would vanish Into Thin Air and

422
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,360
become nothing I

423
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,839
agree think about it I thought about it

424
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,399
guys we're going to eat

425
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,120
Barnacles Barnacles Barnacles lowkey

426
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,560
like good scratched your throat no not

427
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,920
like Barnacles but like there's actually

428
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,560
like Barnacle Bills They don't serve

429
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,279
barnacle no I feel like it's got to be

430
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,280
good like it's just Seafood it's got if

431
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,120
you could cook up a barnacle I feel like

432
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,640
like the inside's a worm is it not I

433
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,919
don't know for a million dollars they

434
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,839
wouldn't be able to put fire on all

435
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,600
their books they wouldn't be able to

436
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,079
light their books on fire just can I

437
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,640
tell you what books are paper words

438
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,880
literal the definition of Fire Starter

439
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
if I'm in the woods and I have a book

440
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm lighting that [ __ ] on fire you me

441
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,559
papers fire starter not words you said

442
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,960
words it's words it's just words words

443
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,360
on paper I had to light a book on fire

444
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,440
in 35 seconds hold and burn it hold on

445
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,039
the way that I think about it is you

446
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,000
don't have a million dollar worth of

447
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,640
books so like them all and on fire buy

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,320
the books again and then you have some

449
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,039
profit left I trying to say m but you

450
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,000
just said it with no energy like a baby

451
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,640
like Matt talks like this and then

452
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,480
expects people to be entertained he'll

453
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
make a joke that I make loudly like this

454
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
and it's like what do you want them to

455
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,240
hear they can barely hear you is not

456
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,799
[Music]

457
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,960
funny not be able to shower or bathe for

458
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,679
a year I wouldn't be able to do it I

459
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,000
need to shower I need to shower right

460
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,280
now actually actually really need to

461
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,640
shower like the thought of not being

462
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,280
able to stay a year is some things like

463
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,919
in real life that just seem so cartoon

464
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,039
that would happen Nick manorisms like

465
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,480
