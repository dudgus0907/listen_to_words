1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,319
every time your company doubles in

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,800
headcount size it breaks especially

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:11,000
within the tech and the startup

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,240
landscape we're all attracted to Big

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,840
names and big dollar signs and big

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,439
markets but focusing on a core product

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,560
and a core user in a core use case I

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,400
believe that that breeds excellence in a

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,119
product the riches are in the niches and

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,720
that's a difficult thing to do it

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,960
requires a lot of discipline and this is

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,359
a secret that I would recommend to

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
everyone I'm Alex Beller one of the

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,040
co-founders of postcript postcript is an

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,960
SMS marketing platform for e-commerce

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,320
businesses and the idea from the start

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,320
was SMS marketing for Brands built on

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
top of Shopify make a really easy really

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
powerful solution that lets people

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,360
retarget transact converse with their

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,440
customers over text message postcript

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,039
found product Market fit very early

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,359
customers wanted to send text messages

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,519
to their and subscribers to their

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,359
Shoppers and as long as it generates

26
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,960
clear Roi they're going to want to send

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
more and around this time we decided to

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,680
apply to Y combinator and we did that

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
for many reasons uh we were kind of

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Outsiders we were based in LA in Arizona

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
we weren't very connected to the tech

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,640
scene and I went into our application

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,119
after we filed it every few days and I

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,240
would update it with our new Revenue

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,000
number so that when they logged into our

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
application to review it they would see

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
on this date this was their revenue on

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
this date the revenue was higher on this

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
day the revenue was higher and this was

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,799
like our second or third month and that

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
was the time when our Revenue each week

42
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,680
was was going from like $200 a month to$

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,119
800 to 2,000 to 3,000 I believe that the

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,439
reason that we got in to YC was because

45
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,840
they saw this growth trajectory and all

46
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,560
that growth was coming from word of

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,880
mouth and it was coming from the Shopify

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,360
App Store it was all inbound to us we

49
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,600
were in the right time at the right

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,119
place with the right product that

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,479
generated value for our users and by the

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
time we left YC combinator we were past

53
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,479
a million in annual revenue

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,159
approximately 6 to 7 months after we

55
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,719
launched we've raised several rounds of

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,200
funding since then then through series C

57
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,719
we bought a company called fondue and we

58
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,399
are now about 270 or 280 people spread

59
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,399
out across the

60
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,480
US you know we were talking about

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,239
different startup ideas me and Adam our

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
third partner Colin they started

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,080
building what became postcript our early

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,680
customers were amazing they're very

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,680
funny they were small e-commerce

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,440
entrepreneurs so a couple of things

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,840
worked for us really well in early days

68
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,000
we did something that in hindsight we

69
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,720
like hadn't put much thought into but

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
ended up being a really good idea and

71
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,000
this is a secret that I would recommend

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,560
to everyone we put a live chat widget on

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,480
our website and inside the postcript

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,599
application and we set it up so that

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,319
whenever anyone chatted in whenever any

76
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,400
User submitted a chat it would call all

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,120
three of our cell phones NE and Adam

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
calling it would ring us and we would

79
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,200
immediately stop whatever we were doing

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
and we would like to we would drop it

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
and we would go log in Andy try to help

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,319
that person we would answer their

83
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,760
questions we would take feedback from

84
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,120
them we would help them use the product

85
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,200
whatever that turned out to be an

86
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,040
incredible secret that accelerated us so

87
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,200
much and there's a bunch of reasons why

88
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,920
first we learned so much from these

89
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,040
early customers I mean they were giving

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,879
us feedback on holes in our product and

91
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,159
and what we needed to build next and

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,400
pricing they're giving us feedback on

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,000
everything and so then we could just

94
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,239
build exactly what they were asking for

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,720
and they'd be happier but the other

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,920
thing that came out of it is people were

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,599
getting great amazing Hands-On support

98
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,239
from the founders and we would be super

99
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,159
open that we were the founders of this

100
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,680
tiny little business and people really

101
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,920
like that and so they started to tell

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
their friends or other people they knew

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,040
about the post trip product they started

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,439
leaving us good reviews on the Shopify

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,720
App Store that then had our application

106
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,480
listing rank even higher there and so us

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,360
just talking to our customers as much as

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,120
possible and being super available I

109
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,400
mean we would wake up in the middle of

110
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,079
the night when our cell phone rang to

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,959
help customers we would leave leave the

112
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,560
ringer on and that created a lot of our

113
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,720
ground swell that led to our early

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,840
growth and so our first 100 users a lot

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,239
of it came from being hyper available

116
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,560
from being public but listening to our

117
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,199
customers talking to them and just

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
providing completely over-the-top

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
support it's actually a lot of what Paul

120
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,720
Graham talks about when he says do

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
things that don't scale you know now

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,199
posted his 18,000 customers I cannot do

123
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,639
the chat support for all of them anymore

124
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,039
but doing that for so long we spent

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,440
months and months and months we were the

126
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,280
only ones who did support for postcript

127
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,240
and we did it all the time live that we

128
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,880
learned so much the product advance so

129
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,759
much and and we got to spread a lot of

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Word of Mouth came from that

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,000
too so uh we launched really with an MVP

132
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,320
that directly grew into postcript we've

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,880
enhanced it and we've expanded it but we

134
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,680
never pivoted it was SMS marketing for

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,360
e-commerce on Shopify and that's still

136
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,440
what it is today in early days of

137
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,400
postcript we had had Brands come to us

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,199
big brands that heard about us that

139
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,360
weren't on Shopify and they wanted to

140
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,720
give us a lot of money to send text

141
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,759
messages right so they're an e-commerce

142
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
brand that's SAR sweet spot they want to

143
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,000
use postcript for exactly what everyone

144
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,280
else uses it for but they had a

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
different underlying technology they

146
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,840
weren't on Shopify they were using a

147
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
different

148
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,680
platform I'm the revenue leader of the

149
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,160
company that's a hard thing to say no to

150
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,000
right that's hard to walk away from a

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,840
huge prominent brand who wants to pay us

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,360
a lot of money and be our friend and do

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,000
a case study with us but we decided to

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
pass on that and we said you know what

155
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,960
we'll we'll see you later on down the

156
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,479
road but right now we're focused on this

157
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,600
one thing and that's a difficult thing

158
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,240
to do it requires a lot of discipline

159
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,680
but it would have taken us off track it

160
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,120
would have led to distraction we would

161
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,120
have been building in many different

162
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,199
directions then with limited resources

163
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,800
and it would have been a mistake because

164
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,120
of that Focus so much of our value has

165
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
been created and so yes we've considered

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,360
expansion many times we've considered

167
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,680
expanding markets we've considered

168
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,319
expanding use cases outside of SMS but

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
what we keep coming back to is that

170
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,840
there remains more opportunity in this

171
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,639
core space and no one has really solved

172
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,479
it yet we think we're doing an excellent

173
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,039
job but there's still so much more to BU

174
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,720
build and so much more value to deliver

175
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,160
to these customers we want to do that

176
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,479
first we like to be the one that goes

177
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,120
deeper I think there's many traps and

178
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,960
many mistakes that all of us fall into

179
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,160
in the early days myself and and US

180
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,160
included but focus is one that is

181
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,919
underrated especially within the tech

182
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,800
and the startup landscape we're all

183
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,960
attracted to Big names and big dollar

184
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,080
signs and big markets but focusing on a

185
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,680
core product and a core user in a core

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,000
use case to start not forever but to

187
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,400
start I believe that that breeds

188
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,879
excellence in a product the riches are

189
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,720
in the niches I I really believe and

190
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,319
that's paid off for us where we've been

191
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,400
so laser focused on E Commerce marketers

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,360
that use Shopify and delivering them an

193
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,840
amazing SMS experience and that's really

194
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,800
paid off for us and I think that anyone

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,560
who uses postcript or works with the

196
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,919
postcript team experiences that craft

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,599
because they can tell that there's so

198
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,960
much expertise there what makes great

199
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,840
CEOs and great leaders is the ability to

200
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,639
look at your resourcing look at your

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,240
organization look at the all the

202
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,520
opportunities in front of you and

203
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,199
sequence things properly so that as much

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,199
lines up as possible

205
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,400
so there's a common framing that I hear

206
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,440
from a lot of other late stage Founders

207
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,960
or investors that I believe is true

208
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,560
which is that every time your company

209
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,840
doubles in headcount size it breaks and

210
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,000
I've really seen that to be the case you

211
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,199
know when it's 10 people everyone's

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,280
connected to everyone and it's all

213
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,400
automatic and then suddenly it's 25

214
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,159
people and you need management layers of

215
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,039
some kind and then it's 50 and it's a

216
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,800
completely different company and 100 and

217
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,560
200 they're totally different companies

218
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,039
and they require different styles of

219
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,159
communication and man agement and they

220
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,240
require a lot of different things from

221
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,800
their Founders when you advance to the

222
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,840
growth stage the people challeng is

223
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,720
really set in your organization becomes

224
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,120
so much more about how you can direct

225
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,759
the resources at your disposal instead

226
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,199
of how can you as a Craftsman or a

227
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,720
practitioner build product or work with

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
customers and those are very different

229
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,159
skill sets when I think about some of

230
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,720
the biggest lessons or tips that I could

231
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,159
give entrepreneurs thinking about

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,120
scaling uh what comes to mind more than

233
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,120
anything else is values when we started

234
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
the business we didn't create a set of

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,839
values and the reason for this was

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,240
because we'd all worked in companies

237
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,399
before that you know had values but

238
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,160
maybe they weren't that important or you

239
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,720
know they just they hung on the wall but

240
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,279
no one really knew them or was connected

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,200
to them and so we just thought it was

242
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,040
Superfluous but Tim Brady who was one of

243
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,920
our partners at y combinator when we

244
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,399
were about to hire our first team member

245
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,959
he said to us create a couple values

246
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,959
it'll help you anchor the culture in

247
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,519
something and that's what we did the

248
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,880
three of us sat down and we banged our

249
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,240
head against the wall and we got the

250
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,399
Whiteboard out and we created a set of

251
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,480
values that value set has been core to

252
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,440
the culture that has been built a

253
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,120
postcript for now almost 7 years the key

254
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,839
tip that I would give people is not just

255
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,760
to create a set of values but to make

256
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,959
sure it has a great acronym this is

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,240
actually the hack because what's more

258
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,839
important than what the values are it's

259
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,519
that everyone knows them like the

260
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,880
specific things I'm sure everyone can

261
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,279
pick inspirational good values but

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,399
what's more important is just that

263
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,200
everyone can remember them and that they

264
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,240
uh reflect how you believe work should

265
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:55,360
occur so to get specific the values at

266
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,640
postcript the acronym for them is Fe Fe

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,120
it's kind of a funny word it's f a c h

268
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,279
it's Fearless

269
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,480
Excellence animal customer first

270
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,240
humility every time a new person joins

271
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,519
postcript they go through a training

272
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
with me where I walk them through all of

273
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,440
our values what Fe stands for the story

274
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,720
behind each one how we believe it should

275
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
show up at work and then people get

276
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,120
recognized for living these values and

277
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
it comes up in their annual reviews and

278
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
we have a slack Channel going where

279
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,760
people get shouted out for living within

280
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,120
these values and that has really helped

281
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,040
guide our culture and keep us all

282
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,320
together as we've grown remotely but I

283
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
believe that the values that are going

284
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,440
to be relevant to an organization are

285
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,920
going to change over time they're not

286
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,920
always the same I'll give you an example

287
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,320
the e in Fe of our company's values

288
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,560
today it stands for excellence it didn't

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,240
always stand for that it used to stand

290
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,639
for 8020 8020 meaning we wanted people

291
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,959
to be operating from an 8020 mindset we

292
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,920
didn't want folks to focus on Perfection

293
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,480
we wanted to be moving really quickly we

294
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,639
wanted to be doing whatever we could to

295
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,880
capture as much value as we can with 20%

296
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,399
of the effort and then move on to the

297
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,959
next thing and that was great that

298
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,120
helped us move quickly and that helped

299
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,120
us inform how we built product and that

300
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,079
helped us inform how we built process

301
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,519
and that was an amazing early stage

302
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,399
value I mean I would recommend it to

303
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,680
many folks but after a while we realized

304
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,200
we were running into issues because of

305
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,440
it we were well past 100 people and we

306
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,800
needed more robust processes and systems

307
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,399
we needed our product to be sturdier and

308
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,639
more stable right and less about just

309
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,079
shipping everything that's new and

310
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,560
making sure what we had was really

311
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,680
robust as we were serving bigger and

312
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,680
bigger customers and at that point we

313
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,560
went in and we changed the value from

314
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,680
8020 which starts with an E to

315
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,120
Excellence which also starts with an E

316
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,320
and that way the acronym for our value

317
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,600
stayed the same but we got to change the

318
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,000
DNA of the company and we haven't done

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
that many times it's probably happened

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,360
three times but each time it's been

321
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,560
really valuable and it's kind of a weird

322
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,240
quirky little learned secret but I would

323
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,160
really recommend other entrepreneurs as

324
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,240
they as they're scaling think about

325
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,880
doing something similar be comfortable

326
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,040
going back and changing your company

327
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,440
values sometimes it's incumbent on a

328
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,639
Founder to reset something and to make

329
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,120
it clear that you know I'm hearing all

330
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,600
this feedback but actually I disagree

331
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,839
and we're going in this direction here

332
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,839
and values are a great way to do

333
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,600
it about what's going on with AI today

334
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,560
with generative Ai and when I think

335
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,839
about what's going on uh what's been

336
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,399
going on for a long time with predictive

337
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,920
machine learning what I see is a future

338
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,279
where on to many marketing goes away and

339
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,440
where it becomes highly personalized and

340
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,760
in the SMS space highly conversational

341
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,399
since the beginning of the e-commerce

342
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,320
use case marketing has been generally

343
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
one way it's I'm an e-commerce marketer

344
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I am pushing out a notification to my

345
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,519
audience to try to get them to go by

346
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,560
that works it's fine but that's not how

347
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,040
we actually use messaging we all text

348
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,160
one another back and forth in

349
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
conversations and at postcript we've

350
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,880
always believed that there is an

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,360
enormous opportunity for Brands to see

352
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
even higher performance and for

353
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,680
consumers to be even happier if the

354
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,480
interactions are conversational between

355
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,079
them first more of a push marketing

356
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,360
Approach at postcript we've been

357
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,320
invested in this for a while we built

358
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,959
and launched a product called SMS sales

359
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,800
it is the only part of our company that

360
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,440
is in person and we have a huge office

361
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,880
in Phoenix Arizona that is filled with

362
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,480
e-commerce salespeople who work on

363
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,120
behalf of our Brands to sell and drive

364
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,160
more trans actions over the SMS channel

365
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,120
it's kind of old school it's like if you

366
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,079
walk into a retail store and someone

367
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,399
helps you shop or buy or answers your

368
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,519
questions it's like that for e-commerce

369
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,040
and we've been doing this for several

370
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,519
years and we built up an enormous amount

371
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,600
of expertise in it and many of our

372
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,440
largest customers many huge brands are

373
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,279
using it to drive more sales and to keep

374
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,680
their customers happy and we are so

375
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,160
excited at the opportunity of bringing

376
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,519
that to further scale with new

377
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,720
advancements in Ai and the data sets

378
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,120
that we've been building and the

379
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,240
conversational training that we've been

380
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,920
doing over the last several years uh we

381
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,399
believe puts us in a unique position to

382
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,839
capitalize on that Trend Ai and

383
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,160
predictive machine learning together are

384
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,959
not only going to unlock the

385
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,519
personalization I was just talking about

386
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,519
but they're also going to allow for a

387
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
much more conversational marketing

388
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,279
experience that phrase conversational

389
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
Commerce has been like floating in The

390
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
Ether forever and no one's really done

391
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,680
it and I believe now it's actually going

392
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,680
to happen
