burping whatever you just

208
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,720
did that was so rude for context I'm 6

209
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,080
feet tall and my brother and I are only

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
15 months fls right away though we are

211
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,039
close in age my brother is still

212
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,360
significantly shorter and smaller than I

213
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,199
am which is often something I forget one

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
time we were joke fighting and he

215
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,639
accidentally scratched and jammed my

216
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,479
nose into my face which obvious viously

217
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,280
made my whole face jolt in my eyes water

218
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,000
and it legit filled me with so much

219
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,159
anger and rage I full on five starred

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,039
him in the back and no joke the slap

221
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,680
echoed through my house and it sounded

222
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,400
like a gunshot or something similar I

223
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,039
don't think it matters that much because

224
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
he hit you first he hit you first you

225
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,960
guys are also siblings siblings are

226
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,120
going to have moments correct he hit you

227
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,240
first but also like I don't think the 64

228
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,879
thing the six foot thing was necessary

229
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,039
at all I agree I think she just wanted

230
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,479
to tell us that she was tall 64 and he's

231
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,120
shorter than me which I often forget

232
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,240
what you what do you remember when you

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,680
walk next to this is her nice thing is

234
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,200
nice but Nick's going to freak out

235
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,959
Nick's going to actually freak out

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
unplug those ears big boy I recently got

237
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,360

retaliated which like okay you shouldn't

248
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
have hit him back but it's okay he

249
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,040

outside their house at the same time

345
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,160
they were doing this I was taking my dog

346
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,839
out my neighbor then asked me to put the

347
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,639
ladder away while he was on his roof

348
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,959
roof so I didn't question anything and I

349
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,360
put the ladder on the side of their

350
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,639
house and went back inside I went back

351
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,680
outside 2 hours later to take my dog out

352
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
again but ended up also seeing my

353
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,079
neighbor stranded on his roof he didn't

354
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,440
tell me to put away the ladder he told

355
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,880
me to get away from the ladder because

356
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,320
he didn't want me to bump into it or my

357
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,800
dog to bump into it I couldn't fully

358
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,720
hear him when he was on the roof because

359
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,920

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,159
got in trouble for no reason there's

518
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,640
definitely a [ __ ] reason actually

519
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,840
psychotic

520
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,240

521
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,039
good person but the naughtiest thing I

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,640
did this year is absolutely diabolical

523
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,240
and I wish I could go back and change

524
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,159
this but my dad was having an affair

525
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,000

to know this is for fun I found some

530
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,960
holes in them and H put jalapeno sauce

534
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,120
to see if he would you know this is fake

535
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,480

542
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,080
from behind and I felt so guilty but I

543
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,120
didn't see him he kept apologizing and I

544
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,159
kept telling him I'm sorry and said it

545
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,600
was okay then he proceeded to walk into

546
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,320

547
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,720
