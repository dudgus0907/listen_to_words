00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,790
Next up is a brand with a mission to

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:16,400
inspire cultural pride.

[Music]

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,720
Hi, my name is Sam Hyan. And I'm Adam

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
King. And we're two unapologetic

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,560
Asian-Americans from Boston. We're

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,760
seeking $100,000 for a

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,320
15.87% stake in our revolutionary

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
sneaker brand. Sharks. Did you know that

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,079
Asian-Americans are obsessed with

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,440
sneakers and are a huge factor in

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,120
driving sneaker culture and a

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,520
significant percentage of all sneaker

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,680
sales? I'm one of those guys. I live,

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
breathe, and sleep sneakers. I even

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
slept on the street overnight to cop a

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,239
pair. After working in the sneaker

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
industry for 20 years, I got so tired of

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,239
hearing that Asian-Americans are

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
follower consumers. And that is why we

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,000
started 1587 sneakers because 1587 is

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
actually the year that the first Asian

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,079
is documented to have set foot in what

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
is now known as North America. So when

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,600
people say you're new to this country,

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,720
you're a foreigner. Go back to your

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,240
country. What? We've been here 400

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,400
years. And so that's why we launched

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,600
with the Marorrow Bay. Not only is the

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Maro Bay a throwback to 80s basketball

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
sneakers, Maro Bay is also the exact

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
landing spot for where that first Asian

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,920
step foot in this country. Next, we have

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,439
the AP87. This is a classic tennis

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
silhouette that looks great with any

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,680
occasion. All our sneakers are made with

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
the world's greatest leather and natural

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,280
rubber, so your sneakys will always look

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,759
like a fob. Fresh out the box.

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
So, Sharks, who's ready to walk with us

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,640
and change the sneaker game forever? All

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
right. Love it. Love it. Love it. So, in

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
front of you, we have customized

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
sneakers for each of you. You can smell

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
the leather, feel the quality, feel the

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,520
softness and the comfort. Are you guys

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,360
marketing towards Asians only, or is it

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
just for everyone? So, right now, we're

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
marketing towards Asians. One thing

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,040
we're super excited about, 30% of our

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
customers aren't Asian-American, so we

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
definitely think this has legs with

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,479
everyone. So, walk us through your

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
business model. You're selling direct to

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,240
consumer, correct? Where are you

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
sourcing the product from? It says Italy

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200
in the tag, right? Italy. Yeah, it says

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,879
made in Italy. So up until now we did

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
all our stuff in Italy because they are

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,400
great for small batches and testing

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
concepts. This is my third sneaker

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
startup. So I understand the importance

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
of having good margin. What happened to

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,599
the other two? The first one I was just

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,760
employee number four. We went from

67
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,800
$800,000 to $8 million. Then you started

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,959
the next deal. So that brand was

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
marketed towards African-Americans and

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,040
that company was the first time for me

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,560
being in charge and we learned I learned

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,840
a lot on the woman. So it failed

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,200
miserably is what you're saying.

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
And why is this one going to work and

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
the other two didn't? Great question.

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,239
Cuz our messaging, walk me through that

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
process. I never heard of you. Snap my

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
fingers. I'm Asian now. How are you

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
going to communicate with me? One of our

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,239
greatest assets is Sam. So he's actively

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
involved in the Asian-American community

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
online everywhere. Sam, tell us about

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,720
you. What do you do? So I was actually

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,280
um born in just outside of Boston to a

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
single mom. Uh and she worked every job

86
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
under the sun trying to make things

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,519
work. And it was, you know, the American

88
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
dream tells you come here, you work

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,120
hard, you play by the rules that you can

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,120
achieve anything you want. But watching

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
her working so hard, working three jobs,

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,120
and becoming a small business owner, you

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,040
just realize that that reality wasn't

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
the case for everybody. Yeah. And so I

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,480
decided that I want to dedicate myself

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
to making sure that America lives up to

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,159
the promise that it said it would. And

98
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,239
so for 10 years, I spent my career in

99
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
both government and advocacy work. So

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,159
during the wake of anti-Asian hate and

101
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
the rise of violence, we spoke out a lot

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,959
and we made sure that people were

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
understanding what my community was

104
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,239
going through. So do you have a wide

105
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
following on social media right now?

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
About 250,000 followers. How many people

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,360
follow the company's Instagram account?

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,080
Roughly 7,000.

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,519
Right now your followers, your lifestyle

110
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,959
brand hasn't caught up to the

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,319
opportunity, but I'm still trying to

112
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,080
figure it out. All right. How much does

113
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,560
it cost you to make it and how much you

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,159
sell it for? When we built in Italy, um

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,760
the landed cost was 110, the retail was

116
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,599
2.88, but starting in 3 weeks, we

117
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,319
transferred 90% of our production to

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,560
Asia. So now the landed cost is $50.

119
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,400
We're going to retail at $175. We wanted

120
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,000
to make sure that we also understood our

121
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
worth as a luxury brand shoe and we

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
price it at that point, but also within

123
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,359
reach and accessible to as many people

124
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
as possible. When were you guys founded?

125
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,320
We've only been in operation for 10

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
months. And what are you projected to do

127
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
for revenue this year? We're projected

128
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,960
for 500,000 this year. In the last 10

129
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,880
months, we've done $240,000. So, have

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,759
you calculated your customer acquisition

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,479
cost? Our acquisition cost is $45 and

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,479
our average purchase is 170. You guys

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,000
have to really build the lifestyle part

134
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
of this and that's also going to help

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
you get your customer acquisition cost

136
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
down because right now it's too big of a

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,080
percentage of your profit margins. Well,

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
what do you need? What do you need?

139
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,199
Well, we definitely have to scale. So,

140
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
that's cash. Yep. And be able to get

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
into retail spaces. So, we've already

142
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
started. But are you really designed for

143
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
retail? Because I mean that's hard to

144
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,560
sell in retail, you know, and you don't

145
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
get your mission statement out. Listen,

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't think this is the right business

147
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,600
for me. I'm really not a very good

148
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,280
senior person. I mean, I, you know, to

149
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
get on the treadmill that that's like it

150
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,840
for me. Not the right deal though today.

151
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry I'm out. Thank you so much. We

152
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,320
appreciate that. So guys, the shoe

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
space, which is 80% of your sales, is

154
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
incredibly competitive. The idea of

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,280
going into retail, to me, that's sheer

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,440
insanity. This isn't for me. I'm out.

157
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Listen, in my world, I look at how many

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
points of failure are there between now

159
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
and where this business needs to get to.

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
And the ones that have like three to

161
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
seven points of failure that we can

162
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,759
identify and mitigate and structure

163
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
around, I'm excited about those. And for

164
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
you guys, they're like 25 things that

165
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
need to go right. But the most important

166
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,479
thing for me is the lack of traction. If

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,720
you had a bigger community, if you were

168
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,560
viral like how he is personally and you

169
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
can sell them anything, then I can see

170
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
this as a lifestyle brand and I would be

171
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,880
more excited. But because it's not, I

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,639
I'm out. Here's where I I have a bit of

173
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,320
a challenge with it. I've been in this

174
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,039
business and when I did buy the company

175
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,440
Eonic, I realized so much that goes into

176
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,440
these this this footwear and I don't

177
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
know if I want to take that part of the

178
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
journey with you. Especially if you're

179
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
going into retail where you'll sell out

180
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,840
of all your 9 and 1 halfs and 10 and

181
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
then you have a massive amount of

182
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
inventory sitting there. It's just going

183
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
to deplete your bottom line and those

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
are the things that you're going to have

185
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
to learn before I would be ready to

186
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,319
invest in you. So, good luck. Powerful

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
idea. Uh I'm out. But I love these

188
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,560
sneakers. Yeah, guys, I disagree with

189
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,560
Rashad. You don't have 25 points of of

190
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
failure or problems. You just have to

191
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
find your right path and you want to be

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,759
bigger bigger bigger because you want to

193
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,039
go into retail because you think that's

194
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,000
where you're going to scale. So you

195
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,759
think we should focus on TOC? Yes, 100%.

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,080
Because you have no margin in this

197
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
thing. You'll kill it. Bam, bam, bam.

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
You get to control your own destiny. You

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,319
need to reel it in and just follow the

200
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,960
course that is is organic for you. So

201
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,720
for those reasons, I'm out. Awesome.

202
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,720
Thank you. Good luck, guys. Thank you,

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
guys.
