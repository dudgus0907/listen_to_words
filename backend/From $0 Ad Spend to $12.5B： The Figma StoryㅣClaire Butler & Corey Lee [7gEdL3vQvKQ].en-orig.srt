1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
So the first day that I joined Figma, I

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,520
remember I was sitting in a presentation

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
and Dylan was kind of walking me through

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,280
stuff, showing the product and the name

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,639
of the tool at the time was actually

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
called Summit. And I remember I thought

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,960
to myself like this just isn't going to

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,320
work. Metrics are so important, but I

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
feel like when you're doing something

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,000
really early and you're like, I have to

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
10x this, I have to 100x this, I have

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
to,000x this, you kind of have to go

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
more on intuition and more on feeling, I

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
think, and really believe that because

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,359
metrics just aren't going to get you the

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
answers that you're looking for. If you

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,079
joined Figma, you had to start spending

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,239
time answering support questions. And so

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,920
it sounds like pretty un unscalable,

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,840
right? Oh, you have your engineers

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
sitting there answering support tickets,

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
fixing bugs, like you can't do that

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
forever. That doesn't scale. But

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
actually, it does scale. You think about

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
people as companies. And I think the

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,600
biggest advice that I would give is like

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,199
people are people, right? And I think

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
you see that it can conf like you'll see

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,399
people and you'll talk to them and

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
you'll be chatting. It sounds so basic,

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,920
right? But like I think so often in

32
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
marketing we we split people into like

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,879
you as a person at your desk and you as

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
a person outside of that. Whereas we try

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
to think of people as one person. It

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,200
wasn't like let's have a communitydriven

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
strategy. It was just we need to listen

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
to our users and we need to build a

39
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,479
product that's going to be really useful

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
for them and they know what their

41
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,240
problems are more than we do and we need

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,750
to spend time with them and and fix

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,829
their problems.

44
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,829
[Applause]

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,680
Hi, I'm Claire. Uh, I'm the director of

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,240
brand marketing here at Figma. I was

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
also the first marketer and yeah, I've

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,000
been here since the beginning. So,

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,360
coming up on 9 years of Figma. So, it's

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,159
been it's really fun for me to see

51
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,159
everything come together today.

52
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,360
My name is Cory. I'm designer advocate

53
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,360
here at Figma. Um, I'm based in Tokyo

54
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,000
and I've been here at Figma for about 2

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
years and been a longtime Figma user in

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
community. As a designer advocate, I'm

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,040
part of our community team. My role is a

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,600
mixture of helping build community but

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
while also helping enable um designers.

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,920
So um could you give us an overview of

61
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
your career um before joining Figma?

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
Sure. Uh it's kind of funny. It's hard

63
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
to remember a time before Figma because

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,039
I've been here for uh 9 years. I was at

65
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
another startup before that called

66
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,520
Climate Corporation and Index Ventures

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,239
was one of the investors in uh Climate

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
Corp. and we got acquired and you know I

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,520
kind of knew a big company wasn't for me

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,879
and I I really wanted to roll up my

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
sleeves and and do something early

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,520
stage. So Danny Rhyr who is was the lead

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
investor over at the last company I was

74
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,319
at uh also invested was the first seed

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,519
investor for Dylan. So um I was meeting

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,760
a bunch of different startups and

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
different companies and uh Danny

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,080
introduced me to Dylan and I met Dylan

79
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,319
and kind of just decided that that was

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,480
it and that's that's you know went from

81
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,920
there. When I started at Figma, we were

82
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
pretty launched. So, there was there

83
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
wasn't even a product. There wasn't a

84
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,640
company, you know, there wasn't even a

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
name, honestly. We were going to name it

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
something else at the beginning. So, I I

87
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,560
think back to just how much we've grown

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
and evolved over the past 9 years and

89
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,200
where we are today. And it really blows

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,519
my mind. It's just so amazing to see the

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,280
excitement. I just got emotional

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
watching all the people come in and just

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,879
how many people how many how much Figma

94
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
means to so many people and how many

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
people love it and use it every day.

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
It's just a surreal moment for me to see

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,080
everything come together. What was the

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
first thing that you did after you

99
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
joined Figma? Literal first thing I did.

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,400
So the first day that I joined Figma, I

101
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
remember I was sitting in a presentation

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,319
and Dylan was kind of walking me through

103
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,159
stuff, showing the product, also showing

104
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,840
me where to like the bathroom was like

105
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,560
all of the basics that you get on your

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
first day. And uh I saw one presentation

107
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,599
where they were going through some of

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,120
the branding for Figma and some of the

109
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
different naming and how they were

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
thinking about launching it. And the

111
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,360
name of the tool at the time was

112
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,799
actually called Summit. And so um Figma

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
was always the name of the company, but

114
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,720
we had the strategy at the time where

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
the tool would be called Summit and like

116
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
the Figma editor. And then the company

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,480
would be called Figma. And I remember I

118
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,799
thought to myself like this just isn't

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,040
going to work. Like uh nobody knows who

120
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,519
we are. Summit is just like a really

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
basic name. There's PCs named Summit.

122
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
There's apps named Summit. This isn't

123
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,680
anything we can own. And so I remember

124
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,439
saying just kind of off the cuff like,

125
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
"Hey, like how locked is this? Is this

126
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,120
something we can change?" And Dylan was

127
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
like, "Yeah, what do you think?" And and

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,479
I was like, "Well, I I really think we

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
should probably only have one name. We

130
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,079
can't really have two." Um, and he's

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,079
like, "Well, well, how about you think

132
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,000
about that more and make a presentation

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
and and maybe can show everybody it and

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
then we can talk about it." And I said,

135
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,919
"Okay, cool. Like what does what does

136
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,880
the timeline look like for that?" And he

137
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,160
said, "How about tomorrow?" And I was

138
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,600
like, "Okay." And so uh I remember the

139
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
literal first thing I did on my first

140
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,720
day was um make a presentation about how

141
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,639
the product should be called Figma and

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
not Summit. And that was the first thing

143
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,600
I did. When Figma first launched people

144
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
saying especially among designers like

145
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,120
there are a lot of people liking the

146
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,199
product but also saying oh if this is

147
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
the future of design then I would quit

148
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,639
design or like this is not the future I

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,120
want as a designer. So, as a first

150
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
marketer at uh Figma, like what were

151
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
your like go to market strategy or like

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,800
how did you deal with these market

153
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,440
response? You know, I think it's really

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,199
interesting because as a marketer

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,880
working online and collaboratively, it's

156
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
it's just intuitive to me, right? Like

157
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,800
was used to using Google Docs, was used

158
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,720
to just having Google Slides, a sauna,

159
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,400
these things where you just have things

160
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
constantly updated and working really

161
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
collaboratively. But it didn't really

162
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,680
click for me until I saw the response.

163
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Honestly, that, you know, before design

164
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
didn't really work that way. People were

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
used to working in these offline tools

166
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
and sharing when they're done and doing

167
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,800
these like beautiful presentations and

168
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
showing kind of more of a finished

169
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,960
product. Um, and so yeah, there was a

170
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
lot of questioning uh of that in the

171
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
early days. I think that there's a

172
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,840
couple things that I keep in mind when I

173
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,080
think of like how to approach something

174
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
like that. The first is, you know, you

175
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,560
have to have a level of confidence that

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
you're going to keep going anyway,

177
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,039
right? Like there's some people who

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
don't like it. There's different

179
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,280
adoption curves and it's okay. Not

180
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,120
everyone likes your product right away.

181
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
So this just having a general confidence

182
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,320
in that and a belief that that's the way

183
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,759
to go and that's the vision and we're

184
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,280
going to stick with it is very

185
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
important. And then I think the other

186
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,080
thing that we did that was really really

187
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
helpful was we really looked at design

188
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,759
is an interesting space where uh you

189
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,039
know people really learn from each other

190
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,120
and so people are always looking to

191
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,720
other influencers or other people to

192
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,319
help understand you know what's the

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,800
latest in design how do you work how

194
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
should we work so we really built a lot

195
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,880
of relationships and focused on building

196
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
relationships with people who had a lot

197
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,680
of thought in the space a lot of thought

198
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,440
leadership and um talked to them about

199
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
things. So even if they had a negative

200
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
reaction at first or weren't sure about

201
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,440
something we were doing, we just engaged

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,600
in conversation and talked about it and

203
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,199
uh you know over time heard their

204
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
opinions, we shared our opinions, got

205
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,960
feedback from them and that was a a

206
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
really important thing where maybe

207
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,560
initially people had concerns but as we

208
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
built trust with them, built

209
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,039
credibility, uh people started using the

210
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
tool that was really important and they

211
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,599
changed their minds. I'm also curious

212
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,919
like Corey your response when you first

213
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759
got to know Figma but as a designer

214
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,759
didn't didn't you have any like mixed

215
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,840
feelings towards the product or as a

216
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
designer like what were your thoughts on

217
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,599
the product as a designer at the time I

218
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,000
was using Figma this was probably like

219
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
2016 2017 like a lot of different design

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
tools were coming out like when every

221
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,919
week seemed like there was different

222
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,319
design tool like and I was you know

223
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,160
using one tool as my main tool but like

224
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
I would be using another tool beta

225
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
testing it like on the side and like

226
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
recreating the design like every week

227
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,080
and testing you know, these AB testing,

228
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
these design choices to see like which

229
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
one is the is going to be the best one,

230
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
which one I just I switched to and like

231
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,599
through that whole process, like one of

232
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,840
them I found like Figma and I was using

233
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,599
Figma and I I picked it up for a bit and

234
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,759
I was like, "Okay, this is web- based.

235
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
This is kind of interesting, but like it

236
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
doesn't make much difference compared to

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
like what I'm using now, right?" And

238
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
then um I went back to it for some

239
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,120
reason again to use it and I started

240
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
thinking about the collaboration

241
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,160
features, right? I was just like, "Wait,

242
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,520
wait, you can just Oh, it's web- based.

243
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,280
You can just share a link. I don't have

244
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
to like export this and every single

245
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,879
time it's my final final final final

246
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,080
version. Send that again and then I you

247
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
know I could just share that and it's

248
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
always up to date and thinking about

249
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,400
like the repercussions of that of like

250
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,560
how that would change the way interact

251
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,560
uh and just reduce the friction I think

252
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
was just a big thing I think about a lot

253
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
of time uh in the process. So I was like

254
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
oh well to realize the value that I

255
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
actually have to do use this tool with

256
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,360
somebody else. So that the first thing I

257
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,879
did was okay let me find some other

258
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,319
people on my team that I can get to get

259
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
in the tool and let's use it together.

260
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,680
And then once I did that, they

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,280
understood it. I understood it. I was

262
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,479
like, "Okay, this is a game changer."

263
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
You know, once you start using it

264
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,360
together, you just realize it's like

265
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
it's completely different experience.

266
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
And I think that was when it was

267
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
clicked. And then I realized that and

268
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,479
then I was like, "Oh, I need to get my

269
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
whole team on this. I need to get

270
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
everyone in this and get everyone in the

271
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,800
file." Before I was like going to

272
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
introduce my team to it. There was

273
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,440
actually an issue with like Japanese

274
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,279
input. Um, and you know, back in the

275
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
day, like I you still have it today in

276
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,600
the bottom like right corner of Figma,

277
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
there's a little question mark right

278
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,320
there. And if you push that you can have

279
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,000
like you can send a message right to the

280
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
help desk and get support on that.

281
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
Right? So I was using Figma and when you

282
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
input the Japanese characters it

283
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,440
wouldn't show up correctly. Japanese was

284
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
basically broken in Pigma at the time. I

285
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
was like oh this is great but like I'm

286
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,519
in Japan and like I'm I'm designing in

287
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
Japanese so I can't use this on my team

288
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,519
until this is fixed, right? I was like

289
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
uh maybe I'll just try to send some

290
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,640
support and see what happens, you know?

291
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,720
So I I told him I I sent some

292
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
screenshots. I sent a detailed request

293
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
and I said, "Hey, you know, this thing

294
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
is broken here. and if you could fix

295
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,880
this, this would really be helpful for

296
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
your Japanese users, right? And then

297
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
couple weeks go by and I pick it up

298
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,640
again and it's fixed. And I was like,

299
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
wow, this is pretty nice. I was I was

300
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
like, the tool is pretty cool, but I was

301
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,959
like, what was really really cool was

302
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,640
it's like, oh, I gave this feedback and

303
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,920
then they fix that. But also, I know

304
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
that like they're accepting feedback

305
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
from the community and the speed of that

306
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,000
iteration is is something that it gives

307
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,680
me confidence that um so I think like

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
changing tools is like an investment for

309
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
the whole team. That was kind of me

310
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,640
weighing the option. I was just like,

311
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,240
"Okay, I'm really kind of investing in

312
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
this team and I'm going to tell my team

313
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,839
we should use this this product." So,

314
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,160
you joined Figma before the product

315
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,000
launch. How did you approach marketing

316
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
marketing a product that was still in

317
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
self mode? So, I was the first marketing

318
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
hire, but I was also the first just go

319
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
to market person. In the beginning, when

320
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
we didn't have a product, I would go

321
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,440
around and drive around PaloAlto, San

322
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
Francisco with Dylan, and we would just

323
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,680
pitch Figma to differenti. We made a

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
bunch of connections in different design

325
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,160
teams and we would just go there and we

326
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
we'd show them the product. And so a lot

327
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,040
of what I did in the early days was meet

328
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
these people, gather their feedback,

329
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,240
kind of like what Corey was saying and

330
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
in that more of a one-on-one setting and

331
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,200
hear what they thought about the tool.

332
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
And then uh we were really trying to

333
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,399
understand okay when are we ready to go

334
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,399
at it stealth then launch la la la la la

335
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:34,480
la la la la la la la la la la la la la

336
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:34,560
la la la la la la la la la la la la la

337
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,560
la la la la la la la la la la la la la

338
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,480
la la la la la la la la la la la la la

339
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
la la launch the product and so a lot of

340
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,240
what I was doing was trying to

341
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,800
understand you know our teams ready to

342
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,880
adopt this and is the the tool good

343
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,079
enough to launch. I think it's such a

344
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,000
balance that you have to think about

345
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,760
where it's like, okay, we want to get

346
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,519
out of self and want to get in this this

347
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
people's hands, but if it's not good

348
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
enough, then it's also like, well, we're

349
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,120
going to lose our chance. You only get

350
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,880
one shot to launch. And like, what were

351
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,360
some of the factors that made that

352
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
decision? Yeah, it's hard, right? It's

353
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,040
such a a hard question for people

354
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,600
because you really do only get one

355
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,920
chance to launch the product and you

356
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,839
want to do it right and so you want it

357
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,279
to be good when people are all going in

358
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,959
and looking at the tool. You want them

359
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,560
to have a good experience. So that's on

360
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,160
one hand, but then on the other hand,

361
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
you don't want to wait too long, right?

362
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,200
Because the tool, the team had already

363
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
been building the tool for years before

364
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
I got there. You want to keep things

365
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
going. You want to start building with

366
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,320
people and getting their feedback. And

367
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
so it is a really hard balance. It's

368
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,800
definitely more of an art than a science

369
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,480
in terms of, you know, when to launch.

370
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
And I remember I was sitting in this

371
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,079
meeting and someone literally took the

372
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,360
laptop out of Dylan's hands because they

373
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,640
wanted to play with it. I don't think

374
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,920
that they didn't mean to like didn't

375
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,320
take a laptop, but they were just like,

376
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
"That's so cool. I have to try it." And

377
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,200
I think once they saw people starting to

378
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,440
do that, that was like, "Okay, this is

379
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
this feels like it's kind of ready." One

380
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,000
of the biggest challenges that we had in

381
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,560
terms of deciding when to launch was

382
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,240
multiplayer wasn't actually done when we

383
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,480
launched Figma. It just was going to

384
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,800
take like another year for for

385
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
multiplayer to be done. And so that was

386
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,399
a really hard decision at the time where

387
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
it was like this is our most important

388
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,399
feature arguably and we know it's going

389
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
to take another year before it's done.

390
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
And the decision that we had to make

391
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,320
was, you know, do we launch without

392
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,320
multiplayer or do we wait another year?

393
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
And we decided just to go for it and to

394
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
launch and to start getting feedback,

395
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,240
start getting in people's hands, keep it

396
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
in beta even though we knew it wasn't

397
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
finished. But that is such a hard

398
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
challenge, right? Like I think there'd

399
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,120
be a lot of good arguments on why you

400
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,720
should wait uh for the the core feature

401
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
to be done, but it definitely becomes

402
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,760
kind of more of an art than a science at

403
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,959
that point in terms of making that

404
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,959
decision cuz you also just got to keep

405
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,959
the momentum up too. Metrics are so

406
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,720
important, but I feel like you can't

407
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,800
really look at them that closely when

408
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,200
you're in a micro setting like that. You

409
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,639
kind of have to go on anecdotes, right?

410
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
Like we didn't have enough people to

411
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,959
like have these metrics dashboards and

412
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,040
be like look at the usage over time,

413
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,040
right? Like honestly, we were meeting

414
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,959
these teams and what we looked at was

415
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,200
like at at the beginning, can we get one

416
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,639
team to transfer full-time? And it

417
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
sounds so funny because it's like our

418
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
metric was like zero or one, right? It's

419
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
not like you're looking at these

420
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,000
dashboards. And that's why I feel like

421
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
sometimes when you're doing something

422
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,920
really early and you're like, I have to

423
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,839
10x this, I have to 100x this. I have to

424
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,160
thousandx this. you kind of have to go

425
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
more on intuition and more on feeling I

426
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
think and really believe that because

427
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,519
metrics just aren't going to get you the

428
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,560
answers that you're looking for. What

429
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,519
were your um team or your um plan or

430
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,480
strategy on building this community and

431
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,160
um how important was that at the time? I

432
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,160
wouldn't say in the beginnings we ever

433
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
set out to like have a communitydriven

434
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,240
strategy. Kind of to just take to

435
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
parallel Corey's story with what was

436
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
happening at Figma at the time. In the

437
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,200
early days of Figma, that little

438
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,120
question mark button that Cory was

439
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,120
talking about, uh we didn't really have

440
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
a full-time support team or it took a

441
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,880
while for us to do that. And so our

442
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,880
engineers would rotate and answer those

443
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,440
questions. And so it makes a lot of

444
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,360
sense that somebody reported a bug and

445
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,360
that Corey reported a bug and then one

446
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,120
of our engineers saw that and just fixed

447
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
it, right? Like that's just kind of what

448
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,880
happened. It was really all hands on

449
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,199
deck. And Dylan, our CEO, really

450
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,279
believed that we need to be as close to

451
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,760
the users of our product as possible.

452
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,160
And so even even now that like up until

453
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,880
a long time ago or until recently if you

454
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,199
joined Figma you had to start spending

455
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,040
time answering support questions because

456
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,639
he wanted people to know and understand

457
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,959
what the problems were and be really

458
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,800
close to what that looked like. So

459
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,440
that's been integrated and woven into

460
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,600
who we are since the beginning. And

461
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
along with that it's really building the

462
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,000
product alongside of the users of the

463
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,440
product. It wasn't like we thought to

464
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,720
ourselves like let's have a

465
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,480
communitydriven strategy. It was just we

466
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
need to listen to our users and we need

467
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,399
to build a product that's going to be

468
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,160
really useful for them and they know

469
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,000
what their problems are more than we do

470
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,839
and we need to spend time with them and

471
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,760
and fix their problems. And there's

472
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
people like Corey, like Corey was one of

473
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
those people that put it went into the

474
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,839
chat, but there were thousands of other

475
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,920
Corey's. That idea of listening to

476
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,240
people and then having a personal

477
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,040
relationship, really becoming close with

478
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,440
them and then having them go spread

479
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,519
Figma to their company, to their

480
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,839
communities, to where they live. That's

481
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,079
just what we did at scale. And so it

482
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,680
sounds like pretty un unscalable, right?

483
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,839
Oh, you have your engineers sitting

484
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
there answering support tickets, fixing

485
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,720
bugs, like you can't do that forever.

486
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,519
That doesn't scale. But actually, it

487
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,240
does scale because once we empowered

488
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
him, he can burn it his team. He grew a

489
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,639
community in Tokyo, right? Like that has

490
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,560
a huge amount of ramifications down the

491
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,320
line. Um, and so that's what that

492
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,199
strategy looks like when it when it does

493
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,639
scale, right? It's it's how those people

494
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
these people who you really build these

495
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,199
strong relationships with then spread

496
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,120
Figma for you. That's the whole crux of

497
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,279
a community tribute strategy. The advice

498
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,240
I would give is focus on a niche because

499
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,120
it's so hard to be too broad, especially

500
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,440
when you're new and you're early and you

501
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,279
don't have a brand yet and find out who

502
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
your users are and have somebody who

503
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,279
really understands them be the face of

504
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,440
face of what you're doing. We definitely

505
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,600
started with designers. you were very

506
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,120
focused. It had very specific niche of

507
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,360
designers. They wanted someone who

508
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,880
really understood their pain points,

509
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,320
what they were going through, what it

510
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,399
was like to design. And that's when for

511
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,720
me, I realized that immediately and I

512
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,199
was like, I don't know this. I can study

513
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,959
it. I can I could try and and learn my

514
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
best. I I have over the years, but at

515
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,000
the end of the day, I'm not a

516
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,040
classically trained designer. It's not

517
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,639
my my core expertise. And so that's when

518
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
I you know I decided I was like we have

519
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,320
to hire somebody who knows this really

520
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
really really well and have them be the

521
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,079
face of this and having them be the

522
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
people who are talking with users who

523
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,480
are creating content who are checking

524
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,880
all of our marketing um who are helping

525
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
us do things and that's that's when we

526
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
decided to have a user from the

527
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,360
community come join the team and that

528
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,519
that function has scaled. How did you um

529
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,199
come up with this idea of having like an

530
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,360
offline um community and how did that um

531
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,360
scale also? Totally. So in the early

532
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,720
days uh we did meetups and so that's

533
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,240
what it looked like at the beginning.

534
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,079
Some people were skeptics in the

535
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
beginning, right? And maybe they'd want

536
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,079
to go to meet other designers or they'd

537
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,600
show up, but we realized how valuable it

538
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,319
was to bring people together and to

539
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,000
talk. And we just saw how amazing it was

540
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
when people just learn best practices

541
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
from each other um and just learn from

542
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,240
being together. and we were able to

543
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
build these one relationships, we could

544
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,080
kind of overcome some of their concerns

545
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
or talk them out or just kind of hear

546
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,000
people out on why they were skeptics or

547
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,240
why they weren't sure and how we'd have

548
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,559
these conversations and it might be I

549
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
remember one u Tom was in in Seattle,

550
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,160
Tom, our first designer advocate was in

551
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
Seattle and he was talking to somebody

552
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,640
who at the time was a very big skeptic,

553
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,320
right? Uh and then he kept talking to

554
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
them, had these relationships, built

555
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,720
this relationship with them. Turns out

556
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,880
they were at Uber. Um, and that person

557
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,799
then brought Figma to Uber, right? And

558
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,280
we saw the power of how that process

559
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,640
worked and we started growing just these

560
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,640
people and and having these

561
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,160
relationships. And then we had this

562
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
thought of like, well, wait a minute,

563
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
you know, we've been going to these

564
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,760
different cities, these different

565
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
places. What if we brought everyone

566
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,360
together, right? And what what would

567
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,760
that look like? And it was really funny.

568
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
I remember when we first had the idea,

569
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,840
we're like, okay, how big should it be?

570
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,280
And it sounds so funny and I laugh at it

571
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
now. It was actually we thought we were

572
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
going to be at 200 people and that was

573
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,559
going to be the conference and we even

574
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,880
booked a venue for 200 people that was

575
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,799
the size and we launched the conference

576
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,520
and in the first day we had so many

577
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,440
registrations and people who wants to

578
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,720
join that we're like okay we have to

579
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
change the size of this thing because

580
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
there's no way 200 people is going to

581
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
work. Um and so expanded it and so the

582
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
first config was a thousand people. We

583
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,919
have all these relationships. People

584
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
have these connections online and

585
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,960
because of just the distributed nature

586
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
and the global nature of design, people

587
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,799
have been talking to each other on

588
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
Twitter for so long. But then they all

589
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,720
came together in person and it was just

590
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,320
pure magic to see these people. I

591
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,840
remember so many that the line the

592
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,679
conversation was like, "Oh, that's not

593
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,520
what your avatar looks like on Twitter."

594
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,200
Because this there's a strong community

595
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,640
that existed and that people were

596
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
already meeting each other and talking

597
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
that we've been doing from these

598
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,440
meetups, but also just from the nature

599
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,960
of design. designers have been talking

600
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
and learning to each other regardless of

601
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,679
BIGMA for so long and so bringing

602
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,039
everybody together in person and having

603
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,600
these relationships that were just

604
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,520
online happen in real life was just so

605
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,679
magical that we just knew we had to

606
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,919
continue like so do you have any like

607
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,840
advice on like building communities for

608
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,400
early startups? Totally. I think the

609
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,160
biggest thing is that sometimes in in

610
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
you know especially for us in you know

611
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,720
enterprise marketing or B2B marketing

612
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,160
you think about people as companies and

613
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,480
I think the biggest advice that I would

614
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,919
give is like people are people right and

615
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
I think you see that it can fit like

616
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,880
you'll see people and you'll talk to

617
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,000
them and you'll be chatting and then you

618
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,840
look at their badge and you're like oh

619
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,200
you work at a really big company oh that

620
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
was a company that in theory you might

621
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
want to like target for sales but that's

622
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
not how we think of it we're just like

623
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,080
you're just a person and you have

624
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,919
interest like it sounds so basic right

625
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,400
but like I think So often in marketing,

626
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,480
we we split people into like you as a

627
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
person at your desk and you as a person

628
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,960
outside of that, whereas we try to think

629
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,720
of people as one person and you can just

630
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,880
you're yourself all the time. And sure,

631
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
you happen to work at a company, but uh

632
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
I think it's doing these things that

633
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,640
don't scale and building these

634
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,960
relationships one-on-one like like Gory

635
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,880
and Gory's example and then those people

636
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
bring other people and those then that's

637
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,799
how word of mouth really spreads. So

638
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,600
Figma is beyond just a product. It seems

639
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,840
like it's a brand, it's a community. So,

640
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
um, what are your advice on yeah, making

641
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,799
a brand, you know, I think that the most

642
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
important thing is to actually start

643
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,360
with a product for us and that's like

644
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
what productled growth looks like,

645
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,360
right? And I I think that what we have

646
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,360
as a brand really starts with a brave

647
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,960
product by starting from the bottom up

648
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,960
and saying like, okay, first we have a

649
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,360
really strong product that's awesome.

650
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,360
We're improving it as we go. We're

651
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
listening to feedback um as we're

652
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,200
building it and building it with the

653
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,440
community. And then second, we have you

654
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,960
know these relationships with people and

655
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,280
if those people love the product,

656
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,039
they're spreading it to other people and

657
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,720
that's that's growing over time of

658
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:18,080
community of people. Then we can do it,

659
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,919
right? And then we can say, okay, now we

660
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,919
want to layer on top all these other

661
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,799
things like a 10,000 person conference

662
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,440
or like um you know all these beautiful

663
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,280
visuals that we have. The story of Figma

664
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
is not about ending at Figma. The story

665
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,200
about Figma is where does Figma get in

666
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
that person too. And in most cases, you

667
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,840
know, people using Figma, their story is

668
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,679
something like, you know, I just want to

669
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
create great products. I want to enjoy

670
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
the process and create that product

671
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,559
together. So, the narrative that we're

672
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
creating on the community side is often

673
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,000
like, how do we just enable those people

674
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,520
to get to where they want to go? Do you

675
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,960
know where the name Pigma comes from?

676
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,960
It's It would be great if you can

677
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
explain it to us. Yeah, it's actually it

678
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
comes from the idea of a figment of your

679
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,280
imagination. And the initial vision of

680
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
Fikba was uh to eliminate the gap

681
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,679
between imagination and reality. Like

682
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,679
that was that was the vision. And so

683
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,360
they it kind of shifted for a while

684
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
there cuz uh some people told him it was

685
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
too ambitious. And so it was make design

686
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,960
accessible is kind of where it went to.

687
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
But as we grow and as we continue to

688
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
evolve it, it always comes back to that

689
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,000
like how do you how can we get better at

690
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,559
as a tool helping to make eliminate that

691
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,320
gap um and make it so anybody can have

692
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,480
what they're they have ideas in their

693
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,679
head turn it into a product or turn it

694
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,679
into something that a's world
