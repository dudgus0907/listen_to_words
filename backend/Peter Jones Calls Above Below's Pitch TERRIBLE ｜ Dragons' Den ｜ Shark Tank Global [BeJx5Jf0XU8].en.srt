00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,559
Hello

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,599
dragons. My name is Will. This is

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,560
Lauren. Hi. The business I run is called

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,880
Above Below. And over the last three,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,199
four years, we've been developing a new

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,560
outdoor

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,080
activity. We call it crosscountry

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,760
swimming.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,280
What we do is we combine the above,

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,000
which is a hike, with a swim, the

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,920
below. When you combine these two

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,120
things, there's a magic happens, an

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,440
alchemy. There's all of the mental

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,879
health benefits of being outside. Then

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,520
you've got all the euphoria of being

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,600
immersed in cold

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,160
water. Our objective is to get as many

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,680
people as possible to enjoy this

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,719
activity. And we do that by being the

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,320
first. And we think the best at building

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,559
the roots, the

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:08,080
events, and the kit that makes this

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,080
whole activity practical, accessible,

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,680
possible. Events. We've had 2,000 people

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,439
do our events. Um, we host a sort of

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,119
slightly infamous event in London where

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,840
you run and swim during the winter

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,240
through all the parks and ponds. It's

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,240
called the swimmer.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,840
Uh, so what Laurens's doing is

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,680
transforming with our ruck raft. This is

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
the first product we made and we know

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,079
it's a niche, but it's patented. It does

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,799
what it says. Uh, it's a raft for your

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,320
rucks sack. And then around that over

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,320
the last 12 months, we've started to

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
build some other bits of kit that make

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,399
that transition to land to water a bit

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,320
more comfortable, uh, a bit more

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,799
accessible. So when you've been

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
swimming, warm up your head and your

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
trunk. So we've made a hat. Will, this

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,479
is supposed to be a pitch, not a story.

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,560
A whole So be really clear on what

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
you're pitching. Yeah. Is it the product

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
or is it the activity or Yeah. So it's

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,760
our whole business is how to get more

49
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,280
people to do it and we make the kit and

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,840
the roots to make it possible. So how

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,319
much do you want at what percent? Yes.

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,879
So we've sold 20% of our stuff all over

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,640
the

54
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,040
world. So we think what we can do for

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
our sort of slightly we we're small.

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
We're small. You haven't answered my

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,560
question. What's your question? Sorry.

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,440
The What are you asking for? We are

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,680
asking for Â£100,000 5% of the business.

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
All right. That's better. Yeah. And with

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
your help, we think we can grow this

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
niche and that's what we want to do. Is

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
that the end of your pitch or do you

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,640
want to introduce what you're going to

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
do? a demonstration or what is what is

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,319
going on now? So, um this is what

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Lauren's done. We're going to put this

68
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,080
in the water so you can see it float.

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Great.

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
You can now set off for a swim and then

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
you get to the other side. You've got

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,000
all your kit with you. It unlocks the

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,040
landscape to new adventures.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,720
A protracted pitch from fresh air fiend

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,280
Will Watt, who's seeking

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,560
100,000 in return for a 5% share in his

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
company. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
you, Lauren. Thank you.

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Peter Jones is first to take the plunge

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,840
with the questions.

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,879
Will

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,120
um I don't often say this, but your

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,560
pitch was awful.

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,239
Oh, there didn't seem to be anything

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,879
there that you could hold on to that

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,959
actually says this is an amazing product

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,040
for this

88
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,080
reason. This is who is going to buy it.

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
This is why we're going to be

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,720
successful.

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,560
I don't understand

92
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,519
this. What is the business that you're

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,319
pitching? Um, as I tried to so

94
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,440
strategically we have roots which is

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,799
really important. I mean what we're

96
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,720
doing is in a way you're market making.

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:06,080
This is a new activity that has a you're

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,720
doing it again. Will the business roots

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,200
what does roots do? Shows people where

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,720
you can go. Roots is a race. Roots is a

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,239
race. It's like if you're in

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
mountaineering, you need to when you go

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,359
out. Sorry. Roots is You have this most

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,240
bizarre way of answering questions. Oh

105
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,320
god. Which doesn't answer them, right?

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,360
What's

107
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,240
roots? Is it a race? No. Roots are roots

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,639
that you can swim and hike in. So roots

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,120
are roots that you can swim and hike.

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
And then events are things that we host.

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Okay. And then the third part is

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,040
product. this product.

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,080
So, Will,

114
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,639
I'm not going to ask you too many

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,479
questions about how this all works cuz

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
there's an expert amongst one of our

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,680
dragons. I don't know if we'd call me an

118
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
expert just cuz I've been out lake

119
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
swimming a couple of times, but I

120
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,479
absolutely love that you would put me in

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,000
the expert field when there's an expert

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,120
here.

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,160
Compared to me, she'd be an expert.

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,320
So, let's let's just start. What

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,960
proportion in the first year of your

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,960
sales was the event and what proportions

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
was product?

128
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,039
Yeah. So 2019 I mean we we're not doing

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
this properly at this point. The thing

130
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,520
that's funding it is actually the

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,199
swimmer event in London. All right. It

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,720
got very popular. I appreciate that. We

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,560
would put it into this. I just want some

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:33,080
numbers. 2020 26k revenue 8k loss. Yeah.

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,960
The end of 2020 we

136
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,960
crowdfunded. So how much have you

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,039
raised? So we raised 328,000

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,160
328

139
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,880
2021

140
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:53,440
56k revenue minus 40 loss. Yep. And 22

141
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,900
to 23. Yeah. 55k revenue and minus 180

142
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,990
loss.

143
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,990
[Music]

144
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,600
So, I'm assuming you've got a valuation

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
of 2 million. Yeah. Hang on. Did you

146
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,520
miss that last number, by the way, cuz

147
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,720
that made me gasp. Yeah. Minus 180. I'm

148
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
going to I'm going to You got a

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,520
valuation of 2 million. Yeah. So, I'm

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,680
assuming somewhere you got 1.8 in cash.

151
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,360
No.

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
So, what are you valuing at 2 million

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,759
though? What part of the business?

154
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
Because the roots you you're not valuing

155
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
roots at 2 million. I don't imagine

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,039
you're valuing the races which you said

157
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,120
only 2,000 people have attended at 2

158
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,240
million. So is it this floating device

159
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,280
you're valuing at 2 million? Um I to me

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,080
the value is in we've created a whole

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,800
new category of activity. We've created

162
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,440
a worldwide patented product that

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,120
doesn't have any competitors at all.

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,720
What's the patented product? The RPR.

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,960
But it won't be patented. That's just

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
going to be a design patent.

167
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Yeah, a a design. Well, that's that's

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
worthless.

169
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,479
What have you got a patent on? The whole

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,319
of the rock rafter kit. The design of

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,919
it. So, if I change a few things of

172
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
that, I can still bring out the same

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,720
product. You would have to make it

174
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,479
heavier. Why couldn't it be lighter? Uh

175
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,639
because anything below is it would

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,599
infringe the patent.

177
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,240
So, this is the thing worth 2 million.

178
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,800
Uh I think no. I I I would I would say

179
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,240
that the whole uh lifestyle, business

180
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,680
and brand around the thing and what it

181
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,360
enables in the same way that Patagonia

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
started making carabiners that enabled

183
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
climbing and then grew that's where we

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
want to get. How big is your brand in

185
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,960
terms of give me community size? 5,000

186
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Instagram.

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,360
I don't think that's Patagonia.

188
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,639
Not yet. No. Not yet. No. I think this

189
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
is I've been in the den for three years

190
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
now. I think this is the steepest

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,479
valuation I've ever seen. And yeah, in

192
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
relation to the value that I see before

193
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,240
me and the business I see before me,

194
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,879
55k revenue you made, you lost almost

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,960
200k profit last year and the business

196
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,120
is worth 2 million.

197
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, that is I mean, not to use one of

198
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,560
Peter's phrases, but that's cuckoo land.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
That's really something. It doesn't make

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,160
sense to me, so I'm going to say that

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm out.

202
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, I I still sit here really

203
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,120
bewildered. This this is I'm going to

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,000
relay to you what this looks like

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
sitting here in this chair. A business

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,839
that's not just failing to grow. It's

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,399
actually going slightly backwards. And

208
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,040
then when you raise some money from

209
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,160
crowdfunding, you manage to make a

210
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:52,080
40,000 loss into 180,000 loss.

211
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,279
So, at what point does it make money?

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Well, I mean, it would make money. So,

213
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,640
can I just talk about in sales terms?

214
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
It' be better if you answer the

215
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,800
questions. If we sold a,000 units of the

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,360
body warmer and the ruck, we break even

217
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,640
around a a revenue of 300. And when will

218
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,240
that be? Year five. We think it'll take

219
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,399
us 5 years. So, by year five, I've

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
recouped all of the losses that you've

221
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,360
made so far. Yes. And we've got a

222
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,839
business. Does that sound like a good

223
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,839
investment to you?

224
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,120
I think it I I think in all honesty, I

225
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
think it probably depends on what type

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
of investment you're looking for. We

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,920
know. We know. Sorry. Well, I'm looking

228
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,120
for an investment that makes a

229
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,720
return on my investment. Yeah. Listen.

230
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,200
Well, you actually seem like a really

231
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,480
nice guy. Okay.

232
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,839
But this is a really bad

233
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,600
pitch. There's there's just given me no

234
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,160
reason to invest. So, I'm afraid I won't

235
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,160
be will I'm out.

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,040
Will, let me tell you where I stand,

237
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,959
right? Um, you seem like a very nice

238
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,399
guy, but to me, listening to you, you're

239
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,600
like a raft stuck in the middle of the

240
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,440
sea. I don't know which way to

241
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,640
go. So therefore, I'm not going to give

242
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,560
you a lifeline, and I'm

243
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,160
[Music]

244
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:15,760
out. Um, without being brutal, this is a

245
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,360
really unfocused pitch. Yep.

246
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,720
This pit should have been very much

247
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,839
predicated on I've created a global

248
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,200
patented inflatable rucks

249
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,640
sack. And the reason why I've done that

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,560
is because 10 to 20,000 people are out

251
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,600
swimming up and down just in the UK

252
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,399
alone and they don't have this

253
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,040
product and they're all going to want

254
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,959
it. and then go to by the way I know

255
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,279
it's going to be successful because I

256
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,640
run trails at the moment from Lan's end

257
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,399
to Jona Gro and everybody wants to buy

258
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,760
this you've explained the

259
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:02,240
rationale you've explained what it is

260
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,240
you've explained why people will want

261
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:12,000
it and you didn't do that

262
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,000
yeah and you haven't given yourself a

263
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,320
So, for that reason, I'm

264
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,720
out. But I just hope you take a lot away

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,560
today because you could have something.

266
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
Yeah. No, I think that's a beautiful

267
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,920
description of what I was trying to get

268
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,920
across and I wish I had done that.

269
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,720
Will, I loved your pitch. I enjoyed

270
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
every word. I was right there with you.

271
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,279
I genuinely did look I wanted to invest

272
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
in this business so bad with my heart.

273
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,200
Didn't even let my head get a look in

274
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,640
because I was so excited. I thought I

275
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
can do this. I can get on board with

276
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
him. Really passionate about it. And

277
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
then I'm sat there listening to these

278
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,959
guys and I'm thinking by they're being a

279
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,920
bit mean

280
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,160
today. But you've got to think about

281
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
your

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,959
audience. One out of the five of us was

283
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,720
potentially into this. And to everybody

284
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,600
else's point, you've done a terrible job

285
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
of selling the

286
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,839
business. You've sold the dream, but you

287
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,399
haven't sold the investment.

288
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,079
Yeah. So, I'm going to say I'm

289
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,440
out. And I know it's been a tough time,

290
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
but I hope you've had a lot of learning

291
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,440
from it. Yeah, we we have. Thanks, Will.

292
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,440
Well done. Good luck with

293
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,480
Will leaves the den with plenty of

294
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,480
advice but no investment.

295
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm a bit deflated.

296
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,760
Started badly and got worse. Peter which

297
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
had right out of the gate was like right

298
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,160
that was the worst I've ever seen. I was

299
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,839
like oh man. But you've got to do these

300
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,360
things. Got to put yourself under the

301
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
scrutiny.

302
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,639
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

303
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,639
again.
