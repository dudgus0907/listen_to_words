1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,120
that's really been exciting about

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,800
building this company, especially over

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,120
the past year as code generation has

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
gotten so good. As agents get better and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,559
better at generating code, the the way

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,560
that you're interacting with them

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,359
probably isn't going to look like how we

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,760
we write code today. it's v 0ero bolt

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,119
new replet agent like something like

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,800
that where you know where you're

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,880
interacting with these agents and

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
prompting them and and iterating on

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,920
their experiences and it's almost more

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,320
analogous to code review than it is to

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
how we would write code previously and

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,399
that's why we think like owning code

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,800
review as as the starting point is what

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
matters you know far more so than the

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
fist fight that's happening over like in

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
loop code generation right

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,960
Hi, I'm Mel Lutzky, co-founder and CEO

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,039
of Graphite. Graphite is the code review

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
platform for the age of AI. We take

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
best-in-class workflows and tooling from

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,280
companies like Google and Meta and

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,760
combine them with our agentic AI code

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
review companion to help engineers uh

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
create, review, and merge code changes

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
faster than ever. We work closely with

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,119
the team at Enthropic um to power our AI

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,000
code review agent um called Diamond. The

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,799
series B that we just announced was $52

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,150
million. Um, and Graphite has grown 20x

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,600
in the past

35
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:28,560
[Music]

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,400
year. Graphite started on a completely

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,479
different idea. We actually we actually

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
had sort of two one small pivot in the

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,640
beginning in the first three months and

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,520
then then the iOS tool. We'd hired in

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,640
the process then a few engineers uh a

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,320
few of Tomas's ex-coorkers from Meta and

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
this we'd had this really peculiar thing

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,560
that happened when when they onboarded.

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
So they'd start on their first day we'd

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
get them set up on GitHub. We'd show

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,040
them how we do code review at the

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,360
company and all of them had this kind of

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,280
allergic reaction to it immediately and

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
they all said you know this feels like

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
so much slower than the tooling that I'd

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,560
had at Meta. I I feel like a caveman

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,640
using this. Google and Meta have both

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
built amazing internal tools to help

55
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,720
their their teams of thousands or tens

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,080
of thousands of engineers um all working

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,239
on on one monor repo at once even across

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
across time zones and across you know

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
spanning these massive code bases. And

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,920
um if you go outside of those walls

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,400
though u it's very hard to to get that

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,560
same level of of productivity and uh

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
have that same that same tool chain. And

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
that was a lot of why, you know, why we

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,800
started Graphite was we saw kind of the

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,319
the gap between what we'd had at at the

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,480
large companies that that all us and the

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,040
founding team had worked on and what was

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,959
available to every company when they're

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
just getting started. And um that was

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
really what inspired us to to build

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,519
graphite. I think it's so important to

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
like deeply understand and care about

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
the user that you're building for.

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,519
You're going to spend if your company is

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
successful, you know, 10 plus years

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
talking to these people every single

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
day. And if you don't genuinely care

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
about making their lives better, about

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,120
solving their problems and about

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
building uh product experience they

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,040
really enjoy using and get a ton of

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
value from, it's going to be really hard

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,800
to just sustain your your level of

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
enthusiasm about that. And one of the

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,400
the things that's so fun about graphite

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
and one of the best parts about getting

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
to work on this is that it is something

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,640
that we all on the team use every day. A

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
lot of like great companies use every

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
day. our friends at at these companies

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
are are using and are constantly texting

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,799
me with feedback. It's just fun to be

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
able to to build something that that's

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,760
for um a user that we're so you know

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,920
that we're so deeply familiar with and

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,920
um that we genuinely care about and and

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
want to like make their lives better. So

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,239
in the beginning we started with tool

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,799
for creating stacked pull requests. The

101
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
idea of stack pull requests um is that

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,120
instead you you break and having that

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,319
all be one pull request um instead you

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480
break that up into a series of small

105
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,080
dependent changes um that all sort of

106
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
chain together and build upon each

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
other. And the advantage of this is that

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,200
you know first of all nobody likes to

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
review like a thousand line pull

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
request. that's like, you know, there's

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,239
that meme that's like, you know,

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
thousand lines like looks good to me.

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
And I think that that really is is what

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,639
you see play play out in the data. Like

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,959
nobody wants to to like give a detailed

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
review to a change that big. Um that's

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,520
really why, you know, why stacking is is

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,199
so powerful is it just it gives you so

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
much time back um that you would have

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
spent kind of sitting on your hands or

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,960
trying to find something else to build.

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
And we've seen like really meaningful

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
improvements in in development speed at

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,759
many of our top customers. ASA was the

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,919
one where where we save 7 hours per

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,320
developer per week. At RAMP, we

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
increased their development speed by 3x.

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,680
One of our adviserss kind of famously

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
said like once you stack, you don't go

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
back. And I think that that's really

131
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,440
true in terms of the both like the user

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,440
excitement and then also just the the

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,360
retention numbers and and you know the

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,919
engagement that we see with graphite

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,919
pretty much every

136
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,080
day as every engineer has tools like you

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,759
know cursor and windsurf and copilot and

138
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
even some of these more agentic code

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,800
generation tools now uh they're able to

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,039
like write code faster than ever uh they

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,880
can they can do or they're creating more

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,800
code changes than than they ever have

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,800
before. That's only really the first

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,479
part of the story. I think even what

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
we're seeing with with vibe coding right

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,120
now is a lot of those products are kind

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,039
of MVP like there. You still need to

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
take that change and get it through code

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,720
review. You still need to test it. You

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
still need to deploy it and measure the

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
impact. and that whole kind of outer

152
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,880
loop process um where you're

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
collaborating with your teammates that's

154
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,199
like a huge part of of your life you

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
know almost as much in many cases as the

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199
inner loop of of how I'm like writing

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,160
code testing locally and getting it

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,039
ready to uh to like push up to to a pull

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
request. So I think that as you know as

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,080
you have like this this idea of like

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
vibe coding and AI code generation it's

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
almost not enough to be just you know

163
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,720
engineer anymore like the best engineers

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
are also great product thinkers and

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
great business thinkers great designers

166
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
in some cases it's really it used to be

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,680
the case I think that the limiting

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,680
factor on creating anything was was you

169
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
know asking like how do I actually build

170
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
this and how do I implement it now you

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
have these great tools that can help you

172
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,080
answer that question and kind of get to

173
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,319
an early version like a working

174
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,880
prototype of of something like quite

175
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,160
quickly. So then the question shifts

176
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,319
from being like how do I build this to a

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
little bit further upstream of like what

178
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
should I build in the first place that's

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
actually going to be of value? you know

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
how do I actually interact with this and

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,120
what is the optimal experience here and

182
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,759
then how do I differentiate that and how

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
do I in a world where like anybody can

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,600
you know go on replet agent and prompt

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,600
you with a few prompts make you make

186
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,280
make like a working prototype of

187
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,759
something how is that different from

188
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,000
anybody else's like vibecoded version of

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,759
this and I think that that software

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,080
engineering looks a lot more like you

191
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,360
know reviewing or even designing or or

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,720
like you pming in the future versus like

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,720
writing code as we know it today.

194
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,039
the transformation of software

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
engineering uh with AI code generation

196
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,440
is has just been the sort of seismic

197
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,039
shift that's happened in you know as

198
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,639
we've been building the company and you

199
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,039
know we were fortunate in that we were

200
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,440
working on solving a problem that was

201
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,160
now made 10 times worse by AI code

202
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,240
generation code review has always been

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
and this outer loop of review and

204
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
testing and deployments has always been

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,440
a bottleneck at large companies it's

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,720
always been an area that that needs

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,680
better tools And that was true before

208
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,000
AI, but now with with all these great AI

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
code generation tools, that need is is

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,440
all the more acute. And I think that's

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,560
that's one of the things that's been I

212
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,400
think we were lucky that we were

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,520
building kind of the the right thing at

214
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,840
the right time. U because we built uh we

215
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,160
built tooling for accelerating the outer

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,639
loop and we got that into a lot of great

217
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,120
enterprise customers. We also built the

218
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,440
trust with those organizations to be

219
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
able to now deploy AI to help them

220
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,360
review code faster. Uh I think it's

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,160
really hard if you're just starting an

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
AI code review company to convince an

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
enterprise or convince a company like

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,919
Shopify to give you access to their

225
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,599
entire GitHub repo from day one. It's

226
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,599
taken us a long time to build up that

227
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,840
level of trust. And I I think there are

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,919
a few factors there. One is just like

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,399
building just adding value progressively

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
over time, shipping features constantly,

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,080
like showing the customers that we work

232
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
with early on that we are consistently

233
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
able to like deliver on our promises and

234
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,839
you know continue to just add more and

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,760
more great features to the graphite

236
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
platform. Um we spend a lot of time

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
making sure that that everything we do

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
is like you know best practices for

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,200
security. We're pentested very

240
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
regularly. Like we really want to invest

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
in in making sure that that that piece

242
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,880
is is central to what we're doing you

243
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,480
know. And then and then part of it is

244
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
just climbing the ladder. I think you

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
have to you have to start with like

246
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,760
smaller companies first like you're

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
always going to have kind of more you

248
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,839
know smaller companies that are willing

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
to adopt tools tools in the beginning

250
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
and then like building up trust over

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,839
time and I think now that snowball has

252
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
really like started to roll and um we

253
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,040
have you know some of some of the

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,880
largest technology companies out there

255
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,560
that are are trusting graphite every day

256
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,839
and u you know we're we're really

257
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
privileged to be able to serve
