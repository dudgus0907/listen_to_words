1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,120
is it's really easy to create a company

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,040
in gen in demo mode it is a very

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,480
different thing to take that beautiful

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,480
demo and put it in the wild and scale it

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,080
and we've already seen a handful of

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
companies that you know were backed by

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,240
amazing investors kind of blow up

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,279
because they weren't able to transition

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
from that really cool slick demo into

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,560
the wild essentially into full

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,400
production the biggest question we have

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,119
for companies is they come to us and we

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,279
like the beautiful demo come to us when

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,279
you have a customer that's live

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,760
my name is Rebecca Lynn I'm the founder

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,879
and managing partner of canas Ventures

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,360
canvas Ventures is an early stage

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,640
Venture Capital firm that focuses on

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,960
investing in financial services digital

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,760
Health Andi so some of the most recent

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,440
outcomes of canvas Ventures are case

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,120
Tech Gabby and futur advisor and

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,120
importantly case text was a very early

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,239
exit with AI and gp4 and they exited to

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,680
Thomson reuter about 650 million Gabby

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,519
was acquired by Experian and future

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,519
adviser by Black

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,560
Rock so I have always been a believer in

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,680
in second mover I think first mover

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,920
Advantage is a fallacy and the reason is

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,320
is that it takes a lot of money and time

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,320
and patience to really prove out a brand

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,680
new market and once you prove it out you

34
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,119
have a ton of technical debt I invested

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,079
in Lending Club and from then on Lending

36
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,320
Club ended up being the largest US tech

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,840
IPO in 2014 and so lendy Club wasn't the

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,600
first mover there was a company out

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,079
there called Prosper who had really hit

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,759
the market first the best position to be

41
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,479
in in my opinion of a company is the

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,520
startup that lets another company kind

43
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,240
of seed the market prove that there's a

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,360
market there and then they can take that

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,240
learning and come up very quickly with a

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
better product and better marketing and

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,600
no technical debt I would challenge

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,759
anyone to to come up with more than just

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,000
a handful of companies that are public

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,560
today that truly were the first mover

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
there are very

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,399
few I think the most important

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,920
characteristic of a CEO is salesmanship

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,280
really a CEO's job all the time is sales

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,239
you're selling to your customer you're

56
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,519
selling to your employees you're hiring

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,239
people you are constantly selling the

58
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,800
company that in my opinion really most

59
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,120
clearly defines a CO who listens to

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,440
their customer and then is a great sales

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,120
leader it was Jeff tagney at doximity he

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,160
from the very beginning brought on a

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,280
customer advisory committee to help

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,720
inform him of you know what was

65
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,239
important to his end users in the

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,840
product and what wasn't and where to

67
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,599
take it very early on he would bring in

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
this advisory panel to like an on-site

69
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,840
sort of strategy session and they would

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,480
wireframe me of five six seven different

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,680
ideas and show them to this you know

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,159
panel of end users that would really

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,879
feed into their entire product road map

74
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,519
and he did that from the beginning so

75
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,239
when I'm evaluating whether a CEO really

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,959
possesses sort of the salesman ship it

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,360
becomes blazingly obvious as they're

78
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,920
pitching us you want a CEO who can sell

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
you on their Vision because of their

80
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,959
excitement and how they thought about it

81
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,680
and that they've talked to the consumer

82
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,519
and you also want them to be incredibly

83
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,799
honest and forthright with you as the

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,440
same time because that's what ERS trust

85
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,159
when you're in the sales process so when

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,120
we ask a CEO about you know their ARR

87
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,040
and is it booked or is it forecasted

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,760
having that c be very open and

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,120
transparent and upfront I think shows us

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,920
that they are going to not only earn our

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
trust but the trust of their customers

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,599
and that's really important especially

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,599
early

94
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,200
on the mistake most startups make when

95
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,120
they're scaling is that they believe too

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
early they have product Market fit and

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,920
they believe they they've got it and

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,920
then they go out and they hire a very

99
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,599
expensive salesperson who then wants to

100
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,959
hire a bunch of people and they just

101
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,159
burn a ton of cash too early and then

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
they have to let that salesperson go and

103
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,239
then go back to the drawing board and

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
kind of sort out a little bit more you

105
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,079
know what those elements of product

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Market fit are and then rehire it's hard

107
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,840
to watch I think almost every startup

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,799
does this especially in the Enterprise

109
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,720
space and and our advice is you know

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,079
just way to beat hire maybe that

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,000
director level salesperson who can help

112
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,600
you maybe a chief of staff that can help

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,479
you in in your sales efforts and then

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,040
really make sure you scale gradually

115
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,280
when you think you have product Market

116
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,680
fit have some more checkpoints you know

117
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,199
before you go out and pay a lot of money

118
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,560
for a head sales person person before

119
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,440
you have product Market fit you know

120
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,400
what there's an example so case text

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,520
pretty early thought they had product

122
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,720
Market fit and they hired a very good

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
you know Season sales executive to come

124
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,600
in they spent quite a bit of money on

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,479
the sales exact and the team and it it

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,479
wasn't working they weren't getting the

127
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,039
traction that they had hoped for this is

128
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,440
before they launched co- counil the GPT

129
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,840
4 product the founder to his credit made

130
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,759
a pretty quick early decision to let

131
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,000
that team go and it was really hard you

132
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,000
know the salesperson was great it wasn't

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,560
an issue with them it was an issue with

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,160
you know where we were at that time with

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
the product you know it was really about

136
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
supporting the founder he kind of saw

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
also that was the right answer but it

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,440
was a hard answer it was a hard thing

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,400
for him to execute and so helping him

140
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,800
think through how to message it how to

141
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,199
make that happen and introducing him to

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,280
other Founders who've had to make

143
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,720
similar tough choices so that he can get

144
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,440
their firsthand experience and advice

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
was really helpful often times the

146
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,520
founder does have Instinct and data that

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,240
I don't so I first seek to understand

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,600
why they're heading in the direction

149
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,319
they're heading and then if we become

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,240
pretty convinced that it is the wrong

151
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,360
direction we try to show not tell and so

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,120
we we try to find the right people to

153
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,080
introduce them to that will offer them

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,680
you know a more complete picture of the

155
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,199
way we're thinking about the world and

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
often times we get there it's not that

157
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,720
they were completely in the wrong

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,880
direction and we were right often times

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
there's some kind of meeting in the

160
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,600
middle I think the first thing that we

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,759
need to do is check our assumptions

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
understand where the founder is coming

163
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,199
from and then get them the resources if

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,479
they do need to make a shift and they

165
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,199
decide they make a shift like help them

166
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,960
on that journey and it does happen I me

167
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,680
there's I think every company it's often

168
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,360
times many stages you has to Pivot

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
either from strategy or product or

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Channel or you know whatever it might be

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,080
and when they they get there you know

172
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,639
our job is to help them figure out how

173
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,639
to make that

174
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,520
shift what do you do when a potential

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,360
client says we love your product but

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,880
it's way too expensive do you give in on

177
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,840
discounts right away or can you

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,960
confidently defend your price hi I'm

179
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,520
Peter on with over 15 years of sales

180
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,680
experience at companies like Google

181
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,440
Dropbox and slack I've obsessed over how

182
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,080
to effectively answer questions like

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,000
this in a way that builds trust that's

184
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,319
why I created Peter on sales school with

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,879

[Music]

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,400
school so there's a ton of opportunity

202
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,080
in gen the clear thing that we has come

203
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,919
to us is it's really easy to create a

204
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,000
company in gen in demo mode to create

205
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,479
this beautiful demo that blows everyone

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,400
away it is a very different thing to

207
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,599
take that beautiful demo and put it in

208
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,560
the wild and scale it and we've already

209
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,919
seen a handful of companies that you

210
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,599
know were backed by amazing invest ERS

211
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,680
kind of blow up because they weren't

212
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,759
able to transition from that really cool

213
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,479
slick demo into the wild essentially

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,240
into full production the biggest

215
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,319
question we have for companies is they

216
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,800
come to us that's a beautiful demo come

217
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,919
to us when you have a customer that's

218
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,560
live for the CEOs who come to us to

219
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,000
pitch sort of their series A and B

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,280
companies and even we look at a lot of

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,360
seed deals also the questions I ask are

222
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,080
really about how's the consumer using

223
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
the product what have they learned from

224
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,680
the consumer since they started the

225
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,960
company what was surprising to them what

226
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,680
thesis proved what was different and

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,519
what I'm looking for is that they're

228
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,399
listening they're actually looking for

229
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,320
that feedback from their users and that

230
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,919
they're listening and they're adjusting

231
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,159
accordingly right that they're not sort

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,360
of dogmatically adherent to maybe

233
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,000
solving their own problem that was what

234
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,279
you know the company stem from that

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,279
they're listening to what their end

236
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,600
users really want and need the second

237
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,120
thing I really look for from the CEOs is

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,160
what gets them out of bed in the morning

239
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,800
they really motivates them to do a

240
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,680
startup because there's going to be

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,000
really really hard times in the startup

242
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,519
there always are what is it about them

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
that is driving them forward what's

244
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,560
going to help them pick themselves up

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,160
when things get really hard and Shake

246
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
themselves off and keep going and so I

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
always like to hear the CEO's stories

248
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,360
all of them could easily go get a job

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,160
and get paid you know quite a bit of

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,519
money at a big company and what is it

251
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,560
about this particular opportunity that

252
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,560
is really energizing

253
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,480
them I was motivated to found cus

254
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,720
Ventures because I wanted to create the

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,200
Venture firm that I would want to fund

256
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
my startup I didn't start inventure

257
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,839
Capital thinking I would be here you

258
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,360
know a decade plus later when I started

259
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,240
in Venture Capital it was really a GU I

260
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,800
was going to start Venture Capital learn

261
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,519
how they made decisions and I was going

262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
to get them to invest in the company

263
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,880
that I was working on and unfortunately

264
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,000
I enjoyed the job so much that I I

265
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,720
remained adventure with canvas this is

266
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,880
my startup and one of the things I I try

267
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,200
to stress is just be more confident in

268
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
yourself one of the most formative

269
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,399
things was you know what my best friend

270
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,839
from business school where we're taking

271
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,040
a leadership class

272
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,440
and we had to rank ourselves we had all

273
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,680
of these things and we had to rank you

274
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
know one through five you one being the

275
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,200
best how good you were at everything and

276
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,839
then we had to get up and say what we

277
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
ranked ourselves and you know everyone

278
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,160
was pretty you know I don't know modest

279
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,560
or whatever and she's like I'm a one I

280
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,240
was I was like who is this person right

281
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,480
and she just explained in the world of

282
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,440
banking that's the first thing they

283
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,519
teach you like fight for yourself

284
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,279
because you know you're working for

285
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
somebody else and why would anyone want

286
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,440
to hire you unless at least you believe

287
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,279
that you were the best possible person

288
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,920
for that job and that really stuck with

289
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,640
me you know why would I expect somebody

290
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,360
to invest in me give me money give me

291
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,320
that promotion if I didn't believe I was

292
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,680
the best person for that job be more

293
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,519
confident in yourself no one's going to

294
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,519
believe in you more than you
