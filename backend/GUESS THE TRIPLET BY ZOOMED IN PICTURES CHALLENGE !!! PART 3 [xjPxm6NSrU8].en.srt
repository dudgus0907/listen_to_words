blast from the past a big old blast from

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,439
the past I changed to gray cuz you were

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,440

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,559
gray we got we took we took a walk in

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,320

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,480
that and it just happens to conveniently

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,559
work in multiple ways basically we went

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,079
down a rabbit hole of watching some of

17
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,239
our older videos mhm and just

18
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,879
reminiscing you know feeling the

19
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,960
Nostalgia really no I just like I was I

20
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,840
love watching the old like videos of me

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,240
Matt and Nick like doing our challenges

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
and whatnot but cuz it's like actually

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,400
mindboggling like we were just watching

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,560
it like literally on our TV minutes ago

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,880
and I was like I cannot believe that I

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,240
sound the way I sound I look the way I

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,439
look cuz I remember being in that

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,759
situation but I don't remember talking

29
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,680
and or looking all it's crazy to look at

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,400
all that type of stuff cuz us blurring

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,200
out the word [ __ ]

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,040
yeah like we censored the word [ __ ] in

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,200
our video no it's just crazy to me cuz

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,119
it's like it's crazy cuz you see how

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,079
much you are different but in so many

36
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,720
different ways the same little but in so

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
many different ways how similar enough

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,640
