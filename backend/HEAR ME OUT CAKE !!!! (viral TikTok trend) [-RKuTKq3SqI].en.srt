46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,280
a good idea cuz it's all we really can

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,680
do we're all hiding a bag look we need

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,479

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,880
we didn't have a cake so we're doing a

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,439
hear me out case of waters and we're

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
going to just stick it in the plastic

52
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,920
wait that's actually perfect right

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
there's nothing else that that's all we

54
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,840

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,319
I know and I know and I know that people

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,400
are going to say I I growing up growing

59
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,400
up being a public figure on the

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,680
internet my least favorite thing to do

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
if you haven't noticed in watching our

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,160

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,360
no difference between me and you my best

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,840
friends work normal jobs so I hate

68
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,599
talking about being a YouTuber cuz it's

69
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,959
glamorized and I feel normal but with

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,239
all that being said I in the past in the

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,000
p in the in recent times I feel like M

72
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,599
Matt and Chris have always

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,920
tried to maintain and this is a random

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,840
deep yeah this is we've always tried to

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,760
maintain our roots and our Aura of

76
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,720
Boston bonian triplets and I feel like

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll be the first to admit it I feel

78
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,000
like I've been corrupted a little bit by

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,000
like the life we live you know and I

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,319
feel like that's okay I feel like in the

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,760
past I've always been like I need to

82
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,000
steer away and like pretend that

83
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,680
nothing's changed because change is good

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,319
and this this and that but I do think

85
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,480
things have changed a little bit but me

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,599
and Mt Chris have learned so much about

87
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,799
oursel in the process and I think we're

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,360
back I feel and I'm okay with saying

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,120

widespread disease called scurvy which

397
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,040
is caused by a deficiency in vitamin C

Wardrobe that takes you to Narnia

484
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,919
absolutely right absolutely like you're

485
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,600
telling I just imagine the concept of

486
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,200
something like that that mythical like

487
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
we go oh we're going to go to my room

488
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,640
real quick and you're a Narnia beating

489
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,919
doy down and then you're back in it

490
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,480

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,520
same door I I I just don't think you can

495
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,159
close it I think you got to keep it open

496
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,880
but then that's that's bad you can't

497
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,480
leave a constant transmission of

498
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
teleportation through from one Earth to

499
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
the other we need more closets that you

500
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
can go in and like if if I was in the

501
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,400

it wasn't as Grand well that's not true

505
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,280
