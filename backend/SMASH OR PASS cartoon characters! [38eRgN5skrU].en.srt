218
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,040
I don't know what I think it's a crazy

219
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,959
concept I flipped off our kindergarten

220
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,580

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,959

223
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,060
used to like it was Kindergarten

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,100
and I didn't know what I want a piece of

225
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,540
ice Matt relax I didn't know what it

226
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,519
meant and they were like never stick up

227
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,040
your middle finger alone so I thought

228
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,600
that I'd like explode if I did it so I

229
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,519
put I was sitting crisscross applesauce

230
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,800
like this in kindergarten and I put my

231
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,240
hand like on like in my lap like this

232
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,040
and I did the middle finger at the

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,839
ground and I was like okay I'm safe like

234
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,060
it can't be that bad of a thing and they

235
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,560
were like we never do it like it's a bad

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,720
thing I'm like okay like it can't be

237
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,580
that bad and then I said

238
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,620
the do it to

239
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,720
um Miss so and so like it's if you if

240
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,220

like green like greenish blue lavender

388
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:15,360
almost the Grinch is the only green who

389
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:17,519
in the Grinch's Whoville spec now in

390
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,940
Horton here's a who we learned that the

391
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,240
speck lives on a truffle a tree correct

392
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,519
same universe right I think that the

393
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,399
Grinch was supposed to be or it's like a

394
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,260
Theory online that the Grinch was put on

395
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,600
the wrong Speck and he was supposed to

396
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,820
go to Whoville in Horton Hears a Who

397
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,220
because he would match the rest of the

398
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,680
who's there you know there's green who's

399
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,899
in Horton Hears a Who you just told me

400
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,360

the one with the Grinch with Cindy Lou

404
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,620

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,319
about the Grinch's perspective we

408
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,179
