the legs are cuz it's a real leg that's

105
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,439
so [ __ ] funny I really like the

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,479
inflatable costumes but you really can't

107
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,040
do much on like like are you going to

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,160
hard to tell come on like it's too

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
unrealistic to me like I like costumes

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,040
where you can still kind of see it's the

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,240
person I don't like when it's like

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,280
you're basically just like your bag of

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,680
it has to no no it has to it always has

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,320

I'm sick to my stomach dude I I feel bad

333
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:38,160
your dog is clearly blind in one

334
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,120
eye you're evil eyes are I'm laughing

335
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,440
cuz I you guys are evil people I can't

336
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,160
do this I'm laughing at the fact that

337
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,959
you sent a photo of the dog and then

338
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,959
also felt the need to send a photo of

339
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,160
the dog like choking like I feel ter

340
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:53,920
Nick that looks like a cough or a hack

341
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,480
or a throw up I wouldn't be surprised if

342
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,639
2 seconds after this throw up hit the

343
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,040
carpet you're evil Nick no no I think

344
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,320
that they took advantage of the dog's

345
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,600
age and dressed them no your dog's so

346
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,440
cute she's really cute and pretty and I

347
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,160
hope that she's having a good Halloween

and the glasses and the ears match but

356
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
like you're you're like picking your own

357
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,279
style like this is a great way to bring

358
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
yourself into a costume I think a little

359
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,720
face paint like three lines to really

360
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,440
like a pink nose but you're asking for

361
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,440
too much I feel no a pink nose would

362
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,920
have been great a little pink then like

363
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,120
they can like take the sunglasses off in

364
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,279

365
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,279
the whole point of Halloween for me

404
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,120
would be ruined if I was obstructed in

405
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,720
that you purchased an inconvenience

406
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,560
