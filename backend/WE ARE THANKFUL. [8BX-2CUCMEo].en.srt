502
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,400

504
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,200

506
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,559

507
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,559
life I need water I don't know I'm just

508
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm very thankful for having uh a

509
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,919
platform that we have that helps me

510
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,280
build the confidence and who I am

511
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,760
because I feel like there's a lot of

512
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,720
myself that like when we first started

513
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,720
doing this the opinions that we were

514
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,480
saying in these car videos were for us

515
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,240
to look back at what our opinions were

516
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
um 20 something years ago when we're

517
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,200
with our kids it wasn't for the internet

518
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,799
to understand and know our opinions and

519
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,880
and know our comedy and know who we are

520
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,799
as a person it just kind of happened and

521
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,799
it picked up in a crazy way so I think

522
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,360
the fact that us just doing and talking

523
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,080
about what we want to talk about for our

524
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,960
future being an outlet for people to

525
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,840
watch in their present day is just like

526
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,120
really crazy to me and like that it

527
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,880
blows my mind and I think the what I'm

528
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,120
most thankful for is just every single

529
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,280
project we take on whether it's podcast

530
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,480
whether it's tours we've done whether

531
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,960
it's car videos whether it's merch

532
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,880
whether it's your brand whether it's

533
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,400

534
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:55,360
amount of support and um Dedication that

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,440
people put towards us is just insane cuz

536
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,679
