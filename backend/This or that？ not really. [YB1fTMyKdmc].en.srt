36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
out of my own head but basically we

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
posted that this video was going to be a

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,640
this or that without having any idea

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,159
what this video is going to be we just

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,000
like the idea I have an actual question

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,960
though what are you guys doing if

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,040
Christmas carolers show up to the crib

43
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,399
knock on the door start singing Joy to

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,159
the World the slam the door right in

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,600
their face Matt didn't even say anything

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,520
he went he did slaming the door in their

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,799
[ __ ] mouth I feel like that's very

48
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,159
appropriate I agree to shut the door

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
well I feel like if someone's singing at

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,600
my doorstep I and what if I was busy see

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
there's a here here's what if I was like

52
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,759
What if I was watching a movie and then

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,039
I get interrupted by song an ad skip the

54
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,000
ad there's a couple things that shut the

55
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,600
door yeah there's a couple things that I

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,640
would do it's like virtual skipping the

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,000
ad

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
like it's not virtual that's real life

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,319
or real life IRL ad skip there's a

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
couple of things that I would do if I

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
wanted to listen to holiday music turn

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,480
it on turn on the radio put on the TV

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,040
put on YouTube watch a Christmas movie

64
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,879
getting a bunch of festive oldie through

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,239
your front door singing maybe even go to

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,720
a concert the second I got people with

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,080
scarfs with like the their open pamplet

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560

69
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,560
ridiculous get out of here I can't it's

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
just I just think of people with like

71
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,239
little kids or like dogs and it's like

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,599
if you're like like you're like watching

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,879
imagine like someone Rings your bell and

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,920
your dog like

75
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,760
nonstop oh my God imagine you put the

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,319
baby down for the for his first nap of

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
the day and they always I feel like they

78
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,720
always knock at night like it's like a

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,720
little late I want to wind up like a

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,200
punch like having a cartoon

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,800
like see I open the door say go away I I

82
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,319
th this pineapple juice right there

83
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,280
[ __ ] I'm just a massive fan of booby

84
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,799
traps like I just think I'm a net on my

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,319
they up they all get taken up in a net I

86
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,000
think put a springboard that you can

87
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,440
activate with a button so you open the

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,040
door and see that it's them I'm sorry

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,040
you open the door and see that it's them

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,680
and you grab the button and you go boom

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,319
and then they just launch away like from

92
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,519
your door or there's like a trap door

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,760
into the basement or they sink down and

94
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,760
they're stuck the video of the sing

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,599

98
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,159

99
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,840

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,040

and he opened it you couldn't put the

119
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,680
lid back on and that's why he drank the

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,720
whole thing I don't know why people like

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,960

156
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,160
[ __ ] I want to know what the [ __ ]

157
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,520
happened to guitar solos I agree

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,120
we need some more of those where did

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,880
they go that's a great guitar solos I

160
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,800
feel like if I went to if I went to

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,240
someone who's like 10 or younger and I

162
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,280
was like oh like have like and I asked

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,919
if they even knew what a guitar solo was

164
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,720
I feel like they wouldn't know and

165
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,800
that's something that concerns me I

166
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,960
agree like the little kids know about

167
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,520
guitar solos or no oh it makes me sick

168
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,520
that they everybody better know about

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,199
guitar I think that a guitar solo is I

170
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,759
want a guitar solo next time we go on

171
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,360

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,280
kind of like o this or that drum solo or

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,440

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,639
overall more solos I agree like get out

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,560

179
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,560
