00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,640
Hi Sharks. I'm Tim. And I'm Scott. We

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,040
are seeking $250,000

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,200
in exchange for 10% of our company,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,000
Paddle Smash.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,920
Pickle ball. It is the fastest growing

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,520
sport in North America. And if you're

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,560
not playing yet, you are definitely

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
missing out.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,520
Spikeball is a wildly popular outdoor

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,880
game.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,800
Now imagine if pickle ball and spikeball

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:34,399
went out for a nice romantic evening.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:38,239
Oh yeah. Ooh yeah, baby.

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:42,320
Things went great. And Smash, they made

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,960
a baby. That baby is Paddle Smash. We've

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
combined the best elements of both into

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,760
the ultimate outdoor game. Take a look

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,719
at this video.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,440
Paddle Smash is played two versus two.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,680
Teammates work together to bump, set,

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,160
and smash the ball into the court and

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,079
over the net. It's then the opposing

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,080
team's job to do the same.

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,840
Games are played to 11 points, so

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,400
they're quick, fun, and full of energy.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,400
Paddle Smash is portable. Think Pickle

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Ball to Go. It can be set up and taken

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,760
down in minutes.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,680
So, which one of you sharks wants to

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,759
bump, set, and smash a deal with us?

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
What is the average age of who plays it?

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm picturing young guys.

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Yeah, we we say it's best for families

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,840
with kids over the age of 13. So, it's a

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
little hard to kind of come in. There's

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,640
some hand eye coordination involved. So,

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,439
older kids, teenagers, families looking

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
to play together.

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,439
So, you you guys know Spikeball came on

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
Shark Tank, right? People always ask me,

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,840
"What's the one deal I missed?"

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
It was Spike Ball. And that's blown up.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
Yeah, it's blown up huge.

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,240
All right. So tell us about you and how

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
did you come up with this?

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
So we're not the inventors of Paddle

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,799
Smash. The story really starts with Joe

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,360
Bingham who is the inventor and Joe has

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
seven kids. He's a structural engineer.

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
He said to himself, "Can I create a game

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
that brings pickle ball into our

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,880
backyard and he created Paddle Smash? He

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
tinkered in his garage, glued a bunch of

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
stuff together, and made Paddle Smash."

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
He started playing this with friends and

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,000
family just at parties and over two

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,280
years refined it, but he didn't know

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,440
what to do with it. And that's actually

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
where Tim and I come into the story. So

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,840
Scott and I have a combined 25 years of

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
experience in the toying game industry.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Uh Scott had co-founded a chain of

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,520
retail stores and I co-founded a a board

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,480
game company and Scott was the first

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
retailer to pick up my game and both of

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,120
us ended up selling our businesses to

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
other big toy game companies and we

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
vowed to work together. We got along

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,920
well and Scott's a huge pickleball

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
player. So it was just kind of

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800
fortuitous that we were introduced to

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,319
the inventor Joe. Shortly after we

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
having these conversations about what we

74
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
wanted to work on together and we saw

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
it, we brought it to pickleball course,

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
play tested it with pigball players.

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
They got it immediately and we were

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
like, "This is it. Let's do it. Let's

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
bring it."

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,720
Did you buy the rights or the IP?

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,200
We intellectual property.

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
So Joe gets a royalty for it, but

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
yeah, he gets the royalty. I know you

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
like that word.

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
Stealing one out of here.

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,879
Yeah, he beat you to it.

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,480
How much does it cost you to make? And

88
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000
how much are you selling it for?

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,400
The retail is $200.

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
Wow.

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
What's it cost you to make?

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,519
$55.

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
Okay. Landed.

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
Does that include the royalty back to

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,080
Joe?

96
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
It doesn't. So it' be slightly more than

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,959
that. Joe gets a 5% royalty.

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
5% of

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
net sales of net. Wow.

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,000
What involvement is Joe? Or is he just

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,239
silent and he just gets his royalty?

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
Joe gets fun update calls.

103
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
Fun update calls

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,560
and then he gets a quarterly royalty

105
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,720
check and he's always excited. It comes

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
with four paddles, two balls, the net

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
system, and the base. The base folds in

108
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,879
half and becomes the case for the game.

109
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,400
Oh, really? That's quite easy.

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,440
This is the base.

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
That's very smart.

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
Have you sold any?

113
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
Have we sold any? That's a good

114
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
question.

115
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
What are your sales?

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,799
Uhoh.

117
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,120
Uhoh.

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,000
Is that a good or a bad?

119
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
You'll tell me.

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,040
Okay. So, we're 9 months old and we're

121
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,159
barely out of the womb. We

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
have sold to date $700,000 worth of

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,000
product.

124
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,519
That's really good.

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Yeah. 700,000.

126
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
Have you made any money on it?

127
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
We're break even right now.

128
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,840
Good for you.

129
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,280
Okay.

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
How are you selling this?

131
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,160
So, we started out as a direct to

132
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,880
consumer. Have a e-commerce store. Um,

133
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,199
as like a flyer, we sent some cold

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,800
emails and like LinkedIn messages to

135
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,320
buyers at Dick Sporting Goods, Shields,

136
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
Academy Sports. They're the three

137
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
largest sporting goods retailers in the

138
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
country. Um much to our surprise, they

139
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,479
all got back to us and they all said

140
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
yes. So, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop

141
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
right there. Stop right there.

142
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,919
Wow.

143
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
So many people come on and say, "Oh, I

144
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
need a shark to go connect with

145
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
everybody." Right. You just sent a cold

146
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
LinkedIn email.

147
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,880
They like your pickle is hot,

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
right? They're looking for any angle.

149
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Anything pickleball related, they are

150
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
snatching up.

151
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,400
So, what do you need the 250 for?

152
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Yeah. So, I think for a couple things.

153
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
One would definitely be inventory. Um

154
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,919
the other is just all these

155
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,919
opportunities for growth. We have dialed

156
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,720
in what marketing works best and we

157
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
think we know

158
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
which is what

159
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,080
time to turn on the engines. So social

160
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,000
media marketing is the sweet spot for us

161
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,400
guys. I like it. I'll make you an offer.

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,120
It's a very simple idea and it works.

163
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
250,000 I want 20%.

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
We appreciate that offer.

165
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,039
Yeah. Thank you.

166
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,440
I think it's a great offer.

167
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
So Mark and I own a pickle ball team.

168
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
Yes, we do.

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
I like it. I mean, I think this is this

170
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
whole thing is blowing up. As you guys

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
know, pickle ball is huge. And Mark, are

172
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
you interested in doing this?

173
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,479
Sure, we can do it together.

174
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
Yeah. Uh 250,000. What do you think,

175
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,680
Mark?

176
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
I mean, 20% is probably about right to

177
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
get two of us.

178
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,039
Wow. He's so generous today. I was going

179
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,000
to ask for 25, but yeah, I'll do it for

180
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,120
20%. 250,000. 20% Mark and I.

181
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,280
You won't get Mr. Wonderful there.

182
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
Uh, would you be doing would you be

183
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,120
willing to do um

184
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
No, no.

185
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
No. No. Seriously?

186
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
Yeah. I mean, um, so would you want to

187
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,960
do 500,000 for the 20%.

188
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,280
No. I tremendous amount of value. We're

189
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,759
in this game. We own a pickle ball team.

190
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,560
I mean, you want the two of us on this.

191
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,080
I'll go to 15% just to squeeze heads.

192
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
You don't want a guy like Kevin on this

193
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,840
deal.

194
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
Yeah. You guys got to make a decision.

195
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
And I understand. And look, if you don't

196
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,919
want to do it, that's fine, too.

197
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,120
One thing is we're not paying ourselves

198
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,039
anything.

199
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,960
We have it all in. The equity is the

200
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,280
only thing we get. That's your uprise,

201
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
right?

202
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,319
You just got to decide.

203
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Would you match Mr. Wonderful's offer of

204
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
15%.

205
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,240
No. No.

206
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,639
Can we chat for a second?

207
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

208
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,600
Make it fast.

209
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll have this. Could I have this

210
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,039
paddle?

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah. Use your paddle.

212
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
What do you want to do?

213
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,919
I don't know what you want to do.

214
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,919
It's a lot.

215
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay.

216
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,919
All right. Well, thank you for all the

217
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
offers.

218
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
We want to take one more swing at you

219
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
two.

220
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,720
We would love to work with you, but we

221
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,039
really are looking for $250,000 for 15%

222
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,039
of the business.

223
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,520
No.

224
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,240
Didn't Kevin offer you 15%.

225
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
He did.

226
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
Well, there is Kevin.

227
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
Yeah, but he's not the right partner.

228
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
These guys are.

229
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,160
That's interesting, Barbara. But you

230
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
don't have an offer at all. I'm not

231
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
interested. Don't tell me.

232
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Guys, look. Obviously, you don't want to

233
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,440
do it. Guys, look. Obviously, what do

234
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,440
you think?

235
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,720
Okay. We have a deal. Seal

236
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
decision.

237
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
We have a deal.

238
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
Wow. Are you sure?

239
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
Yeah.

240
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,639
Thank you.

241
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,199
Appreciate it, guys.

242
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
All right. Thank you.

243
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
Thank you, guys.

244
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Did we just do it, Tim?

245
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
We walk out with a little bit of this.

246
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,199
Woo!

247
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
Yeah.
