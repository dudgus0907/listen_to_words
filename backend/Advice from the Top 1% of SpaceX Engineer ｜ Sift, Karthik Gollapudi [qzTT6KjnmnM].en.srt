1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,879
for people just starting their career I

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,919
have a bit of a different advice I think

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,720
a lot of people say go start your own

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,160
company learn by doing I highly don't

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,040
recommend that route I would recommend

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,360
most people they actually go see what

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,639
good looks like and that doesn't

8
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,000
necessarily part where I talk about

9
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,360
Prestige is that like just because

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,400
something prestigious doesn't mean the

11
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,720
right place that you're going to learn

12
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,439
the most from the thing that might have

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,039
made that procedure might no longer

14
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,640
still be relevant because of people who

15
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,880
were there that got it that state might

16
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,279
not be as involved it might be a much

17
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,400
larger company might be a lot more

18
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,039
process it's very much about I would say

19
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
go look for the smartest people you can

20
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,800
surround yourself with and try to work

21
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,239
there and just do like little flavor one

22
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,520
year at a multiple companies like you

23
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,920
really want to understand something from

24
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,480
first principles which really requires

25
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
spending multiple years trying to work

26
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,800
through some hard problem you definitely

27
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,640
want to try to look for places have

28
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,840
already had some level of success and

29
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,239
you're going to continue to build on

30
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,559
level of success the reason I call that

31
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,960
out is because there's some pretty

32
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,399
interesting companies with smart people

33
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,079
that seem smart from the outside as a

34
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,160
22y old or when you're young it's hard

35
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,079
to evaluate like what is smart or not

36
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,359
smart because everyone smarter than you

37
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
hi I'm Kake I'm the CEO at sift at sift

38
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,719
we're building the data tools to go

39
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
build modern machines and a lot of it is

40
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,720
inspired by workflows and processes and

41
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,400
how we built machines back at SpaceX

42
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,799
where I spent the prior 4 and a half

43
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,520
years before working on the dragon

44
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
flight software program and dragon was a

45
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,960
capsule that carried astronauts and

46
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,720
cargo to the space station so we have uh

47
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,960
seven publicly announced customers we

48
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,240
raised about 25 million most recently

49
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,560
the series a was led by GV Plus Google

50
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,840
Ventures previous rced was led by two

51
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,159
firms in LA CA Ventures focuses on a lot

52
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,560
of Enterprise SAS Riot Venture is one of

53
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,560
the best like Hardware investing firms

54
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,240
I was born and raised in a little suburb

55
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,479
outside of LA right next to JPL so I was

56
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,520
about 10 15 minutes outside of JPL so I

57
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
actually grew up going to Industry days

58
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,000
where you can just walk in there's a lot

59
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
of photos of me actually with like

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,280
playing with the Mars rover and the

61
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,640
Legos and stuff that they had at JPL I

62
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,399
would always grew up with Legos but then

63
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,280
like my first real like machines were

64
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,040
LEGO Mindstorms you can build all robots

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
and you can make very simple programs

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,439
with these Legos I started that around 9

67
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
so I was like fourth grade always had

68
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,560
fun with that with my friends and I also

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,920
this thing called first Lego league so

70
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,719
first robotics they have these

71
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,960
competitions it's most known for the

72
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,240
high schoolers that are building like

73
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,599
these robots they'll have like they'll

74
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,080
be like three on three and they'll have

75
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,480
some sort of like theme saying like Hey

76
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,760
we're building a moon base so you have

77
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,599
to build a robot that can go drive

78
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,160
around on a slick floor the floor will

79
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,440
be all whiteboard material and the

80
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,920
wheels you have to use are basically

81
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,519
like a whiteboard material so it's like

82
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,080
super slippery and we all have some sort

83
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,400
of competition we to like move these

84
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,160
massive balls into a net whatever it is

85
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,480
but they also have younger levels it's

86
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
Lego based so that was kind of my

87
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,720
background I was like around engineering

88
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
but it wasn't like a hardcore

89
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
engineering like stem background it's

90
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
like I had the exposure but I had a lot

91
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,879
of freedom to do other things there's a

92
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
little bit more Nuance I knew that the

93
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,280
whole like PayPal Mafia so basically

94
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
during undergrad that's when Peter teal

95
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,040
came out with 0 to1 so that book 0 to1 I

96
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
liked it a lot kind of more contrarian

97
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,159
very much promoting first principles

98
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,200
thinking of that I was looking at more

99
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,599
of like the PayPal Mafia companies but

100
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,959
PayPal was also like much later stage I

101
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,040
I didn't think it was the PayPal in the

102
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,720
early days but a lot of these other

103
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,200
companies like paler SpaceX Tesla were

104
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,599
really interesting so that's what I was

105
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
looking at as opposed to like the

106
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
prestigious companies I actually would

107
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,879
as part of advice I would highly

108
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
recommend people not optimizing for

109
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,200
Prestige do you know the atmology of the

110
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,879
word Prestige the atmology of the word

111
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
Prestige is actually it goes back to

112
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,840
like the French word for illusion and

113
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,480
then it goes back to the Latin word for

114
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,959
playing tricks Conjuring tricks the

115
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,239
whole concept like Prestige and a

116
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,799
prestigious Place actually a bit of an

117
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,360
illusion you just want to go to places

118
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,799
that are like have results like can like

119
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,239
see people say it's great but you can

120
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,159
actually see with your own eyes on the

121
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,159
ground truth with space xile was clearly

122
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,159
visible

123
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,280
are you a tech startup founder building

124
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,959
something cool if so listen up EO has

extension to get it tells the world your

137
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,680
website is all about technology and hey

138
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,159
it's cooler.com some of the coolest Tech

139
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,439
startups are already using te domains

140
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,239
and we've been highlighting their

141
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,360
stories in eo's original interview

142
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,720
series Beyond Tech now it's your turn

143
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,040
head over to www. pitch. or check the

144
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,040
video description to apply

145
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,960
now I joined space act there is a lot of

146
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,039
stuff to learn one of the Dragon

147
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,919
missions as is coming back to Earth the

148
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,520
Dragon capsule has four parachutes one

149
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,039
of the four parachutes it didn't open

150
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
until a pretty low altitude of course

151
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,759
there's redundancy built in it was

152
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,320
always going to be safe even though that

153
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,960
parachute didn't open it wasn't an

154
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,639
expected Behavior and the way that this

155
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,039
works is these Dragon missions work on a

156
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,400
scheduling is as soon as you bring these

157
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,120
four astronauts back you want to launch

158
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
another four immediately to get back on

159
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,160
a space station our scheduled next

160
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,759
launch was actually just one week behind

161
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,440
but then NASA said hey this parachute

162
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,280
didn't open how do we know this is not

163
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,720
going to be a more problematic issue on

164
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,680
the next mission and then they grounded

165
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,440
the next flight until this result for us

166
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,919
to actually figure out what was

167
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
happening we need to see all the data

168
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,080
that was collected from the vehicle but

169
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
it's stored on this like black box on

170
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,800
the vehicle just like I was an airplane

171
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,039
has like this black box that stores all

172
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,759
the data and the thing is that this

173
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,039
capsule it lands in the Gulf of Mexico

174
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,919
you don't have internet connection in

175
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,759
the Gulf of Mexico to go debug this so

176
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,639
at that time starlink was like a very

177
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
experimental program so we like shot

178
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,400
over and email the Starling team and

179
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,600
we're like hey is there any way we can

180
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
get internet over the Gulf of Mexico

181
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,039
they activated some cells over the Gulf

182
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
of Mexico upload this data from the

183
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,319
Dragon capsule while it was sailing this

184
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,800
is before like Starling was a thing so

185
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,280
like getting High through put internet

186
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,840
in middle of the ocean is not heard of

187
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,160
we're able to send all the data back to

188
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,440
the headquarters we able to run it

189
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,080
through the whole testing Suite do all

190
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
the analysis basically say that the next

191
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,759
mission is good to go it's very

192
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,199
interesting you have very smart people

193
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,000
that are basically able to coordinate

194
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,120
satellites to beam internet when it was

195
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,880
a very experimental program to go

196
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,280
accelerate your physical spacecraft

197
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,840
company at the time so I think that was

198
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
just like a very cool experience I think

199
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,919
the biggest things I learned was just

200
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
seeing what good looks like which I know

201
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,800
is like very broad because I I actually

202
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,639
noce you were asking the question

203
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,199
earlier about what advice would you give

204
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,960
and I think one of the things is just

205
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,520
learning from the smartest folks and at

206
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
SpaceX I just saw a lot of people that

207
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
were operating a very high level and

208
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,599
sure you can criticize that like maybe

209
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,319
certain things like management might not

210
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,680
be what everyone else likes but at the

211
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,919
end of the day you see it with your eyes

212
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,440
it's like the largest rocket ever

213
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,960
launched and brought back in landing

214
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,639
until you you can like push the boundary

215
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
and like show people things that have

216
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,080
never been possible and you're like

217
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,520
super proud of the work you do you work

218
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
really really hard but then you can look

219
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,840
back and you're super proud of what you

220
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,800
do I think the key learning was just how

221
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,360
to operate at that very high level the

222
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
things that stood out of operating that

223
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,639
high level La is just urgency so it's

224
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,599
just like high urgency High iteration

225
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,319
rate you learn the most if you just have

226
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,560
that urgency to move faster it was

227
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,800
mostly I just wanted to see what good

228
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,000
look like so I was interview on

229
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,919
companies I thought were really high

230
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,840
performing at that time this is what

231
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,120
2017 is when I decided to join SpaceX I

232
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
was just pretty much looking for

233
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,440
learning from very very high performing

234
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,319
companies because I knew eventually I'd

235
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,039
either be running a company or starting

236
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,720
company or be in a high leadership

237
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,000
position let me go see how it was done

238
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,160
by the best so I was interviewing

239
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,759
companies I thought were very very high

240
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
performing at that time stripe was one

241
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,240
of the hot companies at that time was

242
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,520
like really interesting at the time I

243
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,280
just wanted to learn from people who

244
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,919
were doing well what stood about SpaceX

245
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,360
like the interview process was just very

246
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,960
different than every other company

247
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,199
nobody was pitching me on benefits no

248
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,759
one was pitching me on like work life

249
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,160
balance they were pitching me on Mission

250
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,879
and the work that you're doing here

251
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,759
there's a lot more Spartan but it's also

252
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,240
something you can look back on and be

253
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,759
very excited about and you can like

254
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
point to something great that you

255
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
accomplished with another team that was

256
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,479
grinding very hard that was the main

257
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,120
reason why I chose it so while I was

258
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,840
there I learned a lot about how to build

259
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,840
machines that are safer more reliable

260
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,800
fall tolerant I wanted to bring a lot of

261
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,560
those ideas and practices The Wider

262
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,240
industry of people building machines

263
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,680
that's why we actually started sift to

264
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,199
productize some of this knowledge into

265
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,160
tools for the rest of the hardware

266
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,639
industry I see Sith growing in like the

267
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
vision that I would have for it or my

268
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,120
goal I want a percentage of the physical

269
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,319
world to be operating on Sith I want at

270
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,520
least a percent of the trains the planes

271
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,120
the automobiles the drones the aircraft

272
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
things that are out there I want those

273
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,159
operating on sift whether they're being

274
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,960
designed whether they're being

275
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,280
manufactured if they're out in the field

276
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,840
they're generating data they need to be

277
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
maintained there should be at least

278
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,720
percentage of the physical world running

279
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
on

280
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,520
CFT process for acquiring cft's first

281
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,240
customer was actually kind of Novel we

282
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,879
actually just rented space parallel

283
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
systems's office they're the autonomous

284
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,960
rail company they were our first

285
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,280
customer they have a pretty cool office

286
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,639
and we literally just asked them if we

287
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,680
can rent one of the rooms as we build

288
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,440
out the product and that was just

289
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,400
motivated by at SpaceX Elon always

290
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,840
wanted the engineer on the factory floor

291
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,479
so we said we should just be embedded

292
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,919
with our customers let's go rent a room

293
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,360
and then as we built the product we had

294
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,319
new features we just go grab someone

295
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,560
else in the office and say what do you

296
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,279
think of this what do you want what do

297
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,959
you not like our early road map was

298
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,000
completely driven by them the evolution

299
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,560
of our sales motion to the next first

300
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
few customers it was a lot of it was

301
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,159
like using things in network we were

302
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,560
lucky that there's vibrant SpaceX Alum

303
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,519
Community we also were able to reach out

304
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,959
through existing investors our investors

305
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,600
that were generally interested in Sith

306
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,040
uh for introductions and also just even

307
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,519
just reaching out on LinkedIn talking

308
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,120
about this stuff that we so what we

309
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,839
wanted to do showing the product but

310
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,120
then also we had a competitor started

311
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,440
around the same time as us we actually

312
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,279
had a few of those bake offs in the

313
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,519
early days the other companies knew that

314
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,880
there's final customers do with their

315
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,160
multiple companies in the space invited

316
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,800
us to a bake off because it definitely

317
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
added a lot of urgency on our team and

318
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,760
we won all the bake offs that we've done

319
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
to date that was actually a bit of a

320
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,800
novel experience I would say compared to

321
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,000
most companies I think some of the

322
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,240
biggest lessons I've learned is that

323
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,720
like it really all just comes down to

324
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
people you have one life to live like

325
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,560
spend it with the people you want to be

326
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,200
around there's a lot of urgency I have

327
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,959
very very limited time if I'm going to

328
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,440
go spend my time with someone I want to

329
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,320
be the best person I can spend that time

330
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440
with and that goes into everything

331
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,720
whether that's work whether that's

332
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,079
personal so choosing the best partner or

333
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,440
that everything that you do is just

334
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,600
inform other people that are into that

335
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,880
the end of the day like CFT you can talk

336
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,040
about all this Tech you can talk talk

337
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,760
about this architecture you can talk

338
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
about all this cool stuff that we do

339
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,920
even our backgrounds or whatever but it

340
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,560
really just comes down to people without

341
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,240
the people we have at sift we wouldn't

342
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,839
have the company to sift make sure you

343
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,240
bring together the best team create

344
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,000
opportunities for everyone to grow keep

345
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,640
everyone happy to be there that's the

346
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,640
main lesson I

347
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,920
learned and that's actually a big thing

348
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
I would call out because a lot of the

349
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,680
audience here probably it looks cool to

350
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,120
get some person that's like oh the CEO

351
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,760
or that person who it's like a really

352
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,000
high profile sounds really you just get

353
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
them as advisors but if they're not

354
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,480
invested in your success significantly

355
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,320
they're not going to be actually helping

356
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,600
you they're not going to be doing

357
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,760
interviews they're not going to help you

358
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,279
on the trenches and you need to get

359
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
people who are going to do that and in

360
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,360
that process they're going to challenge

361
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,760
you and get the smartest folks around so

362
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,240
the best way to evaluate what is a good

363
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,640
team or smart team honestly is just a

364
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,079
kiss a lot of frogs maintaining that

365
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Talent bar and looking for people who

366
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,040
want to do something challenging that

367
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,760
they can be proud of they're going to

368
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
work hard and they can think around like

369
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,720
the same level or smarter than you even

370
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
better for people just starting the

371
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,360
career I have a bit of a different

372
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,079
advice I think a lot of people say go

373
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,519
start your own company learn by doing I

374
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,640
highly don't recommend that route I

375
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,920
would recommend most people they

376
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
actually go see what good looks like and

377
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,800
that doesn't necessarily part where I

378
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,000
talk about Prestige is that like just

379
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,560
because something's procedes doesn't

380
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,839
mean that it's like the right place that

381
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,760
you're going to learn the most from the

382
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,560
thing that might have made that

383
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,920
procedure might no longer still be

384
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,320
relevant because the people who were

385
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,560
there that got it to that state might

386
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,959
not be as involved it might be a much

387
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
larger company might be a lot more

388
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,720
process it's very much about I would say

389
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,200
go look for the smartest people you can

390
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,680
surround yourself with and try to work

391
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,680
there and don't just do like little

392
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,839
flavor one year at multiple companies

393
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,079
like you really want understand

394
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,720
something from first principles which

395
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,320
really requires spending multiple years

396
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
TR to work through some hard problems

397
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
you definitely want to try to look for

398
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,200
places have already had some level of

399
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,639
success and you're going to continue to

400
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
build on a level of success the reason I

401
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,480
call that out is because there's some

402
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,839
pretty interesting companies but smart

403
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,560
people that seem smart from the outside

404
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,519
and as a 22y old or when you're young

405
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,120
it's hard to evaluate like what is smart

406
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,160
or not smart because everyone's smarter

407
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,240
than you you want to be careful to not

408
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,880
go somewhere spend a decade and if that

409
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,680
company shuts down you don't know what

410
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,079
that company did that was successful or

411
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,480
not successful that's why it's good to

412
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,920
go to place has like some level of

413
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,519
success that has momentum and it's

414
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,000
continuing to grow so like SpaceX was

415
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,320
really awesome in that regard they were

416
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,480
actually around the time I landed was

417
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,000
the first time the Falcon heavy was

418
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,360
launched they already had rocket Falcon

419
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
9 rockets that were launching they

420
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,360
already had the Dragon 1 program but

421
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,639
there's still a lot more they were

422
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,160
planning on doing they weren't just like

423
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,000
sitting and resting that's what I would

424
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,240
optimize for the reason I call out the

425
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
prestige is like I would completely

426
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,959
remove the prestige like if you really

427
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,000
want to do that go do that the reason I

428
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,560
call that out is because a lot of times

429
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,760
people will go into that career purely

430
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
for the sake of that saying like it

431
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,000
looks cool you can go tell your aunts

432
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
about it but are you going to learn as

433
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,279
much are you doing like hard skills are

434
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
you actually working on the problem are

435
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,680
you completely abstracted away are you

436
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
just multiplying the Grump work that's

437
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,399
being done so like are you actually

438
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
going to ownership of things or are you

439
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,240
just like being the grunt work

440
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,199
multiplier for someone else that's more

441
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,000
senior so the reason I recommend people

442
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,440
to join a company doing something hard

443
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,560
and like seeing what great looks like

444
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,519
it's very difficult to strive for

445
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,000
greatness if you've never seen what

446
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,480
greatness looks like cool you can go

447
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
watch as many podcasts as you want you

448
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,560
can go see what some blog posts but it's

449
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,279
kind of like Instagram right you only

450
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,120
see the best of someone's life you only

451
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,880
see like a very curated version that's

452
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,760
in like a blog post but what were the

453
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,720
decisions that got the company to that

454
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,480
place what were the nine failures they

455
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,320
had for that one success that's what you

456
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,880
learn by actually solving hard problems

457
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,760
and you don't get that by spending one

458
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,199
two years at like six companies and then

459
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,639
saying I'm going to do an MBA and then

460
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,160
go start company for example and you

461
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,880
just really have to work deeply on a

462
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,120
hard problem with smart folk and a hard

463
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,279
Problem by the way can be different

464
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,680
problems like you don't necessarily have

465
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,160
to go build Rockets even just like

466
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,519
growing like a software startup there's

467
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,240
a lot of challenges in building that

468
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,519
company honestly like I don't think it's

469
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,120
a complete reflection on the other

470
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,560
person not being smart I think just

471
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,040
what's the right role for the person

472
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,480
like for somebody join your company it's

473
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,680
like it's a pretty big risk it might be

474
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,279
very different than somewhere else that

475
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,680
they've been very successful at someone

476
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,199
who might have been very very successful

477
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,800
like a sales force they might struggle

478
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,079
in a much earlier stage role like I

479
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,920
wouldn't hold it against them it's just

480
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,600
a process like don't feel as bad about

481
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,320
it everyone does it everyone struggles

482
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,680
everyone finds it hard but as you're

483
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,600
talking about iteration rate you want to

484
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,160
kiss more frogs you'll see what's good

485
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,480
what's not a lot faster than sitting

486
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,480
there trying to grind through a bad

487
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,680
decision the best things I learned while

488
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,279
working at SpaceX very very strong focus

489
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,040
on first principles thinking you can

490
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,880
just keep asking why a lot of times

491
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,519
people push something off and they say

492
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,000
oh well we're waiting for this person

493
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,519
before we have that meeting is something

494
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,519
scheduled for 2 weeks from now it's like

495
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,920
why does that person even have to be in

496
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,360
the meeting what can we go around and

497
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,040
still move let's say something's not

498
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,320
working instead of just saying like oh

499
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,600
that's not working because it's just

500
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,959
broken or it's like a thing that you

501
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,720
can't do like people say you can't land

502
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,600
Rockets like why why can't you land

503
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,120
rocket we fly and land planes all the

504
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,480
time people like oh because of this or

505
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,880
this technical reason and it's like well

506
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,639
not actually blocked by physics it's

507
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,360
just that nobody's ever done it before

508
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,240
basically you keep asking why till the

509
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,680
point physics is the reason you can't do

510
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,120
it I think that's what I would consider

511
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,480
first principles but it applies

512
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,199
everywhere it's like I think a lot of

513
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,720
times we have a tendency to just say oh

514
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,120
the hardware team says we can't do this

515
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,279
it's like well who on the hardware team

516
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,759
and you go talk to that person you

517
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,959
realize they actually can do it but it's

518
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,600
just like some other thing that they

519
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,839
also need and if you as long as you get

520
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,560
that then you can actually get this

521
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,320
thing a lot faster there's actually this

522
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,880
plays into a lot of like Risk as well

523
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,440
Warner Von Bron who used to run NASA

524
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,720
back in the during the Apollo era he

525
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,160
noticed that let's say some engineer

526
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,560
identified a risk and then they told

527
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,920
manager about it the manager would

528
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,480
downplay that risk it would go from

529
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,680
saying oh this is fatal when you stop

530
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,199
the mission to the manager saying hey

531
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,120
this is a really high risk that person's

532
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,839
manager says oh we need to go look into

533
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,440
this by the time it reaches Warner Von

534
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,000
Brun he would actually just basically

535
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,639
someone would says oh everything's good

536
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,160
to go he actually implemented this thing

537
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
called like weekly notes so what he

538
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,720
would do is he had every individual

539
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,199
engineering squad or team write notes

540
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,680
and his team would compile them into a

541
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,320
book and he would actually review all

542
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,800
them so he basically sees ground truth

543
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
and he can actually make decisions from

544
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,440
first principles about what's holding of

545
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,160
the program and basically that's how we

546
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
put a person on the moon those Rockets

547
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,600
probably have the compute power of like

548
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,079
