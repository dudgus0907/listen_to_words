00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,160
chain because I hit him in the face of

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,399
the pillow and we got into a big fight

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,140
boring heard it the day that that

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,300
happened I switched from that chain

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,180
because it broke to this horse one so

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,060
I've seen my my mom multiple times with

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,880
this I wouldn't say multiple I'd say the

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,840
last two trips okay she goes up to Matt

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,760
and goes you wanna know what it reminds

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,200
me up and it's a horse so we're all

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,360
expecting something like a beautiful

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,159
story like a spirit free in the wind

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,420
like jumping in correct we were

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,640
attracting something wholesome and sweet

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,340
and she said PF Chang's the restaurant

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,200
it shows PF Chang's in Boston and we're

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,900
like What like where's the food place

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,000
and she's like P.F Chang's because the

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,200
horse out front and I Googled it and I'm

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,060
gonna put a photo on the screen right

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,939
now but this is what the horse looks

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,619
like outside of P.F Chang's in Boston is

40
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,220
it it's just like a massive horse

41
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,220
sculpture

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,040
it's funny because it has nothing to do

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,560
with PFA it looks like every other horse

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,560
on Earth ever but to Mom it just really

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,780
sat with us friends it's so funny

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,000
because it's that horse has nothing to

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,860
do with the PF Changs being in the

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
background that's just what it does

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,020
that's just no it's just there it's not

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,520
PF

51
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,640
Chang's and figure yes I don't know if

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,459
that's like P.F Changs search up right

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,319
now search up right now is is the horse

54
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,420
normal at PF Changs because I think it's

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,180
a boss as opposed to why like do you

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,340
think like that Matt's just saying every

57
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,319
PF Chang's doesn't have a beautiful no

58
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,239
I'm saying if that's not North Shore

59
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,340
malls there's a horse outside the PF

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,660
Chang oh so it might be a PF Chang's

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,580
like this is that PF Chang's thing

62
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,720
because in my head that building can get

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,340
knocked down and you can put a Burger

64
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,340
King with a PF Changs that means

65
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't I don't what's up with this fire

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,000
there's got to be something happening

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,519
right dead over there right around that

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,319
corner there's something bad going on oh

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,660
no there's a there's a horse outside of

70
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,700
many PF Changs oh I stand corrected so

71
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,440
shout out mom she figured it out yep

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,440

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,019

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,959

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,780
that she was like this Brazilian lady oh

155
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,220
no it was it was woman the woman who cut

156
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,560
my hair there like

157
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,699
I try to be like I'm all for women I

158
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,380
love them

159
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,000
this woman

160
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,280
had

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,139
breast implants for sure not that this

162
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,460
is like a bad thing it's just critical

163
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,960
to the stories that's why I'm bringing

164
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,460
it up but usually I wouldn't talk about

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,479
a woman's breasts but it has to go with

166
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,520
the story so I have to bring it up but

167
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,280
because she had breast implants her

168
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,860
boobs were obviously huge so she was

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,960
cutting my hair she was cutting my hair

170
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,639
and as she was cutting my hair she was

171
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,919
getting so close to me while cutting my

172
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,960
hair that like her boobs were like

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,759
resting on my neck and back and

174
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,979
shoulders and head and like she just

175
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,440
kept going around me cutting parts of my

176
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,800
hair and I'm just like I'm happy I was

177
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,080
like gay because otherwise like like I

178
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,759
was just scared because I'm like if I

179
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,860
was anyone else I'd feel very violated

180
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,660
like I was very comfortable but her

181
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,400
boobs were everywhere around me like my

182
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,539
back my shoulder if you're if you're too

183
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,819

339
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,940

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,380
how much money is in an ATM for you to

341
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,200
really want to like steal not that much

342
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,760
it's not like minimum or Max like 10K in

343
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,860
an ATM

344
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,579
I'm thinking last something like six

345
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,079
thousand what is the average ATM money

346
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,760

347
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,380
steal it nothing Nick what do they what

348
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,240

354
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,480

355
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,339
thousand you you so you said

356
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,800

ten thousand I should maximum 10K I

358
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,399
literally said exactly what Google just

359
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,100

360
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,040
10K to rob an ATM it's like I mean I

361
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,660

get it for free you didn't have to work

366
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,500
but like what you shouldn't do it I

367
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,940
agree it got me one would be crazy if

368
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,100
you steal it and then you're bail to be

369
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,560
bailed that was like 4K you know one of

370
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,079
them are still in the price no you're

371
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,880
not they take the money back you know

372
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,920
like you know like money heists you're

373
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,899
actually dumb as for that that's

374
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,639
like money Heist and like that like

375
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,500
banks with like the big safes and all

376
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,180
that there's no way like every

377
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,760
single bit what was that maneuver there

378
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:09,120
like the crank of the Vault okay just

379
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,800
wanted to make sure it for me it's like

380
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
I really thought about this like you

381
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,399
know how like in oh in um The Dark Night

382
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,600
like the opening scene where they're

383
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,660
like getting all the money and the

384
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,220
duffel bags and all that stuff

385
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,620
yes you know what I mean there's no way

386
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,260
every single Bank in the world has like

387
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,839
those like giant racks it's just money

388
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,639
all over it I mean there's definitely

389
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,740
you know banks have very minimal money

390
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,060
nowadays because of the lack of cash in

391
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,880
the world most people are using their

392
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,959
cards

393
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,240
the other day and they didn't accept

394
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,060
cash oh yeah like you but like if I had

395
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,620
a thousand dollars in my hand or like 2

396
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,699
000 in the bank I would Flex the

397
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,440
Thousand because it's just like there

398
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,579
yeah like you're holding it like oh a

399
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,940
thousand dollars then two thousands like

400
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,940
oh cool

401
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,160
when money's in your hand it feels like

402
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,240
you have way more you know what I mean

403
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,100
so just everything it's about

404
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,920
perspective that's how the life it is

405
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,560
about perspective but like I don't know

406
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,440
I feel like 10K is not worth I feel bad

407
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,699
though because I never have cash anymore

408
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,959
and this guy asked me for money the

409
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,339
other day it's homeless duties like can

410
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,019
I have a dollar I was like I got you on

411
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,760
the way out like I don't have cash on me

412
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,040
right now and I went in and like I was

413
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,440
like oh I still I'm not gonna have cash

414
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,000
why would you lie well because I thought

415
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,899
I for some reason I thought that I was

416
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,899
gonna get like change

417
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,639
we were gonna get cash back but we

418
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,779
couldn't get cash back because you can't

419
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,980
get cash back like Apple pay what

420
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:43,259
what you know

421
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,779
you're not gonna believe me what that

422
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:49,399
Domino's 18 wheeler just drove by

423
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:52,380
and I heard it and looked up

424
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,779
and I saw the big pizza on the side and

425
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,180
I'm scared why I thought it was like

426
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:59,459
something coming out you're insane like

427
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,199

like brick column we're next to I didn't

429
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,880
see that it was a truck and I thought

430
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,980
that there was a big pizza one it scared

431
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,699

432
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,699

434
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,079
infiltrator

436
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,199

437
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,740
favorite pizza place oh they're getting

438
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,740
out of the car

439
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,780
I'm gonna drive away is it a cop you

440
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,780
think no

441
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,100
oh you're scraping off the lot

442
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:47,360
dude

443
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,360
what is he doing

444
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,660
Darren

445
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,700
he's like that's like really scary yeah

446
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,340
the one downside of filming car videos

447
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,679
is we always witness really sucks

448
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,179
late at night yeah but it's fine all

449
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
right guys sorry it's raining right now

450
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,640
so that's what you hear we have to drive

451
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,860
away from that parking lot because that

452
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,419
man was a little scary but we usually

453
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,740
film for about 30 minutes and you get 20

454
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,940
minutes of content and I think we're at

455
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,380
about that so we're just gonna wrap it

456
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,240
up and film an outro in this park and

457
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,039
it's just hard to rain it's hard to rain

458
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,000
it's hard to film when it's raining

459
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,360
because then we have to go to like

460
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,500
specific area

461
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,700
so yeah

462
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,860
so

463
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,720
we don't want to have to drive like far

464
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,100
away I I think we filmed a great video

465
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm very happy with what we just talked

466
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,039
