crazy know Chris told me Chris told me

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,400
that if if he needed like if way in the

220
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,479
future like him and some girl were doing

221
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,680
like a gender reveal of a baby I he said

222
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,080
that he trust me to orchestrate like the

223
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,520
experience I told Nick the other day if

224
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,960
I am ever in the position where like one

225
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,599
of my Rel you're Notting has to find out

226
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,440
about like my gender if you're not

227
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,599
starting he's the guy to reveal it if

228
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,479
you're not do like a trick or something

229
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:34,640
crazy my unpopular opinion my unpopular

230
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
opinion about gender reveals is like in

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,800
order for it to be a good gender reveal

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,039
you have to either cause like a lot of

233
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,399
pollution a forest fire or have a

234
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,480
casualty otherwise what's the fun in

235
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,440
finding out the gender of your baby if

236
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
we're not lighting like half a forest

237
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,120
down or getting like glitter and dirt

238
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
and like [ __ ] what are you saying

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,760
that's what I'm saying like I think that

240
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,079
if there's a gender reveal we need nine

241
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,920
planes to fly by and blue smoke to fill

242
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:03,200
the entire and then maybe light like an

243
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,839
entire Forest on

what what I think that's something we

432
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,040
should do

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,759
what a lasso competition what I think

434
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,040
that that's like I think just imag

435
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,959
getting lassoed like oh you're running

436
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,600
like I'd love to just see imagine a

437
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,160
parent and like their kid is running and

438
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:48,040
like be like oh go get your kid lasso

439
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,199

441
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,839
dude you're freaking me out if like a my

442
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,920

443
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,480

444
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,519

stable together and I'll run around and

450

451
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,880
that the word lasso like sounds like the

452
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,880

453
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,160
lasso um you know what I mean I I really

454
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480

458
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
connection to something in my past and

459
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,640

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,679
numbers in the letter like nothing was

481
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,960
better than getting called up to the

483
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,559

little ticket waiting for my name to be

486
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,000
