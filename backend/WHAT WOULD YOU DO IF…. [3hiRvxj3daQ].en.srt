hedgy It's the type to say the dumb

359
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:26,279
version of like the word like instead of

360
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:28,519
like what is going on I'm The Brightest

361
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,560
Bulb ever no instead of like tent he'd

362
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,079
be like the rning like the like lame

363
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,279
version of something no the person who

364
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,079
do it is right get away yeah you do that

365
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,760
no I don't I actively do that no you use

366
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,639
like who is over there nobody stop

367
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,680
looking that way if you could eliminate

368
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:48,040
one word from existence what would it be

369
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,519
mine would be no [ __ ] saying yes

370
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,120
to me it's not Nicki it would be from

371
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,959
your vocab too

372
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,680
dumbass people don't really ask me

373
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,639
questions they know better mine would be

374
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,320
the double meaning words so like the

375
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,320
first one I'm getting rid of is bat cuz

376
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,920
it's like bat the baseball bat and bat

377
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,959
the animal and then everyone would be

378
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,480
like what is this nameless creature like

379
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,279
what is it like I would just give bat

380
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,040
one meeting instead of two and then

381
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,160
trick everyone and then be they everyone

382
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,279
would be thinking what do they say at

383
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,240
baseball games he's up at swing he's up

384
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,079
at bat we can still keep that one that's

385
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,320
the bat we

386
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,839
keep

387
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,399
get I thought you understand I thought

388
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,320
you meant they were all gone no just the

389
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,160
animal version wait isn't there three

390
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,680
words it's bat bat and what else isn't

391
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,560
there another B you're thinking of

392
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,279
battery no you're thinking no I'm not

393
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,639
you're thinking of blue blue yeah oh

394
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,120
blue and blue blue blue and then feeling

395
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,480
like okay I don't know maybe blue blue

396
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,480
and blue feeling blue color blue and

397
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,680
blowing that was crazy it was like a it

398
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,279
was like a um party thing that's what I

399
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,800
envisioned like I envisioned the party

400
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,759
okay yeah you could only own a kayak or

401
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,519
a canoe which one would you want I don't

402
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,720
there's no [ __ ] difference yes there

403
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,560
is a canoe is deeper and shallower a

404
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,680
kayak is more on Surface a canoe I would

405
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,440
pick a kayak it's way more trusty in the

406
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
water but a canoe you can like sit up a

407
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,399
kayak you have to be like leaning back

408
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,639
like I don't like that I relax no kayak

409
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,680
is way more like for beginners like it's

410
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,519
easier to fall in a canoe than a kayak I

411
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,639
think okay then a kayak you just can't

412
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,759
shift your weight okay like why' you ask

413
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,600
us if you have every answer King kayak

414
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,880
is asking me the question it's like you

415
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,120
you're clearly the professional you need

416
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,360
a job at the [ __ ] Bass Pro Shop

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,839
selling kayaks if you could go back to

418
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,839
any point in your life you lived where

419
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,440
would you go probably go back to like

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,240
Cape Cod and I would legit like eat

421
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,360
bubbles after really wait we are talking

422
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,079
physical

423
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,680
location or a time

424
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:51,399
period wait what are you talking about

425
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:54,800
nothing Nick in heart why

426
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:59,720
nothing Matt spoke to

427
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,880
me I felt it right here is that the

428
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,160
question yeah you hit the nail on the

429
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,399
head okay Matt likes to critique me cuz

430
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,240
I think I make him feel old like he's

431
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,240
just as immature as me but he's like a

432
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,880
slight variant CH you being in the car

433
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,279
is that's not a good that's not a good

434
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,519
excuse at all you could be on Mars

435
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,480

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,839
[ __ ] pee pee and poo poo I have to

437

438
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,000
me do I told Nick cuz you're like

439
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,800
slightly more mature than I am I'm

440
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,160
slightly more mature yeah okay like if

441
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,279
I'm at ground level you're like like a

442
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,920
safety cone like of immaturity above me

443
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,839
yeah you're still touching it like

444
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,399
you're still touching me would you say

445
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,759
just the safety I the craziest thing to

446
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,120
me was he said that you are slightly

447
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,639
more mature than him and then you came

448
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,720
back in the car and he went like Chris

449
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,319
that wasn't good that wasn't a good

450
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,800
thing in your defense's at our entire

451
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,120
YouTube catalog who's more mature as a

452
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,720
human being I think sometimes you have

453
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,079
to Screech to just get the full like

454
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
that that's a fact like that's a reset

455
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,280
you know I mean how do you feel about

456
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,880
that sounds pretty immature if I had to

457
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,559
answer thank you if like a group of

458
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,120
people is talking I need I need to get

459
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,240
my I need to get my eyes checked when

460
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,959
when I laugh room or like I'm in a funny

461
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,319
situation tears just tears that's me too

462
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,799
that's natural that's natural I think

463
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,679
personally that our and we should go

464
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,000
pick up a kindergarten and and we we can

465
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,799
have a kindergarten replace Chris and we

466
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,520
see how well they do I'd beat that

467
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,360
[ __ ] up i' you can't replace me

468
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,240
okay I would grab that little

469
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,720
[ __ ] by the shirt and yank him

470
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,880
out of the window and you'd see his

471
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,559
shins hit this part of the car that's

472
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,440
the thing if he told me he needed me to

473
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,400
stop the car to go potty it would

474
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,640
actually reasonable I think personally

475
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,080
that our viewers have this scope of me

476
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,360
as like triplets with you guys obviously

477
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
cuz we're triplets and we film every

478
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,600
video together but I think car videos

479
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,120
and Vlogs and being with you guys is

480
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,000
like my ultimate Peak jokester like

481
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,480
goofball you know what I mean like I am

482
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,360
so funny and Goofy and jokeful with you

483
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,640
two and that's about it like when other

484
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,799
friends join and other people are around

485
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,280
I'm I'm not acting this rambunctious and

486
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,840
crazy and that doesn't mean our videos

487
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,760
are like an act but like the viewers

488
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,159
really only see like the super unserious

489
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,000
side of me you know what I mean yeah and

490
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,880
that's just like it made me like this

491
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,480
exact moment in the car made me realize

492
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,159
like oh my God no Wonder all these

493
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,280
people think I'm like a look at the

494
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,520
scope you gave them when yeah cuz every

495
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,000
time we're filming together it's

496
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,280
obviously all three of us it's never

497
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,600
like just me in a vlog yeah you know

498
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,200
