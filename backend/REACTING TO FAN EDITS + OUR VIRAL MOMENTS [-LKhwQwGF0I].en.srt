195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,320
that's us including ourselves in

196
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
something on the Internet that has

197
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,079

212
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,839
withal like it was so funny number one

213
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,440
number one Nick rant ever I agre I think

214
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:21,720
that Nick Grant started theck the Nick

215
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,120
rant lore like the fact that so many

216
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,519
people have seen that video of me is

217
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,360
just like that is the perfect

218
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,839
representation of who I am SCP the

219
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,399
script is one thing but the exact

220
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,399
is that girl I remember that being like

221
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
one of the first fan edits I ever seen

222
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,680
in my life that's really no I'm dead

223
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,399
serious like that I like really like was

224
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,800
like oh my God this is insane insane

225
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,240
like that that clip is just like an

226
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,240
iconic piece of our history I completely

227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,040
agree that's the best Nix seral rant

228
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,839
ever I just couldn't believe I have like

229
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,480
I I have a story to tell you guys and we

230
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,519
film another car video that I genuinely

231
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,240
think is at par if not better than that

232
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,839
one and I am so

233
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,680
I am so it's so hard for me to not share

234
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,680
the story speaking of

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,000
History sharp seriously sharp and

236
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:15,839
mozzarella and Parmesan those are

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,560
four

238
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,000
Jack Nick like pinching his ears is

239
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,880
hilarious that's such really hard on to

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,279
listen to like it like it's a funny joke

241
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,839
yes in hindsight but the like the the

242
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,360
the level of which it's been played to

243
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,680
us oh it hurts my like I've like got

244
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,040

263
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,199
and what makes me laugh the most is like

264
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,079
us reacting to that will probably be

265
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,360
some people's first time like realizing

266
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,800
that that's us it's like that clip is

267
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,160
hard like I've genuinely gone to like

think that's a mediocre clip of me I

302
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,199
just can't believe how fast you can

303
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,240

304
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,040
always have a respond if I say something

305
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,880

ever could you make a joke out of it you

307
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,399

if you don't [ __ ] volley me I'm not

309

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,279
in and just started like doing like

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
washing their clothes I wouldn't do

322
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,600
anything it has nothing to do with me

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,920
unless I work at Best by then I'd be

like that could have gone better in my

330
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,680
opinion but that was that was perfect

331
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,639

488
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,760

489
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,880

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,240
time I was ever like whoo like I

491
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,760
actually look way younger seeing edits

492
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640

493
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,960
erase my entire existence from social
