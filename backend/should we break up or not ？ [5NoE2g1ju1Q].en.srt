00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Hey guys, welcome back to this week's

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,640
Friday video. Welcome back to the Stern

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,400
Triplets channel. I am Nick. This is

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,000
Matt. And that is Chris. And we are so

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,719
excited for you to be joining us today.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yay. I walked 10,000 steps today. And my

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,039
daily average is normally 2,500.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,800
So, claps for

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,720
my legs are shattered. And um also

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
another thing I want to address and say,

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,960
last week me and Chris were singing

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
Luther Vandross. Luther Vandross. Luther

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,439
Vandross. I don't know how to say

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,120
nobody. And our video literally got

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
copyrighted because of how good Mine and

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,880
Chris's singing was at the beginning.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
Yeah. Like we sang it so well that they

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
thought it was the real song and they

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,680
were like, "Yeah, we have I did also say

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
uh a lyric wrong." I'm pretty upset

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,520
about it. Which one? I think I said my

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,600
diamond light instead of my guiding

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
light. I almost wore a vest today for

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,000
today's video. Why? You didn't have

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
allergies today. Exactly. Huge news for

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,920
the Sternial Triplet community. Like

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
major news. Like everyone red alarm.

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,199
Everyone needs to know. Guess what

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
happened today. Hey, should I get a drum

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
roll? Then Chris, you can tell them what

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,760
you drum roll for me if you don't know

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,820
who's drum rolling.

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,720
I can drum roll.

34
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,680
[Music]

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,680
The plumber came. The plumber finally

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
came and he fixed our shower head. So,

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
our shower pressure is really good. We

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,600
have amazing hot water. So, I feel

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,920
genuinely like the highest energy I've

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,920
felt in a really long time just from

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
knowing that like not that I was dirty,

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
but it was so much easier for me to like

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
clean head to toe today and just that

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
refreshing kind of like spa treatment in

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
my own home. It really it really turned

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
[ __ ] around for me. A normal average

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,600
shower. Literally an average. I

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,159
literally I I took a twominute shower

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,399
because I was I was overwhelmed by the

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
amount of water coming out. I was like,

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,280
"How good is this?" Like, I genuinely I

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
think this is like the best mood I've

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
been in in like months. No, it's great.

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
And it's all due to good good water

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,799
pressure. So, shout out to two guys that

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,320
were here working on our pipes all day.

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
Because they killed it. They really

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,040
turned it out. They chewed. They ate

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,360
down. What else did they do? Clock it.

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,160
Guys, it's really hot in here. Like, we

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
so hot. Shout out to the two guys that

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,920
were just working our pipes today cuz

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
they they did it like I did not say it

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,640
like that. They did it like magic. Come

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,400
on. They did. Shop Space Camp Kool-Aid

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,239
collab. Honestly, they spent most of

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
their time in Matt's pipes to the point

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,599
where he actually has to delay the usage

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,599
of his pipes again. I know. OMG. The

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
Space Camp Kool-Aid collab is limited

71
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,200
edition. And so the minute it sells out,

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
it will never come back again. And

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
that's why it hasn't sold out yet is

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
because once it's gone, it's gone

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
forever. So there's a lot of quantities

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,800
of it. But I will say the one day that

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,800
it does run out and it does sell out.

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,319
When that tap runs dry, it's going to be

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
gone forever. So, shop now while

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
supplies last. I have to beat this level

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
of um

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
Give me your phone. Give me your phone.

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
I'm playing it. No, you're not. It

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
actually throws my energy. Like, I was

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
about to introduce the video, but now

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm just like, now I know you're focused

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,720
on like matching colors and shapes like

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
a baby. So, it like throws my vibe. You

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
know what I mean? Why intro we're going

90
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
to do together if he's too busy [ __ ]

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,720
putting triangles and squares together?

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
It's diamonds, clovers, castles, and and

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
I don't know what that is. Bears. Oh my.

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,080
Are you done?

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
You just think you're the funniest guy

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,720
ever, huh? Um, I think there's actual

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,720
public records of you stating that.

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,920
We are going to be responding to you

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,519
guys, should we break up or not? We said

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,360
for an upcoming video, we wanted to read

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
and react to your guys' responses to the

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,519
question, should we break up or not? If

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
you guys are in a relationship or a

104
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,120
toxic friendship situation, give us some

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
stories and details and we might just

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
answer if you should break up or not. 5

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,760
hours ago, we posted that on our sur

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,799
triplets Instagram story and guess how

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:59,840
many responses we got since 5 hours ago.

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,560
I have no idea. I have no clue. 20,000.

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,200
I was a bit We're not if we land on your

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,200
story and we give bad advice, don't take

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,720
it.

114
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,080
It just because it's we're telling you

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,239
to do it doesn't mean it's the best

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
situation. We all know that. We are by

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,320
absolutely no means equipped to give any

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
sort of advice. Correct. I'm the most

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
equipped. Let's do it. All right. I love

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,639
your Hooter shirt, by the way, Nick.

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
Thank you. I love it. I'm equipped to

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
give advice, but I'm I'm going to joke

123
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
around today, so it's like it's okay.

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,680
You don't have to [ __ ] get your hand

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,240
off of me. Punched my knuckles, dude.

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
Literal knuckle sandwich. If you were to

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,840
be a straight man, Nick, would you

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,759
prefer Hooters? Like boobs or butt? What

129
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,759
What's What's your preferred? If you're

130
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
a guy,

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,160
what do you a guy? First of all, no. If

132
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
you're a straight, I'm a real authentic

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
normal guy is what he's trying to say,

134
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,960
man. If I was normal, if I was normal,

135
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
say that. That's what you're trying to

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,680
say. No, it's not. You're saying if I

137
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
was normal, what would I like on a girl?

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
Shut the [ __ ] up. You know, I made Pride

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
Month, Chris, you know, I made an error.

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
I don't know. I think it just shows

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,080
where your like mindset is at. You're

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,039
insane. Tits are ass. Nick,

143
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,360
what's your answer, gay boy? I genuinely

144
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:18,639
find zero like like I I don't have any

145
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,919
sexual interest in women at all. H,

146
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,440
boring answer. Oh. Oh. So, what what's

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
your

148
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Did you hear that? Yeah. Who's here?

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,560
Creek upstairs or something? What the

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,199
heck? Creek and like water starts

151
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,680
bursting through the pipes. Okay, buddy.

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,240
I hope not. The plumber came today.

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Classic Creek joke. You wouldn't get it.

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,400
What are you talking about? Before we

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
get into it, should we talk about Love

156
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,440
Island? Holy smokes. Talking about

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
should we break up or not. This show is

158
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,680
getting crazy. It is. That's what

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,280
inspired the video is Nick's love for

160
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
Love Island right now. I'm not even

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,160
really like aggressive. Stayed on the

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,320
island. No, like he got his passport for

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,000
that. Dude, I'm like really heartbroken

164
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,440
for Jaylen leaving. Like Jaylen leaving

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
was just sad cuz he just like he looks

166
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,479
like such a kind guy. I really really

167
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
love him. Would you couple up with him?

168
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,919
Can you stop? I just don't understand

169
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
how someone's like family could watch

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,600
it. Like if I was like imagine if you

171
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
went on Love Island, I I'm not watching

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
that season. I can't. Well, I'm not

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,960
going on that show. Yeah, but it's okay.

174
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,919
Whatever. If I was normal, I might. But

175
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,240
chill out, Nick. You're so hot. I'm

176
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,080
kidding. Anyways, let's get into some of

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,919
these responses. Way too I can't film.

178
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,319
It's not hot. It's I'm sweating. Get an

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,080
ice pack and fill your boots. Like, I'm

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
sweating. I don't know what to tell you.

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
I saw someone post a [ __ ] idiotic Tik

182
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
Tok the other day. Putting ice in your

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
belly button helps cool you down while

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,479
you tan. I'm like, no [ __ ] [ __ ]

185
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,120
You're putting a frozen ice cubes on

186
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,919
your body. It'll cool you down. It's

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,680
like, do we need TikTok to tell us this?

188
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,319
All right, let's go. Let me get my

189
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
laptop. Let me get my laptop. Someone

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,680
said, "We've been together for almost a

191
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,479
year and he has been living with me in

192
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
my house during our entire relationship.

193
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
My boyfriend went to a party where his

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
ex was invited over and he knew she

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,080
would be there. I wasn't invited because

196
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,639
his friend was the one hosting it and

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,199
his friend's girlfriend, my ex best

198
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,360
friend, wouldn't like me there. They

199
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
spent two hours talking, my boyfriend

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,400
and his ex, all while I was trying to

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:27,759
call him because I'm balling my eyes out

202
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,880
at home alone having a hard night.

203
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,599
And now his ex is ex invited him over to

204
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,680
her apartment, said that she preferred

205
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,599
that I wasn't there. And when I asked

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,680
him if he couldn't go or if he could

207
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,599
bring me, he left my house, shut his

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,639
location off, and went.

209
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,880
That is not your man's. Yeah, that's not

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
your man. That's not a good situation

211
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,680
for you. If I If I had a girlfriend and

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,840
she wasn't allowed at a party I was

213
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
going to, I'd be like I would not go.

214
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm not going to. Yeah, I'm not going to

215
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
go. Wow, that's amazing. That's good.

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
That's good points for you guys. I feel

217
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
like that's I'm not saying anything for

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
points. No, I think that that's No, but

219
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,879
that's serious. Like, why would I go

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,599
somewhere where like the person I should

221
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,080
care about most is unwanted? Oh my

222
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,840
goodness. Like, is that not is that like

223
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,879
I get it. I get it. That's like if I was

224
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,639
going somewhere and they're like, "No,

225
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,319
like your brothers can't come." I'd be

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
I'd equally be like, "All right, well

227
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
then guess who's not." See you. Now,

228
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
when you get into a relationship, are

229
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
you going to like me more than this

230
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,120
person?

231
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,120
I think I'll like you in a different

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,120
way.

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,399
Really?

234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,039
I think he meant the other way around.

235
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,839
No, I'm excited. What do you mean? Um,

236
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
please help.

237
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,680
So, the person I shouldn't have done.

238
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
So, I've been dating this guy for almost

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,200
a year. At first, it was great. He was

240
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800
funny, charming, and always made time

241
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
for me. But now, it feels like I'm

242
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
constantly walking on eggshells. Uhoh.

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Anytime I try to talk about something

244
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,160
that bothers me, he says I'm too

245
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,160
sensitive or overreacting.

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Damn. Yikes. I've cried in front of him

247
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,240
about Oh, I'm getting texts.

248
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
I've cried. I've cried. Okay. I've cried

249
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,240
in front of him about it more than once

250
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,720
and he just kind of rolls his eyes or

251
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,600
gets annoyed.

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,839
I'm like really scared. We don't really

253
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
go on dates anymore unless I plan them.

254
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
And I feel like I'm the only one trying

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
to keep this relationship fun or

256
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,000
meaningful. But every time I think about

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
breaking up, I get scared that I'm

258
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,760
giving up on someone who just has a

259
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,440
different way of expressing love. Am I

260
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,760
being dramatic? You're not. I I just

261
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,399
don't think that there is any love

262
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,040
there. It doesn't sound like It sounds

263
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,680
like It sounds like the I think that the

264
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,760
issue is you took our prompt of should

265
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,839
we break up or not to vent about your

266
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,720
problems, which is completely valid, but

267
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,120
I think I'm missing the remotely

268
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,000
positive thing about this man. Can you

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,720
tell me like give me give me some stats.

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,560
Is he like is he at least hot? Is he

271
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
like like tell me anything about this

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,480
guy? Because right now this guy sounds

273
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
completely useless. Correct. Should I

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,079
break up or not? Yeah. You're telling me

275
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,160
he's a you guys met and had like a

276
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,519
magical moment and like fell in love.

277
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,680
This magic moment and then my boyfriend

278
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
ghosts me and only talks to me whenever

279
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,839
I post something. He replies to my

280
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,959
stories. He's active and yet still never

281
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,959
talks to me. Should I leave him or talk

282
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,880
it out with him? I love you guys. By the

283
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079
way, that's not a boyfriend, bro. I

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
about to say it doesn't sound like you

285
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,920
have the ball in your court to be making

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
any decisions to be honest. Someone that

287
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,880
only a boyfriend ghosting you is not

288
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,480
your boyfriend. Yeah. Yeah.

289
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,320
Is straight. Should I talk to him? Yeah.

290
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
He listens. It sounds like he ain't

291
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
there.

292
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,240
Is that [ __ ] up? No, I mean I agree

293
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,959
with you. Yeah. No, I mean if if you get

294
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,519
a hold of him

295
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,120
I got to stop. It's true though. How can

296
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,720
you say like should I talk it through

297
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,360
with him? I don't think he wants to

298
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,160
talk. It's awful. Oh, my leg's numb.

299
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,399
What? Oh my god, my leg's completely

300
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,000
numb.

301
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
They always got girls somehow making out

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,959
on that show. Can we get two of the guys

303
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,279
to be making out with each other? Has

304
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,120
that happened? Yes. How do we end up

305
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,600
with two girls always making out on Love

306
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,519
Island? Let's see big men kiss each

307
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,920
other.

308
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,360
That's Am I crazy? No, you're just gay.

309
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,640
I'm not. I'll tell you one thing, I'm

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,640
not normal. Stop.

311
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,320
I wish I wasn't gay for the sole purpose

312
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
of having like a bombshell walk out to

313
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,640
on Love Island. Like, you have to be

314
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,640
good looking for those.

315
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,079
Maybe one day, champ. I I couldn't be

316
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,959
one either.

317
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
Well, not because you're not

318
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,800
good-looking, but because you're a

319
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,079
[ __ ]

320
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,560
That did not. The plate is full, boy.

321
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,120
The plate is full. Get out of here. And

322
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,920
you're a [ __ ] loser, too. Okay. Do

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,320
you want to hear the saddest news ever?

324
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,160
Saddest news ever? No. Never. I hate sad

325
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,959
news. Oh, I thought you was going to

326
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,240
jump. Something about Royal Kingdom. I'm

327
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
going to lose. I'm going to throw my mic

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,320
at his head. I think that we are the

329
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,920
last generation to witness fireflies in

330
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,720
real life.

331
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,959
I don't think I ever have to be honest.

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,320
Oh my god. Remember the golf course? I

333
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,600
like to make myself believe. Remember

334
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
the golf course? What about the golf

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
course that we were at that had

336
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,120
fireflies and when we went down the hill

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,240
at one time in the valley thing? So

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,720
they're gonzo. They are done. What

339
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,200
happened? What do you mean? Wait, what

340
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,200
do you mean? How do you I just all the

341
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,560
actual lights like street lights and

342
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,399
lampost and all the light pollution. No,

343
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
it's it's confusing them and they're

344
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,920
just like, "We don't need to glow

345
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,920
anymore.

346
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh my god, I'm actually really upset."

347
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,279
And without mating, the lights go out.

348
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,440
No.

349
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,920
Seven. I've genuinely never been so

350
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,800
shook in my life. Yeah, they're fading

351
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,200
away. I'm shaken up.

352
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
They mate and they lost their [ __ ]

353
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
magic. They flirt with like lights, but

354
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,320
they can't. They don't know how to light

355
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,320
anymore. Get them all Viagra.

356
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,680
Stupid joke. This is a bad joke for

357
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,200
sure. I try to make myself believe

358
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,959
it was. It's crazy to think that

359
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,720
technology is a baby. It's like a little

360
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,040
infant. That's what scares me about the

361
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,519
world. Technology is brand new and look

362
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,560
how much tech has taken over.

363
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,440
Absolutely. They don't like

364
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,079
shopping at like Black Friday. Never

365
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,480
will be the same. Get out there and dig

366
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,000
for the sales. Like it's like what?

367
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
We're waiting till Cyber Monday. Black

368
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,199
Friday comes. What? We're We're on our

369
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,279
phones. Go [ __ ] shop. Wait in line.

370
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,760
It's It's the digital. You don't know

371
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,160
[ __ ] about a Furby. Talking about Laboo.

372
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Do you know who Furby is? No, for real.

373
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,680
You don't need a Lubu. You need a Furby

374
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,279
or a Beanie Baby and you need to grind

375
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,079
for it. You have to wake up and go to

376
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,160
the [ __ ] store. Dead ass, bro. The

377
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,560
internet is taking away the magic of

378
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,760
like life. I'm so happy I don't want a

379
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Laboo. Me, too. If I wanted a [ __ ]

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,040
Laboo, I'd be pissed. Laboo is giving

381
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,160
silly bands. Like, we're we're done.

382
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,720
We're done. I just when I see this much

383
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,040
craze on the internet regarding an an

384
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,959
item, I'm like, I don't need that [ __ ]

385
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Sometimes you need it. No, I do. I

386
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,680
agree. Yeah, but for if there was like a

387
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
viral pasta strainer, I'd buy it. Call

388
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
me crazy. I just feel like that's

389
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,320
something I'm always not doing right.

390
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,240
Like a there needs to be like a better

391
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,600
strainer.

392
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,600
Something that's getting the job more

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,079
done. This is like a very thing to be

394
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,040
upset about. Like we have a good

395
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,639
strainer.

396
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
been holding on to that all day and

397
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,320
trying to like find a way to navigate it

398
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,600
into our Don't get me wrong, we have a

399
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
good strainer, but I just don't think

400
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
it's the best. I get it. And that's why

401
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,120
when I see a little boo boo, I'm like,

402
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,959
it's not the best, but it's like

403
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,320
literally, Nick, it sounds like you got

404
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,079
dared by someone like backstage. 500

405
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,240
bucks if you bring up like strainers

406
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,160
tonight. Like, that's literally how it

407
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,199
how it feels you're talking about. I

408
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,199
can't with the little boooos, though.

409
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,199
It's like it's it's genuinely like I

410
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,880
hate to let [ __ ] like this affect me.

411
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,720
It's pissing me off. Like I couldn't

412
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,680
agree more. And it's like can we get a

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
more realistic strainer involved like

414
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,720
like you know that's not what I meant.

415
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,959
Like you know that's not what I meant.

416
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,880
No like I get it. It's like the Le Boooo

417
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,519
craze is just making me think like how

418
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,880
can I drain the water from my pasta?

419
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
You're not you're making a fool of me

420
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
right now. No, I'm I'm thinking more

421
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,800
like I've like seen some people like who

422
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,079
cook or cooking videos or been at

423
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,759
friends houses where they have like a

424
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,360
more functional strainer than I do.

425
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
Somebody once you get think all the

426
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,240
water's out. Do you like I don't know.

427
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,839
Am I someone you've seen cook? [ __ ] no.

428
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,360
[ __ ] no. I'm talking about

429
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,410
what happened to all the horny Matt

430
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,230
edits.

431
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,230
[Laughter]

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,639
I was think that was the craziest thing

433
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
you could have like casually said ever.

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,519
It's kind of true. What happened to all

435
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,639
the horny Nick edits? Like I want to see

436
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,240
more. Nick, you are ridiculous. That's

437
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,360
the thing though, too, is like we talk

438
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
we're talking about all this thing about

439
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
like living Matt, don't shut that off.

440
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
We're talking all these things about

441
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,839
like living in the wrong generation or

442
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,120
like being like happy with the year we

443
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,360
were born. Like the universe knew that I

444
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,240
needed to at some point be in a position

445
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,559
to consume edits of myself. Like edit

446
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,120
culture is like my favorite thing ever.

447
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,199
Like like these slow-mo like dips,

448
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,120
twists, little after effects [ __ ] Like

449
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,360
you guys go hard. No, it's legendary for

450
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,199
sure. Like seeing an edit of myself, I I

451
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,520
genuinely do feel like a level of

452
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,120
unstoppable. But I think I just don't

453
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,959
think I was ever supposed to feel as

454
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,039
cool as I do when I see like a good

455
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
myself. I think that the internet is a

456
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,640
beautiful place and it's obviously given

457
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,640
us like the platform we have today. But

458
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,320
I think that like let me give you an

459
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,600
example of times I think the internet

460
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,080
ruined a weekend getaway to like a cabin

461
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,320
with friends. There should be no

462
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
internet. There shouldn't be anything.

463
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,280
And then like I also think of like

464
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,799
school. Do you know how many kids are

465
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,559
like scared every day to go to school

466
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,679
because of like cyber bullies and being

467
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,200
like recorded? And this is no listen I

468
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,559
like let me actually speak here because

469
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,640
I'm so passionate about this [ __ ] It's

470
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,520
like it's so aggravating to me to

471
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
witness like the life get drained out of

472
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
like real life human beings because of

473
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,280
the internet. It's so [ __ ] up. Like

474
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
literally cyber bullying is like the

475
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,200
worst. I I'm not trying to sound like a

476
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
Disney Channel like don't cyber bully.

477
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,400
It's genuinely like there are people

478
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,160
there are people out there that are so

479
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
affected by the internet. And I think

480
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,240
that it's only it's only going to get

481
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,880
worse as like the the rise of Tik Tok

482
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,120
and the rise of girls growing up with

483
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
like [ __ ] this these examples on the

484
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,520
internet of girls that are supposed to

485
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,360
be like this perfect thing. And it's

486
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,679
it's so [ __ ] up. It's so so so [ __ ]

487
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,799
up. And social media is genuinely the

488
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,640
scariest thing that that that Carly

489
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,039
Granted we do it as a job so it sounds

490
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,120
hypocritical. We're sitting on our couch

491
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,200
at home with each other talking with the

492
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,600
microphones. I'm aware of how hip

493
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,720
hypocritical I sound and how crazy I

494
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,600
look, but

495
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm aware of how hypocritical I sound

496
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:59,039
and how crazy I look. But it's true.

497
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,039
What is this? That's That's a VHS tape.

498
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,080
I'll do you one better. What is this?

499
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,640
What is this? If if I'm in an argument

500
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,799
with someone, right, or if someone's

501
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
like trying to like if someone is

502
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,960
speaking to me and they can't tell me

503
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,120
what this is, I'm not listening to you

504
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,720
anymore. And that's fine if you didn't

505
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,720
grow up with this, but learn about it.

506
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
I can't I can't talk to someone who

507
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,120
doesn't know what I'm like. I can't I

508
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,360
can't enter like a I can't enter like a

509
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,720
friendship with someone if like if I

510
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,960
gave you this and you were like, "What

511
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,840
is that? How do you use that? And it's

512
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,760
crazy too because like cyber bullying

513
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,600
even was different in like 2016, 2015

514
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,160
cuz it's like cyber bullying was like

515
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,919
people still had like public profiles

516
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
when they were cyber bullying or like

517
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,799
they were texting you from like their

518
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,080
thing. Whereas now cyber bullying is

519
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,840
Gollum troll number 44 with no profile

520
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
photo and like they might not even go to

521
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
your school. You might not even know

522
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,640
this person in real life. Imagine

523
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,240
getting cyberbullied by someone who's

524
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,720
never met you in real life. You think I

525
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,120
give a [ __ ] You think I give a [ __ ]

526
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,440
about you cyberbullying me? I I've never

527
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,000
seen you with my eyes. I've never seen

528
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
you with my two eyes. I've never seen

529
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,120
you with my two eyes. You're going to

530
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,120
cyber bully me? You're going to

531
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,080
cyberbully me? I've never seen you with

532
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,080
the eyes in my skull.

533
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,039
A hate comment from an account with a

534
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,000
profile photo of someone who does not

535
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,240
exist. I'm like, who are who are you

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,400
talking to? Genuinely, this isn't Nick

537
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,640
saying this to a direct person. It's

538
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,760
saying it I'm talking like a girl that

539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
is sitting at home. I'm talking to a

540
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,559
girl someone who's sitting at home and

541
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,600
scrolling and they feel like really

542
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,080
upset about a comment 330 said and it's

543
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,799
like who are you? Who genuinely you're a

544
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,400
gray person like this? That's their

545
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,080
profile. That's the profile photo.

546
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
That's genuinely and that's not even

547
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,760
this. I'm not speaking on behalf of me.

548
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,159
Like I don't care about hate comments.

549
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,159
I'm speaking on behalf of a girl that's

550
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,919
at home that's 14 years old that's upset

551
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,919
because someone commented on a post

552
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,440
something negative about her. We I feel

553
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,080
a little crazy that we posted a Google

554
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,000
form and asked people their thoughts and

555
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,400
fully got we gave them a little bit of a

556
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,919
Are you one is he What is he does he is

557
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,039
he doing what I think he's doing? You

558
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,880
stop. Yo, Chris. Yo, it's so out of

559
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
hand. So bad. Like this isn't even a bit

560
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
anymore. No, it's not. It's out of hand.

561
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,679
Um, I feel bad that we asked you guys

562
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,400
for responses cuz like honest to God, we

563
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,480
haven't read them. No, we haven't. Guys,

564
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,200
so today I wanted a chocolate chip

565
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,360
muffin from Dunkin' Donuts. And I go to

566
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
Door Dash it and it only says coffee

567
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,760
cake and blueberry. Nick goes, "Get a

568
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,280
fourack of blueberry muffins and I

569
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,520
promise you'll get a chocolate chip

570
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,280
muffin." So I did that. I I wanted a

571
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,559
blueberry muffin once and I ordered a

572
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,960
blueberry muffin and got a chocolate

573
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,559
chip one. So, I did that and we got

574
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,919
three blueberry muffins and one

575
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,679
chocolate chip. I knew I knew they'd

576
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,960
[ __ ] it up. But it's like, imagine Matt

577
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,200
wanted a chocolate chip muffin. I told

578
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,120
him to order the wrong thing to get what

579
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,039
he wants. It blew my mind a little bit.

580
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120
And it worked. It did work. Why are we

581
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,640
all wearing green? Matt in particular is

582
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,280
wearing like Wall-E the green giant.

583
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Let's call the police and ask them.

584
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,559
Let's ask the green green patrol. What

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
would you do if like a green person

586
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,760
walked in and was like, "Ah, it's all

587
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,320
right." Like an actual green patrol

588
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,400
showed up.

589
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,480
I don't know how to answer that. What is

590
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
that? Blueberry. Blueberry muffin. Can I

591
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,360
have some? Of course. Just falling into

592
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,000
my What's your favorite part of the

593
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,320
muffin? The top or the bottom? Top.

594
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,559
You're a top guy.

595
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,880
I wouldn't say all that. You're not a

596
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
top guy.

597
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,919
What are you asking me? I'm asking you

598
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,720
if you like the top of a muffin.

599
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,159
Not my fault where your head goes. Like

600
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,440
you're just always you're just always in

601
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,960
the gutter with the questions me and

602
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,159
Chris are asking. You asked if I'm a top

603
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,280
guy. Yeah. After clearly talking about a

604
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,799
muffin. No. Fenway. Legendary stadium.

605
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
So proud to be a part of it. How many

606
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,400
Fenway Franks do you think you've had in

607
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,559
your life? Not enough. Do you know who

608
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,520
Matt literally kind of looks like? Don't

609
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,640
say this. The hashing slasher. Like when

610
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,159
he gets to the front and they realize

611
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,919
he's like a dork instead of a scary guy

612
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,320
and he's like with the spatula. Like he

613
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,840
reminds me of Matt.

614
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,840
Cool. Double microphone.

615
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,919
I'm now realizing scared the [ __ ] out of

616
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,440
me. Take a chunk out of your knee. I

617
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,120
should have eaten the muffin before we

618
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,280
filmed. Dude, I really missed the

619
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Cumberland Farms Chug Jug thoughts.

620
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,960
Dude, they had the chug jug before

621
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Fortnite. I know. I was with my

622
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,440
boyfriend at his house and I wanted to

623
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,280
go buy myself some cinnamon rolls. I was

624
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,520
also on my period and I was really

625
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,039
hungry. I told my boyfriend this and he

626
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,600
just said, "Don't you think you need to

627
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,280
ease up on the sweets lately?" Oh no.

628
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,919
Someone said that to me, I would

629
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,360
literally pile drive my fist into their

630
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,559
face. Matt literally said that to me

631
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
yesterday. Well, you're his brother.

632
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,679
Well, I did not. Yes, you did. You're

633
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,280
his brother. You guys aren't like

634
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:09,520
romantically charged toward one another.

635
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,760
I hated that. Unless Are you? No, we're

636
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,840
not charged up at all. Okay, tell me if

637
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm being dramatic. My boyfriend says he

638
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,400
loves me, but he never texts back unless

639
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,400
I double text. He always says he's too

640
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
busy to hang out, but somehow he's

641
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,960
posting from rooftop bars three nights a

642
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,360
week with last weekend he borrowed my

643
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
car, said he needed to run errands, and

644
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,120
I tracked the location. Tell me why his

645
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,760
car was parked outside his ex's

646
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,840
apartment for 3 hours. When I confronted

647
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,840
him, he said, "Babe, you seriously need

648
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,559
to trust me more." Like, am I crazy or

649
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
is this actually insane? I don't know. I

650
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
love him, but I also want to kind of

651
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,600
throw his Xbox off the balcony.

652
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,520
Thoughts? I don't think you have to

653
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,679
throw this man doesn't like you. Like,

654
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,240
this is what blows my mind when people

655
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,080
like are like like you're telling if you

656
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,600
if somebody gave you that sentence,

657
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,600
you'd be like, "Girl, leave the

658
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,520
relationship." Like, there's not one

659
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,480
positive attribute it sounds like this

660
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,400
man has. Yeah. What? Yo, I saw a Tik Tok

661
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,880
the other day and it was about it was

662
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,320
this girl saying that her exboyfriend's

663
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,760
mom had her son like flexing shirtless

664
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,880
as her background on her phone,

665
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,159
dude. That is awful. That is terrible.

666
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,240
That really scares me. Yeah, that really

667
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,480
really like I know that like like that

668
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,880
makes me feel such a level of discomfort

669
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,720
that I can't even portray or explain.

670
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,120
Yeah. Can I have a photo of you flexing

671
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
for my wallpaper? It's been over a year

672
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,480
and I honestly feel more drained now

673
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,799
than I ever have in my entire life. Yo,

674
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,760
the thing is when it's good, it feels

675
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,320
really good. Like euphoric. We laugh, we

676
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,159
click, the chemistry is off the charts,

677
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,960
but those moments are getting shorter

678
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,559
and farther apart. He constantly makes

679
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,880
me feel like I'm the problem. I'll bring

680
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,320
up how he made me feel and the time he

681
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,919
ignored me all night at a party and

682
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,640
flirted with someone else. And somehow

683
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,279
it turns me into being too sensitive or

684
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,360
overreacting. Every single argument ends

685
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,559
with me apologizing even when I know

686
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,720
deep down I didn't do anything wrong. He

687
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,400
keeps score like emotionally. If I mess

688
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,120
up even slightly, he brings it up for

689
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,960
weeks. But when he crosses a line and

690
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,640
like calling me names or gaslighting me

691
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,720
or even straight up disappearing for a

692
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,440
day, it's always you're being dramatic

693
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,919
or I just need space. And if I push that

694
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,440
sounds a lot like Nick me. Yeah. What?

695
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,080
Yeah.

696
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,919
Read it again. Read it from the top.

697
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,720
What? Read it. Read it from the

698
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,240
beginning. What? Read it from the

699
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
beginning. I wasn't getting Nick vibes

700
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,760
at all. Read it from the beginning.

701
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,480
What? Go ahead and read it. What is

702
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,320
wrong with you? Like what is actually

703
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
wrong? Read it from the beginning. No,

704
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,320
it's I've already read three passages.

705
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,919
Read it from like the middle. Then I'll

706
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,799
tell you when it's like just like

707
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,159
disappears for emotionally. It even if I

708
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,000
mess up slightly, he brings it up for

709
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,080
weeks. But when he crosses a line like

710
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,520
calling me names or gaslighting me or

711
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,360
even straight up disappearing for a day,

712
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,960
it's always you're being dramatic or I

713
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,720
just need space. He kind of just like

714
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,320
me. And if I push back too hard, he

715
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,240
suddenly gets cold or distant, like

716
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,840
punishing me with his silence until I

717
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,400
cave. Oh, wow. This girl, you are like

718
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,080
ripping me right now. Yeah, you're If

719
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,679
you guys could create a dating app based

720
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,120
off of any theme, what would it be? Like

721
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,799
like the qualifications like you know

722
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,720
like Christian Mingle. I would probably

723
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,720
do like level 300 plus on Royal Kingdom

724
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,520
only.

725
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,440
What level are you? Um I don't know. I

726
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,799
have to beat this one first to check.

727
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,640
All right. Out of the three of us, who's

728
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,200
most likely to fall in love after one

729
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,080
conversation? Don't ask weird I don't

730
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,799
like weird questions like this. You. Me?

731
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,360
Clearly. Yeah. 100% you. Actually, you

732
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,360
want me to bring up?

733
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,039
Oh my god. Turned around. I always

734
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
forget when people say like my dog like

735
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,200
they could be talking about their

736
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,159
friend. Like I was talking to someone

737
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
the other day and they're like, "Oh, my

738
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
dog." And I was like, "Oh, like show me

739
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,159
a picture." And then they showed me a

740
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
photo of them with their friend. No way.

741
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,120
Like I thought you were talking about a

742
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,799
creature. Are you actually serious?

743
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,799
That's insane. They're like, "Oh, my dog

744
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,640
and I." And I was like, "Oh, like let me

745
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,559
see your dog." Like like I said it like

746
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,720
cutely like, "Oh, let me see your dog."

747
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,919
And they were like, "Okay." And then

748
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,559
showing a photo of them with their

749
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,760
friend. No, that's really bizarre.

750
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,760
That's funny cuz like if you're talking

751
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,600
to a person that's like it's like my

752
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,760
dog. Like you say it like differently.

753
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,440
Like it's like oh my dog. Like that's an

754
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
actual that's a dog. Ask for a photo of

755
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,880
this person's friend. Like that's weird.

756
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,640
Yeah. That is weird. And I didn't know.

757
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,720
No, it's weird on their half that they

758
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,559
didn't put those pieces together. Yeah.

759
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,279
What's the most disgusting experience

760
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,120
you've had like witnessing PDA? No.

761
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,279
Stop. Last night. Really? Last night me

762
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,080
and Matt were at a burger place and we

763
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,840
were sitting so good.

764
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,240
We're sitting at a burger place. How did

765
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,559
I just uncover this? Sitting at a burger

766
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,320
place last night and well, first I said

767
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,360
to Chris, we got one burger and cut it

768
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,880
in half. I said, "Do you think people

769
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,799
think twins are gay couple right now?

770
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,279
Cuz this is crazy." Yeah. We were like

771
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,480
with people would think we're a gay

772
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,200
couple. I'm like we love We were like

773
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,360
sharing fries and like like splitting a

774
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,360
cheeseburger. No, we were just eating

775
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,880
lunch but or dinner. This couple came

776
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,520
over and they're like leaning against

777
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,080
like a brick wall and they were like

778
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:23,600
talking to each other. I've I've never

779
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:26,720
seen people talk so close like f like my

780
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,320
where this mic is is where the girl was

781
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,679
and he was like talking to her like this

782
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,120
like like to the point where like if

783
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
they looked at each other in the eyes I

784
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,720
know it was like blurry like I know it

785
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,480
was like crosseyed like that's how close

786
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
they you know what I like you know like

787
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,360
look at your mic right now it's kind of

788
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,760
like it's hard to see it cuz of how

789
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,159
[ __ ] close it is to your face that's

790
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,799
how close they were like talking and

791
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,799
then they just like started making

792
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,799
making up. It was like 10 minutes before

793
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,720
that in the same area where they were

794
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,799
like kissing on this bench, there was

795
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,960
this dude and I don't know if he was

796
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,919
like hurt or like what happened, but he

797
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,760
went

798
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,039
and me and Chris were talking about how

799
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,159
we thought there was like a pirate

800
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,080
nearby. So, it literally it was so

801
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,559
perfect of sounding like a pirate. We

802
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,080
both went, "Is there a pirate?" Like at

803
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,679
the same time we asked for people don't

804
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,679
use their free will like I want to go

805
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,600
out and just make pirate noises. No. So

806
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,360
then they started they started kissing

807
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,640
in the same area and I and I said to

808
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,919
Chris I was like I feel like we should

809
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,240
tell them to get a room before the

810
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,159
pirate comes over. It was crazy. It was

811
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,840
really funny. They were like making out

812
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,520
with each other. It was most likely the

813
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,799
three of us to get matching tattoos with

814
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,159
someone they just met. You obviously
