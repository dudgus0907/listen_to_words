scary

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,799
okay what so loud I'm scared all right

47
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,200
in today's video guys we react to this

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,680
clip a lot so you should see it break

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,920
down the first of all I bought Matt the

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,280
coffee maker as a joke cuz he doesn't

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,560
drink coffee so people were like Nick

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,239
put so much thought into like an

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
expensive gift that they would all

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,200
utilize that was a GI for yourself I was

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
[ __ ] joking everything I bought in

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,599
wrapped for Matt and Chris I bought for

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,400
my pure and only my benefit it might not

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
look like it touched me but Chris it did

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
no it hit Matt's eye and the thing

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,000
that's so funny to me too is Chris

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,440
literally goes I'd kill him Matt wasn't

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,400
going to hit me and then Chris said he

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,239
would kill me and then that's when Matt

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,760
hit me I think is so funny you can see

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,879
in Matt's brain that he wasn't going to

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,160
hit me and Chris literally provoked it

67
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,400
you guys are mad at Chris told Chris

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,239
said he kill me this is my takea away

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,560
from the whole situation Nick you have

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,159
to be more careful of your surroundings

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,440
so you shouldn't hoist something towards

72
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,599
someone's face I always do that another

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
thing another thing Matt's Flinch in

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,280
reaction you can see it first of all it

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,440
hit his cheek and anyone it's so funny

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,840
that anyone anyone I always tell you I

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,280
hate when you hit the back of my head if

78
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,319
you're going to hit me aim somewhere

79
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,159
else hitting I I can't look at you in

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,280
the eyes and smack you across I'd rather

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,599
take it on the chin than across the like

82
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,599
my [ __ ] brain okay wow you know what

83
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,360
I mean no but actually to everybody that

84
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,360
made videos about it um whether positive

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,239
or negative thank you so much cuz I

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,560
really needed the good laugh so I really

87
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,000
appreciate it no I know that this is so

88
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,760
dramatic because it's like okay wind it

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,799
back Jack in the Box like you're doing

90
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,200
too much right but I was really thinking

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,080
like really really

92
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,040
thinking and I was like we're back home

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,120
with our family and I was like like I'm

94
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,760
getting emotional and upset because the

95
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,319
reason is like I don't let people's

96
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,680
opinions or people's words genuinely

97
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,959
affect me and I truly believe that I do

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
not I'm past that point but what does

99
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,560
affect me is when I look back at things

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,720
and I think of things so differently

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,519
than how I did in the past and this is

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,920
like so randomly dramatic and I

103
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,439
apologize for it I think of me and Matt

104
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,480
and me and Matt 6 years ago and me and

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,239
Matt seven years ago and the difference

106
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,840
in our Dynamic and the difference in our

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,079
relationship and how it's constantly

108
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,439
changing is like I every single day when

109
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,959
I wake up no matter how bad of a day it

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,120
is for me and Matt or me and you and

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,320
we're arguing with each other or

112
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,720
anything nothing can be worse than a

113
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,359
position we were once in before anyone

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
on the internet knew us you know what I

115
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,759
mean and that's what I think of at the

116
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,680
end of the day is no matter what these

117
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,720
[ __ ] goon Goblin disgusting monsters

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
on the internet say about us they will

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,440
never understand the experiences we've

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
been through before we posted together

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,320
on the internet and I wake up every

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
single day and no matter if me and Matt

123
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,800
argue or not I'm blessed to be in a

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,400
position I am with Matt today I couldn't

125
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,080
and I'm so thankful said it better

126
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,800
myself I don't think always think of

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
that I always think of that cuz I'm like

128
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,240
every single day and us being roommates

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,120

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,880
like our second video ever I'm like oh

183
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,560
my God I just want to likeing Big Flash

184
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,000
gone forever like that's the thing is

185
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,319
people take our clips and my thoughts

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,800
and my sayings the start YouTube time

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,199
and they're like oh throw back to this

188
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,240
and I'm like see but this is where I've

189
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,080
been at and call me a hippie freak cuz

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,360
this is where my brain has been but I

191
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,120
think of like like how how happy I was

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,199
like and truly expressive back then and

193
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,039
I'm like now am I just trying to like AE

194
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,639
cooler and like hop on the trend because

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,400
I think that that's what people want or

196
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
am I actually genuinely expressing

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,759
myself and that's a battle I face where

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm like I'd rather feel like a 100

199
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,720
people are looking at me and being like

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,080
what the [ __ ] is going on but having the

201
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,199
sheer Joy of not giving a [ __ ] about not

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,639
about that but it's mostly other things

203
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,720
like some things I say in past videos I

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,960
disagree with you do that when you like

205
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
take a second to

206
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,400
think yeah I don't know it's no that's

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,080
what I hate when I when there's like a

208
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,800
video clip of me and I may have said

209
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,159
something like oh I don't like cheese on

210
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,479
my French fries and then there's like a

211
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,599
video of me [ __ ] four years later

212
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,960
eating cheese on french fries and

213
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,639

215
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,319
I'm like [ __ ] 4 years have passed

216
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,080
I've been alive for 21 correct my

217
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,280
[ __ ] opinion has changed oh I'd say

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,319
oh I would never wear like all black

219
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,360

220
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,159

[ __ ] half a decade later you [ __ ]

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,520
insane person pulling up like like as if

223
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,319
you're like proving some crazy point

224
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,039
like no but Nick no but they're they're

225
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,319
they're not even disagreeing with me

226
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,959
they're prying past me to come

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,360
they're getting the past me to present

228
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,599
itself to me now I'm like you think me

229
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,959
then knew better correct well at some

230
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,800
point you're not even disagreeing with

231
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,560
me you're trying to show me that like

232
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,120
this thing that I once said you're

233
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,640
holding it over me it's like if I said

234
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,640
oh I don't like carrots and I they catch

235
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,600

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,160
carrots I thought you didn't like

238
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,800
carrots they're like here's concrete

239
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,040
evidence of you saying you don't like

240
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,560
carrots and it's like God forbid I eat a

241
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,480
[ __ ] orange vegetable here and there

242
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,360

freak sorry I didn't know you this no CU

244
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,720
it instantly

245
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,480
flashes reminding me at some point in

246
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,160
your life you were you were straight so

247
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,320
think about

248
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,000
that that makes things so much worse I

249
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,200
forget my opinion actually matters to

250
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,120
you there I say [ __ ] cuz I'm just

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,640
speaking I love I'm just speaking

252
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,720
there's there the new thing Nick's doing

253
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,360
is I walk in his room earlier and I said

254
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,720
something and he goes like

255
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,880
incorrect statement yeah I love that

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
it's like so crazy okay hold on so end

257
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,399
that conversation that was your New

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
Year's resolution yeah New Year's

259
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,240
resolution Nick you got any just like be

260
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,720
nicer every day and and like do more

261
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,000
that you want to do every day I'm not

262
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,640
going to say like go to the gym every

263
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,560
day and like say some hard ass answer

264
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,279
that I like won't maybe fulfill and I

265
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,680
believe if you do that it puts more of a

266
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,880
restraint like I'd rather leisurely

267
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,440
become healthier than like demanding it

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,040
on Jan I think New Year's resolution are

269
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,040
a scam and I think that they're a cheapo

270
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,920
way to pretend you're doing better okay

271
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,480
but with that being said my New Year's

272
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,480
resolution is maybe to I'm thinking

273
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,000
like really scared too I I have a crazy

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
goal that I told Krist and I can't share

275
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
on the internet oh I remember this from

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,440
a while ago at a friend's house yes yeah

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,040
can I hear it but yeah you can tell them

278
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,040
go on a date with

279
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,000
was yeah wow my actual New Year's

280
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,839
resolution is to take the piece of me

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,600
that is like has like deep social

282
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,279
anxiety and fear of like going out and

283
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,720
like my like fear of like leaving the

284
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:48,200
house and trying new things and brutally

285
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,680
murder it and destroy it and body bag it

286
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:55,959
and tag it I I love bag and tag that's

287
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm going to destroy and kill my social

288
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,120
anxiety love that someone could got that

289
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,120

less and be less reactive like I think

401
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,519
that we're like reactive so it shuns

402
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,560

with a question mark great question Matt

562
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,159
is such a middle child and it

563
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,960
shows those 2 minutes really crushed

564
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,360
down on

565
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,400
the way Nick was kind of scared Matt has

566
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,000
never scared me ever in his life that's

567
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,159
why you never mess with Matt oh oh he

568
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,480
over he overreacted a bit but it wasn't

569
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,679
that serious I agree I fully I saw

570
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,400
people saying it was terrifying like if

571
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,559
you were terrified of this please make

572
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,240
sure you never see a PG-13 movie or

573
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,039
above and bring your mother everywhere

575
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,039
really scary things hit him on on the

576
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,320
head which that's like kind of a brother

577
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,240
thing and then he threw the head thing

578
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,039
was worse than me throwing the head

579
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
thing was kind of a brother thing bro it

580
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,440
literally felt like when they a Looney

581
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,799
Tune hits the other with a thing I was

582
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,880
like I was seeing birds and my [ __ ]

583
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,679
head was on a tornado no that was the

584
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,120
worst part of it being hit in the head

585
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,080
if I was in that room I also would have

586
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
gotone quiet and it would have been

587
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,279
really awkward like it looked it would

588
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,039
have been awkward if you were there that

589
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,799
is terrifying I don't can I borrow your

590
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,120

me hat and Chris have a actually a good

597
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,799
heart so we think let's not react to

598
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,640
someone who's actively talking about us

599
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,120
on the internet cuz we don't want our

600
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,600
fans to go and yell and berid at them

601
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:33,159
right yeah but then I think about it I'm

602
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:36,720
like you're talking about

603
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,000
me it's a two-way street and you're in a

604
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,960
[ __ ] car and I'm pummeling down that

605
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,960
[ __ ] in a bullet

606
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:52,320
train come on I'm sick of this [ __ ] my

607
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:56,880
God this is it Nick's a psychopath huh

608
00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:00,520
Nick a crazy person yeah I guess so I

609
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,760
also I just need people to

610
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,960
know when we're filming a video and I'm

611
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,480

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,520
my brothers speaking my truth joking

613
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,159
around I don't give a [ __ ] is rule

614
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,320
number one and Rule and point number two

615
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,320
is I don't act like this when I'm not

616
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,919
filming or when I'm not with Matt and

617
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,240
Chris cuz people like have this belief

618
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,919
or fantasy that I'm on constant crash

619
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,720
