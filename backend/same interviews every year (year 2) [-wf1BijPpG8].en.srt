31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,680
that am I talking about

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,500
I get recognized in public when I go to

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,840
the mall that's about it and like maybe

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,460
like everyone's sprinkling every once in

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,740
a while but that most of them all that's

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,659
about it honestly like a lot like if I'm

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,700
going to Target and there's a teenage

38
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,860
girl there just gotta assume that she's

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,659
gonna know who I am but like honestly

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,700
it's fun it's great

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,140
um but yeah way more often than last

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,399
time last time it was only like malls

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,159
and [ __ ] but now it's like if I go to

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,340
the grocery store so

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,340
foreign

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,960
real talk like like it sounds like a

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,420
joke but literally just don't be a baby

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,520
not to not to stress that much over

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,830
non-stressful situations and that

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,680
everything's gonna work out and be fine

hit 100 000 subscribers

54
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,879
going on tour which is [ __ ] insane

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,400
like I we did a show in Texas this year

56
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,319
or last year but it's like the fact that

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,180
we're doing like our own show under our

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,980
own name is just [ __ ] crazy and it's

59
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,480
like 15 states across the United States

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,480
of America which is ridiculous

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,340
um

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,599
I love The Benchwarmers I feel like I

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,340
don't really like have a favorite movie

64
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,860
but like that's like a movie that like

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,019
if it's on I can't not watch it my

66
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,700
favorite movie changes all the time but

67
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,459
I will say the movie that like stuck

68
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,060
with me the most this year is

69
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,180
the Batman one with Robert Patton I

70
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,180
think

71
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,920
I have and I am not no

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,720
biggest regret is another this is also

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,580
gonna sound like a joke but being a baby

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,739
when I told myself not to be

75
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,540
dead serious like it it sounds like a

76
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,580
joke to people but like that's the

77
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,159
mentality I have don't be a baby my

78
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,300
biggest regret is not focusing on myself

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,300
and my feelings more

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,060
collagen for everybody

81
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:33,420
learned a lot of big things this year

82
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,620
but most important is stick with your

83
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,620
family family knows best

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,220
I don't I'd like to visit all 50 states

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,159
so I don't have like a place in

86
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,080
particular but I'd love to see like

87
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,780
every state just to see how each one's

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
off each state operates I guess I sure

89
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,780
said I wanted to visit every state and

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
now we're going on tour across the

91
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,480
United States which is ridiculous but

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know I feel like

93
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,260
I don't really want to like leave the

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,879
country I'm kind of good in the 50

95
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,940
States but I just want to go to all of

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,280
them that's really my goal

97
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,720
so let's say this last year same as last

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,720
year but like get more done

99
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,879
blue my favorite color is still blue

100
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,879
love blue

101
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,260
pretty good

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,000
I feel like I've been I've I've had ups

103
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,979
I've had downs but right now I'm kind of

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,419
like

105
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:33,900
a little past medium yeah

106
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,600
hey there's always always been better

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,699
but I'm just still chilling so we're

108
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,220
fine

109
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,160
I think it's gonna have to be

110
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,120
my lyrical lemonade sweater that has

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,740
like

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,419
it's like reversible and it's got like

113
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,460
the lemons on it and like it looks like

114
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,460
it's like plants and stuff it's cool

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,830
[Laughter]

116
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,259
it's like crazy the last I I didn't

117
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,720
appreciate pants enough last year so I

118
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,820
think pants are just like some great

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,919
things I think all my corduroy pants are

120
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,580
like my favorite things that I own I

121
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,580
just love pants

122
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,080
favorite song is whirly by Dominic Fike

123
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,759
Dominic Fike is definitely one of my top

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,100
artists but same with Skies which is the

125
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,840
same as Chris's last year but like my

126
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,060
music face is Chris's music taste just

127
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,259
with like one or two artists that he

128
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,259
doesn't like that much so

129
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,360
nothing actually

130
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,460

John

151
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,560
foreign

152
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,759
obviously I want to keep doing YouTube

153
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,979
stuff but

154
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,979
I wanna focus on like

155
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,940
I don't know what I want to focus on

156
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,039
that's that's the problem I want to

157
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,000
focus on more things that aren't YouTube

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,759
but keep YouTube as good as it's gone

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,880
if that makes sense I hope it does a

160
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,419
goal for this year that I have is until

161
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,919
it's literally like the same as my goal

162
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,840
last year but I just want to focus on

163
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
something like individually to get done

164
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,280
like Chris's accomplishment this year

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,199
with this clothing brand is like amazing

166
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,940
and I just want to do some [ __ ]

167
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,800
individually but I'm not sure exactly

168
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,520
what it is yet but I will figure it out

169
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,520
I know I won't

170
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,740
yeah

171
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,120
I don't want to hold the grudge against

172
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,979
myself

173
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,979
yes 100

174
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,979
.

175
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,199
first time going la

176
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,840
um honestly my birthday last year it was

177
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,120
[ __ ] awesome like Nate was in LA we

178
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,699
were at Palm Springs it was just amazing

179
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,880
there was no problems it was great it

180
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,940

181
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,960
I have my ears pierced and no tattoos

182
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,520
I'm probably done with piercings

183
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,139
probably that's a big probably I think

184
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,580
I'm done though

185
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,560

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,479

under 40 000 it is 39

237
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,839
30 39 478.

238
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,660
my most liked post I'm pretty sure is

239
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,980
like a booth by Bryant photo that I

240
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,300
archived

241
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:39,540
yeah my most liked photos 870 845 which

242
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,480
is like [ __ ] astronomical like it's

243
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,579
disgusting how many people that is it

244
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,040
like makes me sick to my stomach

245
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,040
but it's crazy in a good way

246
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,399
whenever we go to like a really public

247
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,560
place like if we were to go to like a

248
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,720
sports game or Bruins game or like the

249
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,240
mall or something there's a good

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,440
possibility but not every time probably

251
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,959
like

252
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,120
two to three times like a month maybe I

253
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,279
want to say maybe less than that once a

254
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,019
month dude Mima and Nick like if we're

255
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,240
walking us three get recognized pretty

256
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,600
much everywhere we go now which is like

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,399
insane to think about and um

258
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,899
especially like the airport I hate

259
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,700
getting noticed at the airport but

260
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,019
everywhere else is so much fun me and

261
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,820
Matt the other day had to pee and we

262
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,320
were on the road and we pulled over and

263
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,760
went to a Subway and the girl knew who

264
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,300
we were and like we did I took like a

265
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,480
selfie with her it was fun

266
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,240
I would tell myself not to let others

267
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,760
have total control of your emotions or

268
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,459
like don't let other people

269
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,120
tell you [ __ ] or tell you what to do

270
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:48,560
especially adults don't let adults like

271
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,459
be like oh you can't do this because

272
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,779
you have to listen to me because I'm an

273
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,640
adult

274
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,560
no you don't respect your elders be

275
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,839
respectful but just like

276
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,180
teachers and stuff I like tell you you

277
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
can't do [ __ ] are wrong you can do

278
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,500
whatever you want

279
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
just be safe about it

280
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,519
um

281
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,279
to slow down and look around and just

282
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,380
like see where you are enjoy where you

283
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,880
are and like just be more in the moment

284
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,880
instead of thinking like what's next

285
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,839
um probably going to LA or stuff in La

286
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,339
that we can't really talk about yet

287
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,100
because

288
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,680
it hasn't happened yet but

289
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,600
that's definitely the biggest thing wow

290
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,760
that's such a crazy question because how

291
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,279
of how many things

292
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,920
like have happened to me this year like

293
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,480
my my own brand

294
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,860
um I think one thing like the best thing

295
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,420
that happened career-wise and the

296
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,339
craziest thing is just the fact that me

297
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,380
Matt and Nick literally like live off of

298
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,380
YouTube now like and that's our only job

299
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:57,899
favorite movie My favorite movie is The

300
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,540
Dark Knight the Batman one but like

301
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,100
that's like a very aggressive movie like

302
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,480
if I have to go calm I'm probably going

303
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,820
to Grinch

304
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,620
I love the Grinch but any Grinch any

305
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,200
version of it it's fire my favorite

306
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,519
movie I feel like I like get out and

307
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,279
like

308
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,680
Us by Jordan po like those are crazy

309
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,940
ones

310
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,940
no neither

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,579
no I don't plan to be I don't want to be

312
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,579
I am not

313
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm not starting YouTube earlier I feel

314
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,779
like Mima and Nick always wanted to do

315
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,959
YouTube but we took it seriously once

316
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:42,180
quarantine happened but um I feel like

317
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,980
if we started beforehand like while we

318
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,959
were still in like high school like our

319
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,940
our sophomore year

320
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,800
we'd be like crazy right now like

321
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,700
million subscribers or something so

322
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,320
that's probably one of my biggest

323
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,300
regrets my biggest regrets probably

324
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,279
trying to move too quick

325
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,560
which kind of goes for my advice thing

326
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,360
like just take [ __ ] one step at a time

327
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,100
like and enjoy it a little more because

328
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,180
I feel like I stress myself out with how

329
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,180
fast I'm trying to do things

330
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:10,220
biggest thing I learned this year is um

331
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:18,300
to keep your circle small and just be

332
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,920
friends with real people and um people

333
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
that aren't really there for you to like

334
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,820
just eliminate them from your life

335
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,440
because I feel like I have my closest

336
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,540
group of friends I've ever had in my

337
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,339
life right now so I'm very happy about

338
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,440
that

339
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,459
biggest thing I learned this year

340
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,459
is um

341
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,579
to Value people that value you and to

342
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,500
just

343
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,180
um cherish every moment with somebody

344
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,639
because

345
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,740
like I cherish all my moments to my

346
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
family when I'm back home I cherish

347
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,519
every moment with my brothers when I'm

348
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,199
here and I cherish my moments with like

349
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,459
literally everybody I meet and just like

350
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,459
soak in as much as you can

351
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,120
I want to leave the country I don't know

352
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,060
why I'm aware maybe like

353
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,800
I want Bahamas maybe that'd be cool I

354
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,480
think the my favorite place we visited

355
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,339
this year which is where I want to visit

356
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,980
again is Catalina Island because it's

357
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,019
just so small and like chill and like

358
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,260
just something nice and warm and just

359
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,120
water and sand and

360
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,980
stuff like that but yet again I also

361
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,860
like the polar opposite like I like like

362
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,540
forces and like trees I like love that

363
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,820
[ __ ] I like go to the park all the time

364
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,519
and just like sit at a park like I'm

365
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,899
like a little kid but I just love nature

366
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,019
and [ __ ] so somewhere where it's like

367
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,940
beautiful outside probably like the

368
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,680
Redwood Forest I want to go so bad I

369
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,579
also want to go to like just like big

370
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,579
foresty places

371
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,180
my favorite color Matt kind of stole my

372
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,420
favorite color but mine's like baby blue

373
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,380
or purple I like orange too orange is

374
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,240
really cool

375
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,380
oh my God my favorite color is orange

376
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,380
has to be

377
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,060
pretty good I mean I'm getting better I

378
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,980
I don't know

379
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,600
I feel like if I had to do on a scale

380
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,920
from one to ten probably like a four

381
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,920
mentally but

382
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,380
ups and downs what can you do how am I

383
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,000
seriously I'm like chilling because

384
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,880
you know I'm happy I'm with my family

385
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,620
and with my brothers and I've like I've

386
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,899
become very like a mental like

387
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,639
calm relaxed think a little bit slow

388
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,699
down like I really trained myself

389
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,220
mentally to just be better like

390
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,560
I don't take things as seriously as much

391
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,779
in a good way like everything you know

392
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,759
like life's gonna be gone before we all

393
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,139
know it so you might as well just relax

394
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,100
and

395
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,100
and chill out

396
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,240
my favorite clothing item I own

397
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,040
is probably my my new shorts I just got

398
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,440

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,240
much my black pair of pants with like a

402
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:07,679
[ __ ] ton of pockets on them

403
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,319
my favorite song is right now is

404
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,939
probably Die For You by Justin Bieber

405
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,980
featuring Dominic Fike that's probably

406
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,959
my favorite song currently right now my

407
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,179
favorite artist is always skies and

408
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,280

413
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,260

414
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,020

00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,280
all music like it's hard for me not to

421
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,440
relate I used to hate on like Billy

422
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,179
eilish and and like other female artists

423
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,380
when Nick would play it because I used

424
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,299
to just be like one of those kids that

425
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,220
can only listen to rap

426
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,100
but I've really expanded and like it's

427
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,960
hard for me to not enjoy a song now and

428
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,299
to pick a favorite song is like so

429
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,220
difficult like terrible terrible

430
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,840
terrible I don't want to pick like a sad

431
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,700
song

432
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,679
but I like come back to Earth by Mac

433
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,200
Miller I like cut the check by Mac

434
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,400
Miller I like okay for now by Lil skies

435
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,100
I like

436
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,220
when I'm Wasted by those guys I like

437
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,320
blue strips by Lil Skies like

438
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,760
yeah I could go on and on about favorite

439
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,620
songs I could barely talk about any

440
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,880
genre of music or anything forever so

441
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm just gonna stop right there

442
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,120
I don't think I if given the decision I

443
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,559
would the only thing I feel like would

444
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,059
be cool is if I was like a little bit

445
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,400
taller but I don't even think I'd do

446
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,700
that if I had the ability to change it I

447
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,880
think I'd just stay how I am no

448
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,880
absolutely not

449
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,820

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,160
just like it was just so crazy so I feel

460
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,960
like if I met Skies that'd be like one

461
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,820
of the craziest days of my life

462
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,080

463
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,539

466
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,980
year and they're they're homies now

467
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,980
they're awesome I love them so much

468
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,580
do I have a crush on anyone

469
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,860
not really I there's good looking girls

470
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,080
but you know

471
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,720
I don't like anyone so the crush would

472
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,059
require emotion yeah Crush would acquire

473
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,299
something Beyond physical attraction so

474
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:49,340
I do not have a crush on anyone

475
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,340
no I like a lot of people

476
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,059
um a goal I want to complete this year I

477
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,100
really want to hit like a million

478
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,340
subscribers this year which I feel like

479
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,200
is low-key pushing it but I feel like me

480
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,039
Matt and it could do it I think we could

481
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,520
do it

482
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:12,179
but that's like very very fortunate so

483
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,000
who knows but anything's possible all

484
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,799

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,820
can and just get everyone to love it

504
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,100
with my brand I also just want to just

505
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,440
like I feel like as a YouTuber and a

506
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,179
content creator like YouTube is fun and

507
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,460
all but there's so much more that you

508
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,900
can explore just for fun like I have

509
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,580
friends in music I have friends in

510
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,620
acting I have friends in like everything

511
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,179
now and I'm just so grateful to be able

512
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,340
to like think of anything I want to do

513
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,780
and achieve it so I think one of my

514
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,500
goals is just to like like

515
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,900
um

516
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,400
if life is a buffet I'm gonna go and

517
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
take from every single thing and see

518
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,460
which one I like the most is the best

519
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,200
way to put it you know I'm gonna grab

520
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,179
some chicken grab some rice grab some

521
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,260
corn and if I really like the corn I'm

522
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,260
gonna go back and get some more corn

523
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,679
um absolutely and I think

524
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,600
um

525
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,640
if I ever thought the other way I think

526
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,860
I'd be really sad

527
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
you know you want to like always be okay

528
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,700
with just like how you're living life

529
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,320
and I feel like that question is like uh

530
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,179
if you thought of that question every

531
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,679
day before you went to bed like your

532
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:00,480
mindset would just be so different so

533
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,120
if I could relive any moment is this is

534
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,460
gonna sound so corny but probably Prime

535
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,000
fortnite because Prime fortnite like

536
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,220
Season Two Season three like just with

537
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,980
the with my friends with Nathan with

538
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,679
like my older brother Justin like that

539
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,179
those were some some like my most fond

540
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,860
memories like and it was the beginning

541
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,780
of high school so like just that time

542
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,179
period probably freshman year of high

543
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,919
school I'd repeat

544
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,740
uh I don't think I have a particular

545
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,260
memory but I just go back and and like

546
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,120
like just probably witness more of like

547
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,659
our career happening before our eyes

548
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,120
like hitting 100K hitting 250k taking

549
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:42,360
the photos for that like

550
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,820
hitting a million hitting like like all

551
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,100
those moments in time where we just like

552
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,620
hit all these landmarks and like watched

553
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,780
our career unfold like I wish I just

554
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,840
watched it more and documented more like

555
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,940
real [ __ ] like just like emotional and

556
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,179
all that stuff because it was truly like

557
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,419
the craziest year of Our Lives ever

558
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,419
foreign

559
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,640
but I want to get I want to get my a

560
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,500
nose stud but I don't know if I'm gonna

561
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,659
I'm like on the fence about it I feel

562
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,419
like I'm just gonna send it one day and

563
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,419
I have zero tattoos but I want to get um

564
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,460
I want to get Rudolph I don't know why I

565
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,320
got nothing bro I was gonna get a nose

566
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,559
stud but I didn't do it I remember I was

567
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,940
gonna get it but my nose hurt one day I

568
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,260
like booked the appointment then I had a

569
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,600
runny nose and I was like do I really

570
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,220
want to get a no stud if I like have to

571
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,380
blow my nose and I just never went back

572
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,600
and got it and then tattoos like

573
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,340
I want them and I'm not scared of the

574
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,179
pain but I'm scared of the fact that

575
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,179
it's on me forever

576

West Coast Collective by Dominic Fike

577
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,400
Dior Runners by nav

578
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,659
one thing I did this year that I never

579
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,659
have done before is leave Massachusetts

580
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,340
on my own with just Nick and Matt like

581
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,480
without my mom or anything which is

582
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,340
pretty cool

583
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,600
so yeah probably travel with just my

584
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,679
brothers

585
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
um one thing I did this year that I've

586
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,880
never done before is my ability and like

587
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,500
my confidence of just like meeting and

588
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,260
communicating with people like I feel

589
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,480
like I am just like I I I'm terrible

590
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,059
reading and I'm terrible talking out

591
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,620
loud like to just myself but when I'm in

592
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,600
actual conversations with real life

593
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,640
people like I feel like I'm I'm really

594
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,659
good at that what is the [ __ ]

595
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,340
question

596
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,200
what did I what is something I've never

597
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,880
done before yeah I think I've like

598
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,620
learned a lot of how to just talk and

599
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,940
communicate and one thing I did let this

600
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,220
year that I've like never really done

601
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,620
before is just going into conversations

602
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,419
and engaging in conversation so much

603
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,659
more confidently than I ever have in my

604
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,659
life

605
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,780
don't trip over something that's not

606
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,880
worth it just

607
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,500
stop overthinking stop worrying about

608
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,620
[ __ ] everything's gonna fall into place

609
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,600
and it probably already has

610
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,120
what I said last year is just straight

611
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,080
bars that's it again

612
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080

please

635
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,460
hold on what am I saying

636
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,620
um barely ever it's like I feel like

637
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,820
whenever we go to a mall it's more

638
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,460
inclined to happen because there's like

639
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,140
hundreds of people there so it may not

640
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,400
Christian triplets so sometimes I can't

641
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,600
tell people are just staring at us

642
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,100
because they're seeing three of the same

643
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,480
person or they're staring at us because

644
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,159
they've seen us on the internet oh my

645
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,279
God anywhere that there's like kind of

646
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,960
like a swarm of teen girls I have a

647
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,720
feeling and then usually it's like yep

648
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,900
correct

649
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,520
relax like just relax you should have

650
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,620
been way more relaxed I was worried

651
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,360
about way too many things and I was

652
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,400
um insanely dependent on male validation

653
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,039
so I needed to just chill that's about

654
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,140
it just value the spot that you're in

655
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,880
because I'm not in that spot anymore and

656
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,720
it was kind of fun so I just say value

657
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,720
the spot that you're in

658
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,880
um probably assigned to management

659
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,539
making new friends through it

660
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,940
um

661
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:05,100
a hundred thousand subscribers

662
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,539
signing up for a YouTube plaque that

663
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,460
should be at our house hopefully soon so

664
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,279
we can take cool photos with it

665
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,559
um going to La for the first time a lot

666
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,679
of things a lot of nutty things

667
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,120
growing over 10K subscribers weekly for

668
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,140
over a month

669
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,700
the biggest thing to having me

670
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,799
career-wise is like ridiculous because

671
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,240
we're filming this early because we're

672
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,320
about to leave for a tour on the day

673
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,940
that it was supposed to start so we're

674
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,679
going on a full tour

675
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,960
um we've made just so many friends that

676
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,820
are like new people and I feel like

677
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,620
that's like just like a career-wise step

678
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,179
because it's like because of the career

679
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,299
that we have we're able to meet so many

680
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,400
new people and then I'd say like we did

681
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,840
so many fun things we met goals that we

682
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,360
set for ourselves like a million on

683
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,820
YouTube we passed that it was just like

684
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,659
just so many crazy experiences and goals

685
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,799
were

686
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:54,500
hit and it's just crazy like every I

687
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,159
feel like the entire year was a

688
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,159
career-wise accomplishment

689
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,840
I don't think the OG Mighty more from

690
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,760
Power Rangers with Amy Jo Johnson as The

691
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,919
Pink Ranger and Aisha is the yellow

692
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,260
ranger my favorite movie is mighty more

693
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,940
from Power Rangers and I also really

694
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,980
like Hercules

695
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,140
the Disney movie I also I'm like a

696
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,960
really little kid movie or I'm like a

697
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,700
severe crazy horror like fun mind

698
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,799
twisting movie so it's like one or the

699
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,880
other I also watched Insidious for the

700
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,100
first time this year and that was kind

701
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,260
of fire like and see this was good it

702
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,770
was crazy and scary but it was like

703
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,620
fun

704
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,539
[Music]

705
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,539
um I am currently not thank the Lord

706
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:40,279
Jesus Christ and I have been

707
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:40,279
I'm not in a relationship right now

708
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,279
um

709
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,480
probably isolating myself as a child I

710
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,299
feel like I'd be I would have been a

711
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,240
happier child had I not forced myself to

712
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,620
be alone that was my own fault so my

713
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,960
biggest regret this year is probably not

714
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,720
taking time to sniff the flowers

715
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,120
what I mean by that is just like I mean

716
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,039
Chris had so many successes and so many

717
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,539
fun things that happened for us this

718
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,880
year so I feel like we didn't really

719
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,539
take time to cherish every single one of

720
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,539
those moments

721
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,720
it's okay to be alone you don't need to

722
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,220
be in a relationship or even be

723
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,080
Snapchatting someone it is totally

724
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,220
mighty fine to be

725
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,840
by yourself

726
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,520
the biggest thing I've learned this year

727
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,419
is that Matt and Chris are and always

728
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,419
will be my best friends

729
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,059
um

730
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,559
I feel like Greece is really cool

731
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,659
looking and I really want to go on like

732
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,760
a ski trip and take photos on like like

733
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,200
a log cabin I want to like stay in a log

734
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,279
cabin somewhere that's not really a

735
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,679
place but like maybe like New Hampshire

736
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,539
Vermont has nice log cabins I did say

737
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,340
Greece last year but I also feel like I

738
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,140
really want to go where those around me

739
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,580
want to go like I've picked a crowd of

740
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,679
people I really enjoy surrounding myself

741
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,120
around so wherever they want me I want

742
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,559
to be there

743
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,760
and I feel like that's like a weird

744
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,620
answer because it's not like you're

745
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,179
thinking like someone asked your dream

746
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,440
vacation and you're like just with the

747
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,419
people but it's kind of like a home is

748
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,460
where the heart is Type Beat like I have

749
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:05,039
good people around me and I want those

750
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,460
people to enjoy my presence wherever it

751
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,460
brings me

752
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,020
my favorite color is currently

753
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,419
um it changes like weekly I'd say right

754
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:19,820
now black or purple my favorite colors

755
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,820
are purple and black still shockingly

756
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,820
ugh fine I guess like realistically like

757
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,260
all right I get see I think I'm fine I

758
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,480
feel like if I was an only child that'd

759
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,799
be fine because I'm not only child I'm

760
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,080
not fine because the reason I'm saying

761
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,760
this is because my energy goes down if

762
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,799
not Chris's energy dips so like if

763
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,240
they're upset then I'm just upset and so

764
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,220
they're upset right now so I feel like

765
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,360
I'm upset right now like if they weren't

766
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,460
here and I wasn't worrying about them

767
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,960
mentally all the time probably a 10 but

768
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,480
since they're here I'll say like four

769
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,340
six

770
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,980
46. I feel like there's a lot of things

771
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,080
that could bring me down but I feel like

772
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,700
there's also like every single one is a

773
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,980
learning point so I feel like I'm just

774
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,659
going to use them to create a really

775
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,600
really good mental health spot for

776
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,340
myself if that makes sense

777
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,899
so I wouldn't say I'm in the best mental

778
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,980
health spot but I'm gonna say I know

779
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,980
exactly how to get there

780
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,799
sweater I haven't taken it off since I

781
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,720
got in the mail like it's literally it

782
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,580
got here in the mail I put it on

783
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,720
haven't taken it off washed it once my

784
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,779
favorite clothing line of my own are

785
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,539
these huge black boots that I got

786
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,700
for our tour that I'm going to wear and

787
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,200
post on posting soon so I'm not going to

788
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,120
show you or describe them any further

789
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,500
but peep my Instagram because I'm going

790
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,580
to be wearing big black boots sometimes

791
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,840
too sometime soon I'm very excited

792
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,279
Billy Ash will always be one of my

793
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,260
favorites Ariana Grande Vlogs one of my

794
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,880
favorites currently though doji cat

795
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,919
hitting different favorite song right

796
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,620
now is probably like

797
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,659
oh my God Sweet Escape but not by Gwen

798
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,820
Stefani the girl Bella DiNapoli from The

799
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,500
Voice her rendition of it that's just

800
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,880
gonna put on Apple music it's crazy I

801
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,399
think it's pretty good I have a lot to

802
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,120
Buckle in Miley Cyrus

803
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,720
Doja cat Tate McRae sizza Melanie

804
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,399
Martinez Billy eilish Ariana Grande

805
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,100
Travis Scott

806
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:09,360
and I think that might be really what it

807
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,460
is for favorite artist my favorite song

808
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,960
right now is

809
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,880
um see it's really difficult because

810
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,200
when I there's like always like two

811
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,360
different answers to this question and

812
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,220
it's my Nick alone answer and then my

813
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,840
Nick with my brother's answer and I

814
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,460
don't know what I'm listening to when

815
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,799
I'm with my brothers but I know what

816
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,299
they play that I like and dislike I just

817
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,940
never really ask them what it's called

818
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:32,220
or have access to that library of my

819
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,700
music genre unless I'm with them it's

820
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,159
like my favorite song is 90210 by Travis

821
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,320
Scott love that song and then also I

822
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,000
have a song that I know I like that

823
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,740
Chris plays but I'm gonna take it back

824
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,340
to you because I don't know how it goes

825
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,340
I don't know the name but once no clue

826
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,860
I don't think I would

827
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,059
like because I feel like if you get the

828
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,399
opportunity to change it it's kind of

829
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,659
like magic and I feel like yo I feel

830
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:02,279
like if I were to change something about

831
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,480
myself it would be like the butterfly

832
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,460
effect might be a completely different

833
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,919
person somehow I feel like it's not like

834
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,840
a I wouldn't change something directly

835
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,919
about myself like right now be like oh

836
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,200
change

837
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,179
like this one thing but I'd say that I

838
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,100
know what changes I want to make to

839
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:19,740
myself moving into the next year that

840
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,779
isn't necessarily like

841
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,140
the answer to that question if that

842
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,140
makes sense

843
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,019
I want to meet our online friend Kalyn

844
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,519
because we've been friends forever and

845
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,080
then I want to like extremely blow up on

846
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,519
YouTube so that Doja Cat knows that I

847
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,140
exist and we can maybe get spaghetti or

848
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,700
something I don't want to meet this year

849
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,419
there's a couple people I really want to

850
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,080
meet

851
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,600
um

852
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,179
Dojo cat always she's my like dream meet

853
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,860
person but like also not like a freak

854
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,779
out way like I don't like cry and hug

855
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,240
Doja cat I want to be like yo

856
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:49,740
let's talk business

857
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,100
don't know what I mean by that either

858
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,080
but I also on a more like realistic note

859
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,820
sorry I gotta grab some pretzels you're

860
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,899
good on a more realistic note I really

861
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,380
want to meet

862
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,940
um my friend at least in my opinion Tate

863
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,100
McRae I think that she's extremely

864
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,840
talented her album came out this year

865
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,879
and I was listening to it on repeat I

866
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,320
just think she's a really cool person

867
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,820
um she follows me on Instagram we've

868
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,960
been in contact with each other I I hope

869
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,359
if you see this you don't think I'm like

870
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,099
a weirdo like no one no one post this I

871
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,659
don't want Tate to find this but like

872
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,580
we've been in communication I think

873
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,320
she's like she just seems like someone I

874
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,599
gravitate to and not in like a crazy way

875
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,639
like I promise I won't like I promise

876
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,440
I'm not a weirdo I'm not gonna freak the

877
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,240
[ __ ] out but I think that it's just like

878
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,679
she's someone that thinks cool as [ __ ]

879
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,139
that knows who I am I know who she is

880
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,720
and I want to

881
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,159
be friends

882
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,659
pretty much right yeah like I look at

883
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,179
dinner like you can come over we play we

884
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,500
all the time if someone posts this I

885
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,300
know there's a possibility of Tate

886
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,980
seeing it and that's why I'm scared fan

887
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:52,379
accounts if you post this Tate sorry but

888
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,300

00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:57,900
on these circumstances but you're cool

890
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,280

00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,760
that I want to do

924

925
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,839
it would suck because we have so much

926
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:20,300
progress and potential but yeah we did

927
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,300
good I always have to say yes to this

928
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,079

934
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,339
few specific ones I'd share a birthday

935
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,720
in Palm Springs was one of like the

936
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,280
highlights of my life

937
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,960
another thing I want to relive is though

938
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,760
moment we hit one mill and I was at a

939
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,140
Billie eilish concert with Maddie and it

940
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,520
was just like the sheer joy and

941
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,660
excitement from the concert and hitting

942
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Windmill and being with my best friend

943
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,839
and walking out of the concert was like

944
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,280
a high

945
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,280
like it was just a great moment

946
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,420
I currently have my ears pierced my nose

947
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,619
pierced and oh that's it I just got

948
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,079
scared I thought I was missing something

949
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,180
I don't know just my ears I want to get

950
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,440
my doubles really bad and if they tell

951
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,820
me that my earlobe isn't big enough

952
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,560
which I've seen happen to people I'll do

953
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,480
something like up a little bit more on

954
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,339
both sides or like

955
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,460
you know I have no tattoos but I'm

956
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:17,599
probably I'm hoping that when we redo

957
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,599
this next year I have like

958
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,320
um so I really really really this is my

959
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,180
number one goal

960
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,680
going into like the next year so I

961
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,780
really did what I wanted to complete

962
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,520
last minute like a week and a half ago I

963
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,079
knew this was coming up so I got my nose

964
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,000
pierced here and I got my ear pierced

965
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,940
over here and I got my doubles earlier

966
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,960
this year so I've gotten

967
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:42,240
four new piercings since and then I got

968
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,740
I think about 18 tattoos which is really

969
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,180
good but I'll make a tick talk about it

970
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,040
